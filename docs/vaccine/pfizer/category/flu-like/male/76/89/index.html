                                                striking headache since receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 07Jan2021 12:45 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included unspecified allergy medication. It was reported that the patient got the COVID-19 Vaccine this morning (07Jan2021 at 12:45 PM). He said he waited 15 minutes after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, until 1:00 pm, and everything seemed to be okay and he had no major problems. On the same day of 07Jan2021, he said he was now having an annoying, striking headache. He described the pain like someone was stabbing him in the head, and then the headache pain goes away.  He said the headache was not constant and only lasts 3-4 seconds. He said the headache has been hitting him every 10-15 minutes. He also mentioned that he takes allergy medication, so it was not unusual for him to have a headache. As treatment, the patient took a loratadine (CLARITIN 24 Hour), and naproxen sodium (ALEVE Liqui-Gel). He said the headache was not getting any worse. He said the headache started slow and was really painful, and then the headache pain lessens up. Outcome of the event was recovering.

I am not sure if this was a side effect of the covid vaccine or not. But I thought I let you know.

A 76-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history reported as none. Family history included wife who passed away 2.5 years before, on an unspecified date and his daughter and her (daughter) son, who lives with the patient, tested positive for COVID virus. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced little bit of fever, allergies, and feeling unwell, but described as not horribly bad. Patient stated he is ok and doesn&#39;t think it has anything to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. He stated that he thinks it is just allergies due to the pollen. Patient was taking two to three Ibuprofen once or twice a day when he goes to sleep. He has been perspiring quite a bit at night, which he stated was ok. Aside from that he was pretty much ok. He doesn&#39;t get second dose until 15Feb2021. Stated we have come a long way from beginnings of time where people would just die. He asked if he should get tested. Patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician. He stated his symptoms began in the evening of 16Jan2021 at 8pm. He started getting a little feverish and sluggish. He took three Ibuprofen. He thought he lost some weight with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Weight was between 169-170lbs on 16Jan2021. The patient operates a daycare center with children. He was not taking any medication except for the Ibuprofen. He is very active and runs a business. Only thing is, he is sad because he does not have his wife with him. He stated everything was fine. He wanted to know if it was possible one can get the COVID virus even with the injection. He asked about the second COVID-19 Vaccine and what does the first dose do. Treatment included ibuprofen for little bit of fever, sluggish, and Feeling unwell. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of fever, sluggish, weight decreased, night sweats and feeling unwell  due to temporal relationship  Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject drug contributed to the event of pollen allergy, which likely represent intercurrent medical condition.  There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.

Concomitant medications included valsartan (DIOVAN 160 mg) for high blood pressure at 160 mg, daily started 3.5 years ago to an unknown date; and patient was taking some health store vitamins. The patient previously took infliximab (REMICADE) on unspecified dates 5 years ago as Arthritis medication administered IV and apparently it lowered his immune system and he wound up in the hospital with a lung infection. He recovered completely. He does not have a lot or expiration. It was administered in the doctor&#39;s office and he does not go to that doctor anymore. It was reported that patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  He had second dose of Shingles vaccine and it was close to 4 weeks ago. Shingrix administered on upper left arm received it at an in-store clinic, and patient had slight injection site discomfort. No other vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

This morning (27Jan2021) his temperature was now back/down to 99.3 F. He was still feeling aches but not as bad as before. He might still have a slight temperature now, but it has improved. He believed vaccination was given in the muscle because it was in the upper part of his arm where the skin is thinner. He had a slight headache and was quite tired (27Jan2021). Patient asked if there&#39;s anything he should do or be concerned about. He was scheduled for the second dose on 16Feb2021 and he heard that the second dose was stronger than the first one, that after the second dose there may be more side effect, and he wanted to know if this is true and wanted to know if he can get the second dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events discomfort/slight injection site discomfort, he felt achy/body aches and pains, fever, and injection site pain. Patient had no ER or physician&#39;s office required. The events discomfort/slight injection site discomfort, he felt achy/body aches and pains, fever, and injection site pain were recovering. The outcome of the event tired and headache was unknown.

                                                I felt great after my vaccine until midnight that same day.  My legs from the knees down including my feet were painfully cold as if they were on dry ice.  I didn&#39;t get much sleep that night, but the next morning at 2:00 a.m. the pain was gone.  I was just extremely fatigued which was a symptom I expected.  I don&#39;t know what to think of the first symptom but wanted you to know.  Thank you.

After receiving his second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine, someone stopped in to check on him and he was confused. He had only had a donut since he got the vaccine 24 hrs ago. He was struggling to do his normal activities of daily living. Oxygen readings were in the 80s at home, heart rate was over 100, and temperature was over 100. The patient was complaining of diffuse body aches. He did not have a headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. Past medical history is remarkable for chronic pulmonary disease due to asbestos exposure, Covid infection the last November. While in the ED, he was treated with a liter of normal saline, a liter of lactated ringers, 1000 mg of acetaminophen, and 600 mg of ibuprofen. His heart rate decreased and fever was gone after receiving fluids, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen.  The patient was then discharged home.

                                                I received the second Pfizer shot on March 1st. My initial reaction consisted of a couple of days of flu-like systems that abruptly went away. Then a week ago I came down with what appeared to be an intestinal bug. My subjective sense is that my immune system got confused and is now mounting random immune reactions  - chills and fever, severe back pain, diarrhea, etc.

                                                Same evening of vaccine injection 3/24 - chills and severe headache and extreme fatigue.   Overnight - nausea, vomiting and fever 102.6.  Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

                                                On December 30th my father tested positive for COVID.  He was reported asymptomatic by the care facility staff. He was given vaccine on Jan 14th and began feeling ill that evening. The morning of the Jan 15th the nursing facility had my father admitted to emergency and then to ICU. He stayed in the hospital for 10-14 days and then was released on hospice at the senior care facility. He passed away on Jan 31st.  I&#39;m not sure if the sudden change in my father&#39;s health was due or made worse due to the COVID vaccine as the hospital was treating several symptoms,  but the timing seems suspicious. I have also not been able to get an explanation for why he was given a vaccine if he tested positive.  I do not know which vaccine was given, but needed to select one to submit the form.

At the time, I only had soreness of the left arm at the injection site and virtually no other symptoms except a mild headache for a few hours.  However, during the month or so between the vaccines and post-vaccine period, I developed pain in both shoulders with moderate-severe rotator cuff symptoms. This was pain in reaching in almost any direction. Also, I began to notice heaviness in both upper legs, front and back, which in a week or so progressed to tiredness and then to achiness, and finally to pain when I would squat, bend over, or get up from a chair. I have  never had either symptom before.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that on Friday he received the first shot of the vaccine. He did not had many side effects. Clarified that he had a headache that night and that was about it. Last night on the 10 PM news it was reported that someone had seen on the internet and called the news media to state that people should not take any over the counter aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen. According to the news they mentioned that it could block some kind of enzyme and may not have the appropriate immune response from the vaccine. He was calling to ask about what he saw on the news, if that was true. About 3 hours before he received the vaccine he had a headache. He did not read anything that said do not take pain medication before taking the vaccine since it could reduce its effectiveness. He was asking if he received the full effect of the vaccine since he took Excedrin 3 hours prior to getting the vaccine. His headache recovered by the time he went to bed. He did not have a fever and he took his temperature with a digital thermometer. He confirms he had no other side effects. This was very vague. People had aches and pains that they take medication for. Nothing says don&#39;t do this or that in regard to medications. Other people were probably scratching their heads as well. It does state that participants did have underlying conditions such as hypertension and that they did receive antipyretic medications for post vaccination symptoms, however it doesn&#39;t state if they were taking their regular medications, such as blood pressure medications, or not. There was no data available at this time. Referred caller to his HCP and stated that they will have access to clinical data specifically for health care professionals that may help answer questions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body height: shrunk, body temperature: he did not have a fever. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache (headache) as patient took two over the counter Excedrin which contained aspirin and acetaminophen. The outcome of the event circumstance or information capable of leading to medication error was unknown and for headache it was reported as recovered.  DSU- potential duplicate AE.

                                                He was sent to the ER later that day when he complained of headache and palpitations and his blood pressures and heart rate were unusually high.  He had at no time any chest pain.   At the ER, he had two serial troponins at 0.06, representing a mild enzyme leak.  He had no EKG changes concerning for ischemia or arryhtmia but his BP was noted to be in 170/100&#39;s which is higher than his baseline in the 140&#39;s.  It came down on its own eventually.  It was determined that if anything, he may have ha some demand ischemia from his hypertension, and that in the future he should at least get a TTE, or if he can tolerate, a cardiac stress test.  He returned without any medication changes.

I woke up around 3am violently panting and trying to get his breath.  After what could have been a minute or many minutes, I started breathing normally.  My Friday night sleep was terrible.  I woke with a temperature around 101.  After taking Acetaminophen, my temperature went back to normal. Towards evening my temperature went up to about 101 and I was achy all day.  Saturday evening was a good evening and I woke up feeling fine on Sunday.

                                                Tired; Arm hurt a bit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 14:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization; and ibuprofen (ADVIL; Strength: 200 mg, Lot Number: DC5474, Expiration Date: May2022), via an unspecified route of administration,  on 18Jan2021, at 400 mg, single, as premedication. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s wife was told by a nurse to give ibuprofen before the patient&#39;s first shot. So, the patient&#39;s wife told the patient to take ibuprofen before the COVID-19 vaccine shot and he took two 200 mg ibuprofen before the vaccine. The patient&#39;s wife feels guilty because she doesn&#39;t know if the patient is protected or not. The patient&#39;s wife gave the patient two ibuprofen before the COVID-19 shot. On 18Jan2021, the patient felt a bit tired and his arm hurt a bit, but he was fine the next morning (19Jan2021). He only felt a little tired that day and the next day, he felt great. It was further reported that the patient&#39;s wife gets allergy shots from a nurse, and the nurse told her to take ibuprofen before the COVID-19 vaccine shot. The patient never takes ibuprofen and the patient&#39;s wife can&#39;t believe she told him to take it. She had a friend who said ibuprofen could minimize the effectiveness of the shot. So, she was asking if the patient should have another shot since he took ibuprofen before his vaccine. It was a very bad advice because the patient&#39;s wife just learnt she shouldn&#39;t have. The patient&#39;s wife wanted him to have a little reaction as she thinks the vaccine is not going to be effective; asked if the patient should take an additional shot. The patient is scheduled for the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 08Feb2021. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable; and for ibuprofen was post-therapy. The patient recovered from the events on 19Jan2021.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9262, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Jan2021 15:30 at a single dose for protection from the virus at the Physician Office. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2011 and ongoing. The patient also thought he had a Covid respiratory infection in Feb2020. He had a prolonged moderate to severe respiratory infection. He thought at first that he had the flu, but he had a flu shot. He thinks he had Covid. He had antibody studies in May2020 (last spring) that were negative. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously had influenza vaccine (flu shot). The patient reported hypothermia after getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. On the same day of vaccination (26Jan2021), he had injection site tenderness. The next day, (27Jan2021), his arm was suddenly painful; he began to have chills 29 hours after receiving the vaccine (27Jan2021) and was shaking. He also had a temperature of 93.7 orally, confirmed with two different digital thermometers. He took his temperature with a new electronic thermometer that he purchased at a pharmacy. His temperature was 92.7 on 27Jan2021. He repeated it with another electronic thermometer. The first evening (27Jan2021), his temperature went to 96.5 to 98 degrees. Then it went down to 93.2 degrees. He covered up with blankets and his temperature increased and the chills stopped. He stated that this was hypothermia. He had low temperatures the following day (28Jan2021) as well, his temperature was 93-94 degrees. His temperature was 93.7 degrees. Other times he checked his temperature and it was 96.5 degrees. When his temperature was low the first time, it only lasted for about three hours. The second time it happened he went to bed and covered up. It lasted for an hour or two. He noticed it again two days ago. The patient also stated the arm he received the injection in was tender however progressed to mild to moderately painful when he experienced the chills and low temperatures. The arm tenderness after getting the vaccine was very mild. He noticed it when he rolled over on his arm. He took some Tylenol for it. His son is an internist. He said the hypothermia was medically significant. His son also said hypothermia is equivalent to a fever in the elderly. The patient wanted to know if there have been any reports of hypothermia after the administration of the vaccine. He has concerns about this occurring after the second dose. He is scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event hypothermia was recovered on 30Jan2021 and pain in arm recovered on 27Jan2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown. The events hypothermia, arm pain and injections site tenderness were assessed as related to BNT16B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported hypothermia and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

                                                my father started experiencing mild headache the night after injection (Sunday night). He lost his appetize the following day (Monday). The symptom did not get any better on the second day (Tuesday) after injection, in addition he felt fatigue so he measured his blood pressure and heart rate and noticed that he had higher blood pressure (145/90 versus 130/80 his normal)  and much faster heartbeat (110 versus 80 his normal).

Pain at site of injection started about 6 hours post second vaccine injection (7-8 on a 0-10 scale) that lasted for almost 48 hours, most intense during the day following injection. No treatment for that. 2. Significant fatigue on the morning  14 hours following the injection (could have started during the night) . Difficult to maintain balance. Just rested the whole day. Unable to exercise on stationary bike. 3. Low grade fever (just under 99 F; base line for me has been 97.6 F) in the evening following injection, gone next morning. No treatment.

There was also minimal nausea and headache, intermittent. Slept well, but had a very difficult time walking from bed to toilet during early morning  due to the symptoms. Slightly improved by 7 AM in the morning. Intermittent episodes of the vertigo during Friday and Saturday, decreasing in intensity. Was able to exercise on stationary bike on Friday and Saturday PM. No symptoms Sunday AM (now). Will symptoms recur?

                                                48 hours after the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, he had generalized body aches that had worsened, chills, agitation/anxious, dizzy, and hyperventilating/ shortness of breath.  He went to the hospital with his wife on 3/1/2021.  He stated &#34;I think I&#39;m going to die&#34;.  Patient had been off Cymbalta  for 3 days completely- treating neuropathy (previous daily medication that his primary physician advised him with weaning down the dose).  The patient was manic and had tangential thoughts- from crying/angry to laughter.  It is believed that the agitation could be due to medication withdraw.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

I am only reporting it because it might have been related.

By mid-afternoon had to go to bed and slept for hours. Got up at 9PM and went back to bed at 11PM. Sunday was better, but this AM (Monday) awakened with itchy skin, pins and needles on hands and feet (gone now) and total exhaustion. Had difficulty breathing (better now), can barely lift arms and had to miss work and went back to bed. I am reporting this because I am scheduled for a 2nd shot on the 26th and not certain it&#39;s a good idea.

                                                Almost immediately felt swelling at the injection site, which I felt as being normal.  Next day when I woke up felt a slight headache , abnormal vision issues that included sparkles, blurred vision and a general tiredness. Did not feel refreshed as I normally do when I wake up in the morning. As the day went on sparkles and vision issues remained and headache got worse. Went to bed earlier than normal and next day when woke up the symptoms got worse, I felt like I had a migraine. Vision issues persisted. Laid down around 11AM and took a nap and when I woke up I noticed a blotch in my left eye reminiscent of the shape of a fish (looked like a shark) and it had different colors. Bright yellow and black almost kind of an iridescent green and orange. The shape was still just the colors were different.  I panicked and called the optometrist and explained what happened. They wanted to see me right away. I was able to be seen in the afternoon. They looked at it, did two tests and came with the diagnosis of a branch retinal artery occlusion.  I visited my neuro- ophthalmologist on 01/28 and he confirmed the diagnosis had previously given.  He then ordered fedrate and a couple of other tests. They also did a visual acuity in the left eye (20/30) and color vision (8/8 normal) and color plates and intraocular pressure (16 OS)

I could barely get out of bed (an awkward rollover did it).  My tongue was numb (still is) and raw from the presumed chewing on it.  Walking was slow and painful as all muscles hurt.  If I sneezed or coughed, my back would hurt.  Those last problems are still true. I periodically cough up phlegm and lacking a good place to spit it out, I just swallow it.  I have for the first time in my life been using a walker for stability. Right arm is almost useless due to pain.

He started getting itchy spots on the top of his hands, fore arms, top of his ears, and the top of his head.   At this time he only has slight rash on his chest and shoulders that are not itching.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 08:40 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK5730), via an unknown route, on 17Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 78-year-old. The patient was diabetic and hypertensive. Additional medical history included hyperlipidaemia. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. On 18Dec2020, the patient developed severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body. On 19Dec2020, the patient developed achy. On 20Dec2020, the patient was dehydrated and hypotensive, he had also chills.  On unknown date, blood pressure was down to 76/50. His symptoms for COVID were severe achy cramps, hypotension, and dehydration. On 20Dec2020, COVID-19 test was positive. On 21Dec2020, the patient was given monoclonal antibodies.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the lungs was performed on 21Dec2020 and it was ok. A week later (Dec2020), he had a repeat CT which showed increased infiltrates of 10 to 15%. He then started on dexamethasone, apixaban (ELIQUIS) and the rest of the things. He had a repeat CT on 05Jan2021 which showed resolution of the infiltrates; most of the lesions went gone. CT results had improved significantly. The patient underwent a second COVID test a week ago which was still positive. He had a third COVID on 06Jan2021, but results were not available yet. The patient queried if he can proceed with second dose planned on 07Jan2021 or if he should wait. The clinical outcome was recovered for the event &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; on 19Dec2020, for &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39; on 20Dec2020, for &#39;chills&#39; on unknown date in Dec2020, for &#39;achy&#39; on 30Dec2020, for &#39;hypotensive&#39; on 20Dec2020; the outcome of the event &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; was recovering; the outcome for &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39; was unknown.  The reporter considered the events &#39;achy&#39; and &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; serious because causing disability; the events &#39;tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39;, &#39;chills&#39; and &#39;hypotensive&#39; were considered medically significant.  The reporter considered the events &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; and &#39;dehydrated/dehydration&#39; unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  Case will be reassessed when new information is received.

                                                I had no reaction for approximately 4 hours after my vaccination. Then I got the shakes and all the muscles in my body seemed to be vibrating. I could still walk but found a comfortable chair. The shakes would rise and fall in amplitude causing my hands and legs to oscillate then recede after about 30 seconds.   This lasted for about 20-25 minutes and simply went away and has not recurred. I have had no other symptoms.  As chills were a listed side effect, I assumed at first  that it was chills or some variant but I was not cold. It was the chills without an apparent temperature effect although I did not measure my temperature.

A 78-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) intramuscular at single dose at left deltoid on 11Jan2021 around 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history was none, he was basically healthy. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), but the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose exactly 3 weeks before 1st dose on 21Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. The patient began to have muscle pain, chills, and weakness about 8 hours or so after the 2nd vaccine on 11Jan2021. He states these symptoms have maybe gotten a little better, but have been continuing on for 2-3 days now. He is also experiencing perfuse sweating during 13Jan2021night. Right now, he was not experiencing this. Maybe a little bit, but not much. The caller experienced mild tenderness of arm on 12Jan2021: he explained when you press his arm, it hurts a little bit. No events required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of muscle pain was and perfuse sweating was unknown, of chills, weakness was recovering, of mild tenderness of arm was not recovered. The patient was his own primary doctor. The reporter considered all events as medically significant and he believed these symptoms are related to receiving the vaccine because he stated he was okay before that.   No further information expected. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event muscle pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

Went for a routine physical with my Doctor at 1PM and never made it there.  I had no idea of where I was going or where I had been.  Half hour later I remember being in a store buying lottery tickets and the clerk had to help me in my car. Went to bed for the rest of the day and have been improving little by little each day. Was  very, very tired at first and still a little tired now.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). I couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately. put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination. He died at 5:30 a.m. on April 1, 2021.

                                                Two days after receiving the injection, I began to run a low grade fever (100 degrees) along with chills and fatigue. Symptoms were relieved with acetaminophen (1000 mg) no more than two or three times/day. I try to limit dosage if I can. After about one week of this, I phoned my PCP to report my symptoms to him and was told that he had several patients that were also having post-injection symptoms similar to those that I was experiencing. Today, Sunday Jan 24th is the first day that I am finally symptom free after experiencing these side affects for eleven days.

Medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 11Jan2021 the patient was tested positive for COVID 19. He was sick before then but did not get tested until 11Jan2021. Events outcome was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 05Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.

No breathing problem but did feel fatigued.  After coughing up in morning, no other phlegm all day.  Then, for a week, I had trouble with balancing,  like walking after too many drinks.  That has essentially resolved itself.  OK now.  Really don&#39;t know if adverse reaction or possibly a &#39;bug&#39;.  Thought it best to let you know.

I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

This 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included COVID virus in Aug2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 9 AM and got a reaction around 9 PM. The patient stated a lot of the same symptoms from the COVID virus came back after the vaccine. The first thing was chills, patient took a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL), and they went away after about a half hour.

The symptoms were from 29Jan2021 night until probably 31Jan2021 morning noon, then he started to feel little bit better. The patient hardly miss work, but missed work on 30Jan2021. The patient stated feeling pretty good and pretty much back to normal on 01Feb2021, it did not affect breathing or cough, just fever and feeling lousy. The patient commented that he can relate to COVID because he had had the COVID and for 2 weeks he was like that. He also had the breathing problem with the virus in Aug2020, and he think he had every symptom but did not lose taste or smell. The patient asked if he should take his second dose of vaccine. The outcome of event chills was resolved on 29Jan2021. The outcome of event fever was resolved on 30Jan2021. The outcome of other events was resolving.

A 79-(unit: unknown)-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318, NDC number, UPC number and Expiry Date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the vaccination facility. COVID Vaccine was a Pfizer product. COVID Vaccine manufacturer was unspecified. Reason for no lot number of COVID Vaccine stated by consumer as he don&#39;t know. He stated &#34;I had little card Pfizer EN5318 (further not clarified). There is another number here, I think it D-6152061100.&#34; Medical history included a heart disease (A-Fib) (Intent: History) for which the patient takes Eliquis, losartan ,metoprolol and pravastatin and a heart condition. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS), losartan, metoprolol, pravastatin; all for A-Fib. Caller (patient) stated &#34;I receive my first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. I felt really tired (in Jan2021) for a week after receiving the vaccine. I have a heart disease (A-Fib) for which I take Eliquis, losartan, metoprolol and pravastatin.&#34; He noticed a slight increase in his blood pressure and heart rate post vaccination. He had the tendency to monitor his blood pressure and heart rate on regular basis but had been monitoring closely post vaccination. His normal vital signs were around Blood pressure:120/70 to 80 and Heart Rate: 50 -60. However he noticed his BP was high as 139/95 (in 2021) and heart rate 95-103 (in 2021) which is not his normal. His blood pressure is steady now but pulse is always elevated. On 11Feb2021 patient stated &#34;Started to feel very weak. My blood pressure had gone up; Blood pressure was 139 over 95. Heart rate almost doubled: 97 heart rate. Patient stated, &#34;I took the COVID first shot and my age is 79. I took the first shot of the COVID Vaccine on 28Jan2021, around 1 pm in the afternoon at the vaccination facility (a 2 year college, they were doing it outside of the college). I think I had a reaction to it (in 2021). Normally my blood pressure is 110 to 125 on top and I don&#39;t know 65 up to 80 on the bottom and my heart is normally between 50 to 65. That&#39;s my normal heart rate. I am pretty healthy and I do a lot exercise and lot of power walking, so my heart rate is &#39;not so&#39; low. That afternoon (28Jan2021) I walk, my power walk training miles. I started to feel very weak and at night I took my blood pressure it wasn&#39;t too bad.

                                                drowsiness; reduction in the chronic mucus phlegm in his air passageways; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 79-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included chronic congestion, which he had for many years; hard of hearing; and he was about 10 pounds overweight (he had weight of 219; further reported that he was good, but during this COVID stuff, all he did was to eat the whole day), from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate (FLONASE, the cortisone nasal inhaler) and formoterol fumarate, mometasone furoate (DULERA, a Merck product); both taken for his mucus and congestion, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter got some good news about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot and it was very positive. The patient received the shot actually about 49 hours prior reporting (on 15Feb2021) and within that 30 plus hours, he noticed a reduction in the chronic mucus phlegm in his air passageways. The patient had chronic congestion for many years and this was a congestion, for which he was on his other regimen, Flonase and Dulera. The patient wanted to report that this was a very positive thing as it really helped reduce his mucus in conjunction with ingesting of the other 2 drugs (Flonase and Dulera) that he was taking. The patient had no adverse side effects other than drowsiness from taking the shot on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

He was lifted back to bed and was reportioned several times because he could not get comfortable.  She went to get him a drink from the kitchen and heard a guttural sound and rushed back to find him unresponsive and blue in color.  She called &#34;911&#34; and patient was dead upon arrival (and a DNR) so the Medical examiner arrived and pronounced him dead.  She states sx started at about 4pm and he was pronounced dead at about 5pm.  Medical examiner determined a heart attack cause of death.  The family not sure that the vaccination had anything to do with death but wanted it to be reported.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms. The events hasn&#39;t gone away, it&#39;s now about 3.5 weeks and he hasn&#39;t had a good day since then he has been experiencing chills and fever. It goes away for a couple hours, it goes away till around 9 or 10PM at night, then he is good at night, then in the afternoons around 2PM or so the fever kind of comes back and instead of chills he is getting warm flush, when taking his temperature he notices it ticks up. He is taking Tylenol every 6 hours. He would like to know if this is normal and have others reports this? The First time he experienced the chills and fatigue it was on 18Feb2021. Then the second time the chills, fever, fatigue, and nausea started on 15Mar2021. The events were described, &#34;Fever: It is not as steady, when it ticks up, it is never going past 100F, it&#39;s been like 98 and 99, that&#39;s when he starts to feeling so  bad. He provides todays temperatures, this morning 97.5F he usually runs low, then about 10AM 97.7, then at 11AM 98F, then an hour ago it was 98.8F and he can  feel the difference. Nausea: It occurs when the temperature ticks up, it&#39;s not really nausea but its uneasiness in the stomach, not necessarily nausea but he feels no appetite. It has the Same pattern as the fever. Fatigue: Yesterday morning he got a blood test and he did not have a fever he was normal 97F, but he could barely take 10 steps, the fatigue varies, it does not coincide with the fever. Looking back over the 3 weeks, the fatigue is better now. On 21Mar2021 he went to the ER because he was feeling so bad, there was a little bit of wheezing and shortness of breath, they did lab work and a chest X-ray, they sent him home with an antibiotic and a steroid inhaler. The chest X-ray showed Bronchitis. Blood work results are Unknown. He clarifies that the ER sent him home the same day after 9 hours, he was not admitted to the hospital.

                                                chest pains; cough; rash; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumer (patient) via Medical information Team.  A 79-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Jan2021 at 14:15 (Lot Number: EL3248) as single dose; dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Feb2021 at 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6201) at the age of 79 years as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medication was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 05Mar2021 the patient experienced chest pains, and cough, which required hospitalization from 05Mar2021 to 08Mar2021. The patient informed that he had some stress with son and daughter to point where he had some chest pains. After a week or two of conversation involving patients son and granddaughter culminated into this. The patient informed that when he went to the hospital because of chest pains, patient was already use to that and wasn&#39;t worried about it. The patient stated he didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital, called the doctor but because of Covid, the doctor wouldn&#39;t see the patient. The patient stated he shouldn&#39;t have been in the hospital at all. In terms of the cough, he simply called the doctor because the patient wanted cough medicine or something for that, temporary thing coming on. Patient stated the cough did not linger, and it was never treated.  The hospital got into the chest pain and jumped on the heart situation and patient thinks they saw dollar signs or something.  The patient wasn&#39;t very happy with them. The patient informed that he was given a blood thinner, Heparin IV during time hospitalized. The hospital decided to hold the patient over and they gave the patient Heparin IV for a good part of three days. The patient reported that he was discharged on 08Mar2021, and on 10Mar2021 the patient noticed the rash. The patient reporting experiencing rash after receiving both doses of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. The patient was thinking the combination of Plavix and heparin only three weeks after having the Pfizer Covid Vaccine could possibly be a side effect of rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash. The doctor gave the patient Clobetasol Propionate and patient did treat rash with that.  The doctor said to apply for 2 weeks and come in on one week.  It has already improved. The patient mentions that he was also taking Calamine lotion and some spray and they all seem to be working.  Patient didn&#39;t want to keep taking Clobetasol because it is a steroid and he had been using for a month and didn&#39;t want to do that. The clinical outcome of rash was recovering. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  On January 28, 16 days after receiving the first vaccine dose, I experienced an extremely sore throat and subsequent sinus and respiratory infection.  This was diagnosed as a bacterial infection and I was prescribed a 10 day regimen of Amoxicillin 875 mg.  I started this regimen on January 28.  I&#39;m scheduled for the second COVID-19 vaccine shot on February 2.  I had my flu shot in October 2020.  The aspect of this that alarmed me was the fact that I have not had such an infection in decades--I simply don&#39;t get sick.  Could the COCID-19 vaccine have negatively affected my immune system?

An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL1283) , via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 01:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included open heart surgery 11 years ago, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom. His First dose was 17Jan2021 at 1:15, then on 07Feb2021 if this Second Dose. All the side effects started Today 18Jan2021. His doctor said he&#39;s in good health. He did have open heart surgery 11 years ago. The patient reported he is 5 feet 8 and a half inches, he is shrinking. He stated, &#34;I was good until this morning, it hit me like I had the virus. The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

                                                I had no trouble at all with the first shot.  I had the second shot at about 3:30 in the afternoon. I woke up at 6:00 the next morning with wicked chills. I solved that with a heating pad and raising the room temp a couple of degrees. Didn?t last long. But I was dragging all day and had a very mild headache (I think). I do not get headaches. That night at about 7:00 I decided to take my temp and it was 100.  The next day I was perfectly fine with a waking temp of about 98.1 (which is actually a slight temp for me). And I was perfectly fine after that.

He went back to doctor and had been taking Atenolol for blood pressure. It has always been dose 50/25. His blood pressure was up just a bit and he cannot verify who this girl was that changed it to 100/25. He did not like the way he felt and eliminated it and went back to the previous dose. He had two over a period of 2-3 days. It is in a pharmacy vial.  He does not have a lot or expiration for the Atenolol 100/25.  The date his blood pressure was up was for the past couple of times.Usually, it is 120/60-70 and  then it jumped up to 150/60-70 and that is why it needed to be changed.  It was filled on 18Mar2021, which was after first vaccine but before second dose. Patient got deathly sick over the weekend on 02Apr2021.

He never had a reaction before the one he got on 31Mar2021, and thought it may have been the virus shot. He said one other thing happened and is not sure if it had anything to do with it or not. He just started to feel worse and worse. Today is the first day he felt better. He is 80 and has not been this sick. It got really bad but today it is much better.

                                                My 81-year-old father, and my brother received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at the  Hospital  on Wednesday January 13, 2021. Within a couple of minutes of them returning home, my father collapsed. As it turns out, he&#39;d had a silent heart attack. He is still in the medical center area Hospital this morning. A cardiologist who was filling in for my father&#39;s primary cardiologist thought maybe my father had a blockage and might have needed a stent. But when Dr. performed a cardiac catheterization,  he only found a little plaque. Medical personnel are not too sure what caused the heart attack. My was very dehydrated when he was admitted, and he has underlying health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and a history of blood clots. Those are just a few of his health issues. His primary cardiologist, Dr is back in town. He plans to see if my father has AFib before they release him. I believe Dr. an internist at Hospital,  said my father&#39;s INR on admitting was 1.2. My father&#39;s hematologist, Dr.,  had told us to let the person administering the vaccine know that my father is on blood thinners. I was not present when my father and brother received the vaccine, but I assume my brother passed that information on to them.

She would like to know if it was safe for him get the second dose. She said her husband was still coughing and she didn&#39;t know, she was afraid for him to get it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included a CAT scan in Jan2021 and he had pneumonia in there , absolute eosinophils: 22.2 (Eosinophil count high) in Jan2021, absolute eosinophils: 2.4 in Jan2021.

A 81 years old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247 or EL3427), via an unspecified route of administration at Arm Left on 21Jan2021 09:33 at the 81 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   The medical history was none. The family medical history was none. The concomitant medications included warfarin from Mar2012 for Atrial fibrillation( AFib) and standard medications . The patient was not feeling well. All occurred on 21Jan2021 18:00, the patient developed symptoms, such as aches all over his body, aches all over with muscles pains with muscle pains, headache, joint pain, chills, injection site pain on left arm, body slightly warm, felt slightly warm, feeling unwell. He had chills all night and could not get warm. The reporter had not taken the patient&#39;s temperature yet. The patient takes regular medications. The patient was on warfarin and standard medications. The reporter stated the vaccine cards were mixed up because they did not write their names on them and the vaccine lot numbers looks like they were mixed up. Someone probably made a mistake because one says EL3247 and the other says EL3427, so she is not sure which it is. The handwriting is different on the cards. There was no Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. There was not Emergency Room Visit or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event was not recovered.

                                                Developed watery diarrhea; malaise; weight loss; collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). An 81-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included allopurinol (ALLOPURINOL), losartan potassium (COZAAR), tadalafil (TADALAFIL), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN), simvastatin (ZOCOR). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 details: (Product= COVID 19) for covid-19 immunisation, Lot number= EL1284, Administration date= 31Dec2020, administration time= 11:00 AM, vaccine location: Left arm, dose number= 1, Developed watery diarrhea about 5 days after the dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. Adverse event: watery diarrhea improved somewhat but worsened again after the second dose of vaccine, along with some malaise and weight loss, since 05Jan2021. Extensive investigations eventually revealed collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies in Jan2021. May well be coincidence, but interested to know if others have been reported. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Anti-diarrheals, budesonide. The event outcome of collagenous colitis was recovering, watery diarrhea was  not recovered, outcome of other event was unknown. Covid test post vaccination covid test date=19Jan2021, which was negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies and bnt162b2 cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

About 6:50 AM on February 21, 2021 told me that he did not feel well, had chest pain and pressure in his chest. An ambulance was called and my husband was transported to the Hospital. I was contacted by the treating physician and was told that my husband suffered with a Pulmonary Embolysm (sp?). He was started on Heparin and admitted to the hospital. Later that evening his medication was changed to Eloquis. He was released from hospital the following evening. He has since followed up with his primary care.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine at on Monday, February 15. That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. In the morning of an unspecified day in Jan2021, the patient was feeling very lethargic. The reporter (patient&#39;s wife) stated that they both received the vaccine at 2AM on Saturday and was asking if the event was common. It was also reported that the patient had severe tiredness all of a sudden after receiving the vaccine. The reporter stated that it had been about 55 hours since the shot and she wanted to know if this was a time frame to expect this; stated that it came on so sudden. Outcome of the events was unknown. Case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After my father received the second COVID vaccination he started complaining of headaches.   He had lung cancer, but he was in good condition.   Within weeks his health deteriorated and when we bought him for a scan the beginning of March he had two small brain bleeds.   The cancer had spread to the brain and he had a mass.    They put a shunt in on March 18th because they said he had fluid, and this was the only treatment.   Ten days later he was back in the hospital and after a week we had to take him home on hospice.   I think the vaccine could of escalated his cancer this rapidly.  Especially because he had two brain bleeds.

This morning, he got up at 6am and his temperature was around 98.8; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 8:30 to 9 AM, at a single dose, for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history in Mar2020 included had a temperature for 7 days. He tested positive for COVID and it took a while to test negative. At the end of Mar2020 until the first of Apr2020, his temperature was 97 something. He has checked his temperature every day since then. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. He did not receive additional vaccines on the same date bnt162b2 was given. The patient had his first COVID-19 shot yesterday morning about 8:30 or 9:00. He hadn&#39;t really looked at the list of side effects, but yesterday afternoon (26Jan2021), he had slight pain in the arm where the shot was given. If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.  Yesterday (unspecified date in Jan2021), his temperature was 97 something. This morning, he got up at 6 am and his temperature was around 98.8. And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees.

On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name.

An 84-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (he has had it for years. He says he uses a machine when he goes to bed, a mask). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took flu shot (unspecified) one injection a few (also reported as 3) weeks ago. The patient received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 12Jan2021 in the evening about 05:30-06:00PM. The following morning on 13Jan2021, he experienced headache and loose stools. The loose stools were described as &#34;squirting&#34; of over the next 5 days and then the loose stools started to improve. He says starting Wednesday he had really loose stool and was squirting liquid and it has bad for about 3 days. He says Saturday he started having loose, real loose stools, not squirting, but this has gone through to today. He says he still has a feeling kind of like he needs to go to the bathroom all the time. He says he never had a loose stool as far back as he can remember before, he didn&#39;t take anything for it, his doctor isn&#39;t giving the vaccine so he didn&#39;t contact him. He says he also didn&#39;t want to mess up by taking anything. He was squirting and had loose stool Wednesday morning and then that continued until today, he was not squirting, was having very loose stool, that was better, since he was not squirting. He still has some loose stools but was no longer &#34;squirting&#34; and still had a feeling in the bottom of his stomach like he needs to go to the bathroom. The headache gradually improved after the initial injection and he only has a little headache left currently. Patient had a headache the first couple of days, it was real light until now, he was still kind of not back to normal. He wanted to know if this will go away, since he is due for next virus shot in a week or so and was kind of dubious about taking it. On unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient had arm soreness that went away and was gone, he was sore for a couple days. The outcome of the events diarrhea and headache was recovering; event &#34;He still has some loose stools but was no longer &#34;squirting&#34; and still had a feeling in the bottom of his stomach like he needs to go to the bathroom&#34; was not recovered; and arm soreness was recovered in Jan2021.

An 84-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: E18982, expiration date was not reported), intramuscular on the left arm (also reported as left shoulder) on 15Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. It was reported that the patient was taking an unspecified blood thinner and other unspecified products. It was reported that patient got the first dose on 15Jan2021 and everything was fine. The following Friday, exactly a week later, on 22Jan2021 at 930am he got violently sick as far as throwing up and dysentery. He was asking if it could be from the shot. He got sick and was heaving for 7 hours, then he was dry heaving after throwing up so much, it was green bile. He knew he was getting dehydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte at 7pm that night. He had to stay a half hour after getting the vaccine since they wanted to monitor him a little longer since he takes blood thinners an other crap. He did not specify the other medications that he takes. On Saturday he felt fine but he felt weak. The patient recovered from dysentery and throwing up on 23Jan2021, while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

Hospital workup notable for CPK 45,720 U/L with CRP 109 (3/8) and low-grade fever (3/9). Negative infectious workup so far (BCx, Biofire, COVID PCR, UA without WBCs, no leukocytosis). He also had new thrombocytopenia to 84 (3/8), but possibly due to rifampin for LTBI. He remains admitted at this time, receiving fluids for rhabdo, undergoing further infectious and rheumatologic workup.

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                groin started to hurt; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 85-years-old male patient (reporter&#39;s grandfather) received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 01Feb2021 (at 85 years of age) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. On 01Feb2021 the patient felt great; on 02Feb2021 he felt ok but was tired; on 03Feb2021 his groin started to hurt, it hurt even to touch it, his leg started to bother him from his groin down and then was unable to be touched; the reporter asked if that could be swollen lymph nodes from the vaccine. At 3 o&#39;clock the patient rushed to the hospital and, on 04Feb2021, he was admitted to hospital due to pain in groin. They thought he had broken something but that was ruled out. The patient underwent an X-ray of his leg and labs. He does not have any infection. At the time of the report the patient was still in hospital and the events &#34;groin started to hurt&#34; had not resolved yet and outcome of the event &#34;tired&#34; was unknown.

Again admitted and had further rheumatological and infectious work up with negative results  He was initially admitted to Hospital on 02/12 with fatigue, atypical chest pain, melena. He had received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02/10. He was hospitalized from 02/12-02/15 and  thought to have viral pericarditis.  Diagnosis at discharge: SIRS DUE TO NONINFECTIOUS PROCESS W ACUTE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION.   He was started on celebrex in addition to the the colchicine as an anti-inflammatory.  After initiation of the anti inflammatory medications, patient&#39;s fever resolved, he started feeling better and his inflammatory markers decreased.  He was monitored for another days and was feeling better.  He is therefore being discharged home.  In view of the negative work up, there is suspicion that these may be a hyper inflammatory response to the COVID vaccine since his symptoms were temporally related.

An 85-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9263) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 11Feb2021 (at the age of 85 years-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes emphysema and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder) and Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (&#34;it says Pfizer, can&#39;t make it out good but looks like Lot Number EL0142&#34;; at the age of 85-years) on 21Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included methotrexate, weekly for rheumatoid arthritis and folic acid once daily for an unspecified indication. Concomitant medications include unspecified inhalers for emphysema and COPD. After receiving the vaccine, he experienced tiredness and chills (Feb2021). More than a week later he experienced a rash at the injection site which feels a little bit warm to the touch it (Feb2021). The rash is 2.5 inches wide, 3 inches long. His wife put a cold pack on it and it helped, the rash is not hurting or itching. The patient&#39;s wife stated it was odd that his rash appeared a week later right in the injection site in his left arm, she attributed it to the fact that he sleeps on this side. The outcome of the events fatigue, chills, injection site rash and injection site warmth was unknown.

We gave the patient something to drink, a snack, and a cold icepack. Once the patient&#39;s condition continued to decline, vital signs were assessed. Blood pressure was 140/110, pulse oximetry was 87% on room air, and patient was placed on oxygen. I notified the manager to go grab the doctor as I was helping the patient. The doctor brought a glucometer to make sure the patient was not hypoglycemic, and the result was 117 mg/dL. At this point the patient was diaphoretic, and complaining of pain in his abdomen. He also complained of nausea. The squad was alerted, and came to get the patient. At this point the patient&#39;s pulse ox was 53% on 6L of oxygen.

An 85-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 09Feb2021 (Lot Number: EM9810) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2, at the age of 85-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 20Jan2021 (lot number: EL3302) as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced Vertigo, felt peculiar, nausea, dizziness/swimmy headed. The patient previously received the flu shot for immunization and experienced Sore arm. He is 85 and not familiar with all the goings on today but heard a report the other day and did not know there was such a thing as Vertigo. He thought that was just a movie. When he took the shot at (place name) in (county name) on 20Jan2021, soon thereafter, not that day but maybe next, he felt peculiar. It was just uneasiness and he did not feel right. That went on and on 09Feb2021, he got second shot and he got swimmy headed, but it has continued on since then and probably gotten worse, especially when he gets up in the morning. He has to hold on until he gets balanced or coordinated. It just doesn&#39;t seem right After he gets up and gets going, it is not as prevalent. But then sometimes it strikes him and he is just completely out of it. He later stated the peculiar feeling and swimmy headedness started the same day as the first injection, but he just did not really pay attention to it and thought it was just one of those things that you accept with getting older. Wife and he both went and he thought his feelings were merely from excitement or depletion or exhaustion. He felt like he had weakness and he just felt different. He got it at noon and waited for 15 minutes. Because of the events around him at the time, it did not register with him because it was the stress of driving 30 miles through expressway. Old people aren&#39;t used to driving that far. It got worse after the second shot and then he really knew something was wrong. When you are old, you have these feelings and pains and aches and all that stuff, and you just accept it as being old. It did not register with him until a couple of weeks ago when he heard it on TV about Vertigo and he said that is what he has. The swimmy headedness was really more noticeable after second shot, it brought it on stronger. He does not complain about things and thought it may just be getting old. He said it just kept on and getting a little worse and worse. Then he said something is not right and one day he bent over to look up and almost blacked out because of sensation in equilibrium or vision or whatever. He got scared and that was a couple of weeks ago. (name) was not cognizant of what was going on until he heard on television about Vertigo. One of the news channel mentioned or somebody mentioned it. It was just general things. He confirmed it was regarding someone who had gotten Vertigo after getting the vaccine but did not have a particular person to report on. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. The outcome of the event dizziness aggravated and Weakness was not recovered, other events was unknown.

It is now 9:00 a.m. I am still cold but not shivering. Also feel weak.

An 86-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 86-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 24Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER2613) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cerebrovascular disease, HTN, DMII, dementia. Concomitant medications included metformin, glimepiride, amlodipine, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN (E.C.)), senna alexandrina leaf, and vitamin D. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6206) at the age of 86-year-old, on 03Mar2021 11:00 AM, intramuscular at the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation.

The patient was hospitalized due to the event minimally responsive on 05Apr2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the Company considers the reported event minimally responsive is unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccination but more likely an inter-current medical condition in this 86-year-old male patient with medical history of cerebrovascular disease, HTN, DMII, dementia.

An 87-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3249, intramuscular on left arm on 13Jan2021 (Time the vaccination was given: 13:00-13:15) at the age of  87-years-old at single dose for prevention because of age group.  Medical history included covid-19 in Jun2020, forgetful from an unknown date, he got a little forgetful sometimes, so he may have forgotten to tell her.  This occurred prior to getting the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Family medical history was none. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week on 13Jan2021, he was really sick in Jan2021. The patient had weak legs anyway, but he got so weak.  Weakness in legs started at night on 13Jan2021, around 20:00. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. He never complained of any symptoms and did not know if there were other symptoms, because he did not complain.  He fell on Thursday night on 14Jan2021. He got the vaccine around 1:00-1:15pm, and got so weak, that he went to the bathroom and he fell in the floor.  His legs just continued to get worse.  It started on Wednesday night on 13Jan2021.  He could not walk in Jan2021.  Thursday was the worst. By Friday, it started to get better.  He did not get hospitalized.  He could not get up without help. The patient had Covid 19 in Jun2020. He had a lot of symptoms after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported her father fell in the bathroom while brushing his teeth and her brother had to come over to get him up. The reporter was starting to wonder if he should take the second dose. The outcome of the events Weakness in legs and fell was resolving and of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered event Weakness in legs was serious due to medically significant and disabling; considered event fall was serious due to medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of the events muscular weakness, fall and gait disturbance cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the elderly patient&#39;s underlying conditions. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Bleeding out of ileostomy; Did not sleep; no appetite; Feeling unwell; achy; tired; weaker; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter).  An 88-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 09:45 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for Prevention. Medical history included Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, Quadruple Bypass surgery in 2003, High blood pressure. He was Diabetic, was a heart patient. Before he had his ostomy, he had colitis that causes the patient to bleed when pooping and his guts were ravaged. His stomach might be weakened from having it for years and years in his 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s to early 50&#39;s.  Family medical history included Grandfather died at 42 of bleeding ulcer in his stomach. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. He has allergies to pills but was not taking any.  He does not have a fever.  She has the names of the pills he is allergic to as follows: Simvastatin, Lisinopril, Losartan, Aggrenox cap.  They are listed on his report from (institution name withheld) that he has allergies to. He received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 30Jan2021. There was no prescriber on 30Jan2021 through 01Feb2021, everything was good. On 02Feb2021, that is when his ostomy shot out blood like a faucet when he was taking a shower.  He was changing the bandage that day, he was changing his right sided ileostomy bag and he told her that blood shot out of it &#34;like a faucet.&#34; On 3Feb2021 was nerve wracking, but there was no blood.  He was changing his ostomy pad again on 04Feb2021 and it started bleeding so much that he went to the hospital. He was discharged within a few hours because &#34;they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&#34; He has had colitis for years and has an ileostomy, where they take out a bunch of his colon.  This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.  On 05Feb2021 his ostomy bled a little bit more but it has not bled again since 06Feb2021. She also reports that he feels, &#34; icky, tired, no appetite and achy.&#34; The feeling unwell began on 7Feb2021. That worsened since loss of blood made him weaker and worried.  When he got back from the hospital/ER, he said they were rude.  There was a blizzard.  He checked in around 8pm and they discharged him around 11pm that same night.  ER visit at the institution on 04Feb2021, 8pm to 11pm and released. They performed CT scan abdomen and Pelvis and IV. Results are unknown. Now he was good. The achiness and tiredness was between persistent and worsened. He was worrying now. She took his forehead temperature and it was good on 7Feb2021.  She took everybody&#39;s and they were all good.  He just feels icky and the blood thing is nerve wracking. He is convinced it is coming back. He was not on a blood thinner or anything listed on the vaccine fact sheet. The patient experienced Feeling unwell on 6Feb2021 with outcome of Not Recovered (Feeling unwell was reported as worsened), achy and tired on 5Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, No appetite on 7Feb202108:30  with outcome of Not Recovered, Bleeding out of ileostomy on 2Feb2021 09:45 with outcome of Recovering, Did not sleep on 7Feb2021 21:30  with outcome of Not Recovered. He has a lot of the risk factors; He is Diabetic, is a heart patient, and has high blood pressure, but he really wanted to get the shot. The patient&#39;s primary care provider&#39;s nurse do not believe the bleeding had anything to do with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                he is coughing now; soreness in muscle on site on injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 88-year-old male patient (husband) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL9261, expiry date: May2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 11:30 AM at 0.3 mL, single on left deltoid (reported as &#34;0.3ml by IM (intramuscular) injection once to in left shoulder, the usual place&#34;) for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as &#34;88 and they are not anxious for him to get COVID/he has deep lung disease and if he didn&#39;t get it, he may die from it&#34;).  Vaccination facility type was a special clinic set up by hospital. Vaccine was not administered at facility. Medical history included deep lung disease, total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, asthmatic, lung problems. Patient has no compromised immune system. Patient&#39;s only allergic reaction was old tetanus (tetanus toxoid) but he was really fine. Patient had tetanus toxoid in 1950, he was a very young man and he has not had it since then, the reporter does not believe they give it anymore. No family medical history relevant to adverse events, also reported as &#34;No, but there is no history for the COVID vaccine, we are only 3 months into it&#34;. Concomitant medication included omalizumab (XOLAIR) for lung problems and asthmatic. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer product. After the first 3 days, patient got the vaccine on 23Jan2021. Patient is now on day 9 but the first 3 days after, he had no side effects. On the 4th day (27Jan2021), he developed soreness in his muscle on the site of injection, and the next day it was increasingly sore, on the 28Jan2021, 29Jan2021, 30Jan2021, and was quite incapacitated, he could not use it, it was really bad, now he was beginning to improve. The reporter wanted to Pfizer to know the length and depth. It only had to do with the use of the muscle not, he was not suffering when not using the arm, a couple days were really bad, he did feel it when he was not using it, but most of the time, the pain came when he needed to use it. The reporter talked to enough who said don&#39;t worry, but patient had a total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, in that arm and asked &#34;could that injection exacerbate anything going on there?  Most doctors said to not worry about it&#34;. The reporter wants to help COVID. The reporter got hers minute after his husband and she had no side effects whatsoever, so if there was any question about something going on at the site, she could not imagine hers would be so perfect. The event did not require emergency room and physician office visit, further reported that patient had multiple health issues. Patient was coughing now(01Feb2021), over the years, reporter has learned to deal with many things without going to Urgent Care, ER, patient was 88 and the reporter wanted to keep his husband out due to COVID. The reporter called friends who were medical doctors (MDs), as the reporter was worried, the patient was coming out of it. Patient has one injection, a new medication he was on a biologic. Patient was first refused to get the COVID vaccine due to biologic, and the day before he had received it, so they discussed and decided because of biologic, &#34;XOLAIR&#34;. There were no adverse events prior vaccinations. Patient went on Friday for his next Xolair, he had no problems then. There were no relevant tests and was reported that patient has been there the whole time, at home, has been under quarantine since last Mar2020. If anything threw up a red flag, reporter would think it would be something they would explore, maybe for the Xolair, when this question came up, it was several days before the vaccine, patient was refused. Patient was asked if there were other injections, reporter said that his husband would have &#34;one the one day before&#34;, and they canceled his appointment, and he went to the doctor, the pulmonologist, who administered Xolair, and reporter said that his husband was refused, the doctor said no, &#34;it&#39;s a biologic, he was giving it to patients having the COVID vaccine, there were no interactions, and reinstated approval and everything was a go&#34;. Outcome of the event &#34;soreness in muscle on site on injection&#34; was recovering while for coughing was unknown.

                                                Patient vaccinated with first dose of Pfizer with subsequent infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Initial H&amp;P reads in part as,  &#34;Patients symptoms began on or around Thursday 3/11 when he began to feel  fatigued. After two days of fatigue, he presented to an urgent care facility on  Saturday 3/13. He was noted to have a fever there and was diagnosed with a  presumed UTI, though patient reports at bedside that he has not had any  dysuria. He was treated with nitrofurantoin and increased his furosemide  temporarily per urgent care&#39;s recommendations. He then presented to the ER  on 3/15 with continued fatigue and a low blood pressure at home. We were unable  to clarify the method by which the blood pressure measurement was obtained  and/or if it was repeated. Antibiotics were changed to cephalexin at that time  despite a relatively clear UA. His daughter brought him back to the ER today  (3/18) due to persistent issues with low grade fevers in the 100-100.5 range,  significantly worsening fatigue, anorexia, and oxygen levels of 92-93% on  nonproductive cough. Does not have a home O2 requirement. In addition, he  endorses feeling chilled during the admission evaluation. Denies any chest pain,  nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, constipation. # Fever Progression of symptoms from Saturday 3/13 may constitute original presentation  of Covid-19. Presentations on 3/13 and 3/15 with dyspnea and fatigue. Initially  thought to be UTI and was treated with nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. UA on 3/15  in ED was negative for leuk esterase and nitrites. Tested positive for covid-19  on 3/18 with lymphopenia, 90-92% on room air. No home O2 req. Given duration  of symptoms and worsening fatigue and fevers, will admit for treatment of Covid- 19. Also considered CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation as explanations for  dyspnea. Possible CHF exacerbation as well given 1&#43; bilateral pitting edema to  mid-shin and JVD to ear lobe. Suspicion for COPD is low given no report of  increased sputum production and questionable history in chart to begin with.  Would be beneficial to clarify history with collateral history 3/19.&#34;

The patient noted that these symptoms began on day of admission and receiving his vaccine 7 days ago in which he noticed he had increased malaise and increasing DOE/SOB. Patient was noted to be hypoxic with SpO2 in 80s increasing to 90s on 2L NC and in atrial fibrillation on admission. Patient tested positive for COVID-19 on admission and was placed on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 4 days, ceftriaxone 2g qd for 4 days, and doxycycline bid 100mg for 4 days. Patient improved over the 6 day stay until he was stable on room air at rest and upon ambulation at which time he was discharged home on 2/25/2021.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL) from an unspecified date and ongoing for pain from spinal stenosis. The patient went on a 0.5 mile walk everyday in his neighborhood. He got his pain in his back and shoulders after he finished the walk so he took Tylenol. He didn&#39;t take it on a regular basis though. He just took a couple of tablets. The patient got his first injection of the COVID 19 vaccine at 12:15 on 12Jan2021. After he got home , he went online to find out more information on the vaccine. He was originally concerned about having a sore arm, headaches, and all this on Jan2021. He asked about the medication online. It said you can take Tylenol after the vaccine, but do not take it before the vaccine, and that was exactly what he did. He took 2 Tylenol an hour before the vaccine. The doctor was concerned about his age because of his immune system being borderline. That was why he got the vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.
