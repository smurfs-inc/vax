                                                striking headache since receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 07Jan2021 12:45 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included unspecified allergy medication. It was reported that the patient got the COVID-19 Vaccine this morning (07Jan2021 at 12:45 PM). He said he waited 15 minutes after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, until 1:00 pm, and everything seemed to be okay and he had no major problems. On the same day of 07Jan2021, he said he was now having an annoying, striking headache. He described the pain like someone was stabbing him in the head, and then the headache pain goes away.  He said the headache was not constant and only lasts 3-4 seconds. He said the headache has been hitting him every 10-15 minutes. He also mentioned that he takes allergy medication, so it was not unusual for him to have a headache. As treatment, the patient took a loratadine (CLARITIN 24 Hour), and naproxen sodium (ALEVE Liqui-Gel). He said the headache was not getting any worse. He said the headache started slow and was really painful, and then the headache pain lessens up. Outcome of the event was recovering.

It eventually radiated over up into the left quadrant of his chest where he could not push down on it.  It was extremely painful by Monday.  He has a history of esophageal spasms and exacerbated them to where he thought he was having a heart attack.  He called his Cardiologist and told him to go to the ER.  He went to the hospital Monday evening, he had two EKG&#39;s, had blood drawn 3 times, did sonograms looking for blood clots.  He did inform them that he had the vaccine on Friday and they told him it was due to that.  He went to nuclear medicine to get his lung checked for blood clots as well.  All tests were negative.  He saw his PCP today who told him that the lymph nodes were affected due to the vaccine.  He has improved greatly, still has some slight discomfort which his PCP said would go away in time.

                                                On December 30th my father tested positive for COVID.  He was reported asymptomatic by the care facility staff. He was given vaccine on Jan 14th and began feeling ill that evening. The morning of the Jan 15th the nursing facility had my father admitted to emergency and then to ICU. He stayed in the hospital for 10-14 days and then was released on hospice at the senior care facility. He passed away on Jan 31st.  I&#39;m not sure if the sudden change in my father&#39;s health was due or made worse due to the COVID vaccine as the hospital was treating several symptoms,  but the timing seems suspicious. I have also not been able to get an explanation for why he was given a vaccine if he tested positive.  I do not know which vaccine was given, but needed to select one to submit the form.

Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae. The following day a chest tube was inserted and the course of ertapenem completed but vancomycin was continued. By 1/22, patient developed shock liver with ALT/AST 2135/1579 from normal range the day prior and SCr increased to 1.3 from baseline 0.7/cystatin C of 2.46 up from 1.15. Levofloxacin was added for Stenotrophomonas coverage. By 1/25, patient&#39;s clinical status continued to decline and Cardiology was consulted for new onset Afib with RVR. Discussion was documented with patient&#39;s family who requested DNR. Patient passed away in the early AM on 1/26.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9262, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Jan2021 15:30 at a single dose for protection from the virus at the Physician Office. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2011 and ongoing. The patient also thought he had a Covid respiratory infection in Feb2020. He had a prolonged moderate to severe respiratory infection. He thought at first that he had the flu, but he had a flu shot. He thinks he had Covid. He had antibody studies in May2020 (last spring) that were negative. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously had influenza vaccine (flu shot). The patient reported hypothermia after getting the first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. On the same day of vaccination (26Jan2021), he had injection site tenderness. The next day, (27Jan2021), his arm was suddenly painful; he began to have chills 29 hours after receiving the vaccine (27Jan2021) and was shaking. He also had a temperature of 93.7 orally, confirmed with two different digital thermometers. He took his temperature with a new electronic thermometer that he purchased at a pharmacy. His temperature was 92.7 on 27Jan2021. He repeated it with another electronic thermometer. The first evening (27Jan2021), his temperature went to 96.5 to 98 degrees. Then it went down to 93.2 degrees. He covered up with blankets and his temperature increased and the chills stopped. He stated that this was hypothermia. He had low temperatures the following day (28Jan2021) as well, his temperature was 93-94 degrees. His temperature was 93.7 degrees. Other times he checked his temperature and it was 96.5 degrees. When his temperature was low the first time, it only lasted for about three hours. The second time it happened he went to bed and covered up. It lasted for an hour or two. He noticed it again two days ago. The patient also stated the arm he received the injection in was tender however progressed to mild to moderately painful when he experienced the chills and low temperatures. The arm tenderness after getting the vaccine was very mild. He noticed it when he rolled over on his arm. He took some Tylenol for it. His son is an internist. He said the hypothermia was medically significant. His son also said hypothermia is equivalent to a fever in the elderly. The patient wanted to know if there have been any reports of hypothermia after the administration of the vaccine. He has concerns about this occurring after the second dose. He is scheduled to receive the second dose on 15Feb2021 or 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event hypothermia was recovered on 30Jan2021 and pain in arm recovered on 27Jan2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown. The events hypothermia, arm pain and injections site tenderness were assessed as related to BNT16B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported hypothermia and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

This 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EK5730), via an unknown route, on 17Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 78-year-old. The patient was diabetic and hypertensive. Additional medical history included hyperlipidaemia. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. On 18Dec2020, the patient developed severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body. On 19Dec2020, the patient developed achy. On 20Dec2020, the patient was dehydrated and hypotensive, he had also chills.  On unknown date, blood pressure was down to 76/50. His symptoms for COVID were severe achy cramps, hypotension, and dehydration. On 20Dec2020, COVID-19 test was positive. On 21Dec2020, the patient was given monoclonal antibodies.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the lungs was performed on 21Dec2020 and it was ok. A week later (Dec2020), he had a repeat CT which showed increased infiltrates of 10 to 15%. He then started on dexamethasone, apixaban (ELIQUIS) and the rest of the things. He had a repeat CT on 05Jan2021 which showed resolution of the infiltrates; most of the lesions went gone. CT results had improved significantly. The patient underwent a second COVID test a week ago which was still positive. He had a third COVID on 06Jan2021, but results were not available yet. The patient queried if he can proceed with second dose planned on 07Jan2021 or if he should wait. The clinical outcome was recovered for the event &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; on 19Dec2020, for &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39; on 20Dec2020, for &#39;chills&#39; on unknown date in Dec2020, for &#39;achy&#39; on 30Dec2020, for &#39;hypotensive&#39; on 20Dec2020; the outcome of the event &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; was recovering; the outcome for &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39; was unknown.  The reporter considered the events &#39;achy&#39; and &#39;severe achy cramps/severe cramps all over body&#39; serious because causing disability; the events &#39;tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;dehydration/dehydrated&#39;, &#39;chills&#39; and &#39;hypotensive&#39; were considered medically significant.  The reporter considered the events &#39;Tested positive for COVID-19&#39;, &#39;CT showed increased infiltrates 10-15%&#39; and &#39;dehydrated/dehydration&#39; unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  Case will be reassessed when new information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 78-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) intramuscular at single dose at left deltoid on 11Jan2021 around 13:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history was none, he was basically healthy. There were no concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), but the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose exactly 3 weeks before 1st dose on 21Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. The patient began to have muscle pain, chills, and weakness about 8 hours or so after the 2nd vaccine on 11Jan2021. He states these symptoms have maybe gotten a little better, but have been continuing on for 2-3 days now. He is also experiencing perfuse sweating during 13Jan2021night. Right now, he was not experiencing this. Maybe a little bit, but not much. The caller experienced mild tenderness of arm on 12Jan2021: he explained when you press his arm, it hurts a little bit. No events required a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. The outcome of muscle pain was and perfuse sweating was unknown, of chills, weakness was recovering, of mild tenderness of arm was not recovered. The patient was his own primary doctor. The reporter considered all events as medically significant and he believed these symptoms are related to receiving the vaccine because he stated he was okay before that.   No further information expected. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event muscle pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the other events with BNT162b2 can not be completely excluded.

A 78-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 (around 11:00 or 11:30 AM) on left shoulder (arm left) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered at a military facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. He did not receive other vaccines 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient had his 1st dose on 12Jan2021. He was fine that day, but on the 13Jan2021, he woke up and was dizzy. He stated that he had no problem after having the shot, 15 minutes later, he had no problems; but, the next day he began having vertigo and dizziness. Vertigo and dizziness began 13Jan2021 at about 8:00 AM. This has continued the past 3 days. It is getting better, but he is wondering if that is a big problem. At the time of report, it&#39;s getting better but still have it. He asked if he should be concerned. It is quite a bit improved but it&#39;s still there. If he had to drive a car for an emergency, he thinks he could do it, but he wouldn&#39;t volunteer for that right now. He looked up all that stuff and it says that 20% of the people who take it have that. But when they list the side effects, they don&#39;t list dizziness until they list severe that is the only thing that has concerned him. He was scheduled for the 2nd dose on 09Feb2021, longer than the 3weeks. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Lightheadedness; Headache; tightness in his chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EK4176, via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm/ shoulder area on 15Jan2021 at 11:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing epilepsy, patient has epilepsy that has been controlled since 1977; and issues with his blood pressure. He has no allergies. Concomitant medications included phenobarbital and phenytoin (DILANTIN), both for epilepsy. He takes HTZ TRI something, it is a long word but is basically 2 diuretic. He is also being followed by a cardiologist. Patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient got the COVID injection 2.5 hours ago on 15Jan2021 and after that he had a slight case of lightheadedness. He was instructed to drink water and walk if he was able, he did that and it helped. The patient relays that he was fasting that morning and thinks that had some degree of relatedness in the lightheaded feeling. He ate lunch and the light headedness resolved but now he has a slight headache. He was reading the paperwork and on the form under severe reactions, it mentions dizziness, weakness, and difficulty breathing. While he is breath ok, he has noticed a slight degree of tightness in his chest. He did not see this listed but wants to know if this is normal or if it would be related to the difficulty breathing. His main concern is if this is a severe reaction. He had lab work done prior to getting the vaccine, then none afterward. The events did not require visit to emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the event &#39;lightheadedness&#39; was recovered while unknown for the other events.

(His 2nd is scheduled for 3/3) He started with sx ~13 hrs later - He started drifting out of consciousness, then had labored breathing through night rendering him unable to sleep. After getting up in the morning, his breathing was better but he felt lightheaded/weak through the day. By the next morning (Friday 2/12), he was so bad next morning that wife called 911 - He reports that he was there and then not there and was losing track of train of thought. He was taken to ER via EMS, where his HR was initially 15 - He was admitted to hospital - initially a temporary pacer was placed, then a permanent one on Monday, 2/22. He has had other episodes like this in past 13 mos. PCP referred him to neurologist and EENT. Neurology work-up, including MRI and 72 hr EEG were unremarkable, although he learned retrospectively that there was a time during EEG where HR was only 35. EENT found no auditory or other issues . *MD in ER told him that if issues were not neuro in nature, they were probably cardiac.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.

He was lifted back to bed and was reportioned several times because he could not get comfortable.  She went to get him a drink from the kitchen and heard a guttural sound and rushed back to find him unresponsive and blue in color.  She called &#34;911&#34; and patient was dead upon arrival (and a DNR) so the Medical examiner arrived and pronounced him dead.  She states sx started at about 4pm and he was pronounced dead at about 5pm.  Medical examiner determined a heart attack cause of death.  The family not sure that the vaccination had anything to do with death but wanted it to be reported.

An 80-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL1283) , via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 01:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included open heart surgery 11 years ago, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received bnt162b2 yesterday, with no problems. However today (18Jan2021), in 15 minutes after waking up at 11, he had the chills really bad, that went away, then he went to sleep again and woke up and he had all the symptoms on the paperwork, he had dizziness, headache, he&#39;s hardly ever had a headache ever. He had aches and pain. Caller states that he was just asking right now about another company, and their vaccine in started with an M, and her daughter is at a girls home, because she has a epileptic type thing, and this particular shot, that started with M, the nurse called over, and the problems that he is having he explained to the nurse is like when he had the virus previously about in Jul2020, when he had the virus he was in hospital for a week, because he had to get rid of the virus, and they got him out of that. Now he took this shot yesterday and the next day is when he got all these symptoms, he&#39;s tired, cant walk, muscle pain, had chills not any more, pain in the knees, everywhere really, he couldn&#39;t get any position to go back to sleep, his back knees elbow joint pain. Since he had these things, the nurse at the girls home, told his wife if having these problems he can take 300 mg of Zinc, 1000mg of Vitamin C, and 2000IU or Vitamin D, the same thing, that amount, he asks will it over come the symptoms. Another person felt good after getting those, it helped him he does state however that is what the person took when he actually had the Covid 19 Virus. Caller states that he received paperwork after the vaccine from the (State), it has a bunch of blocks asking if he has this or that symptom. His First dose was 17Jan2021 at 1:15, then on 07Feb2021 if this Second Dose. All the side effects started Today 18Jan2021. His doctor said he&#39;s in good health. He did have open heart surgery 11 years ago. The patient reported he is 5 feet 8 and a half inches, he is shrinking. He stated, &#34;I was good until this morning, it hit me like I had the virus. The product they gave me at the (State) was the Pfizer-biontech vaccine. I had all the symptoms except vomiting/throwing up. I got all the other symptoms. no matter which way I turned it was hurting, knees, everything was hurting really bad. I was dizzy and weak so I don&#39;t want to walk around too much. I had muscle pain, joint pain, fever, headaches, chills, never went away. I hurt everywhere. I am really weak. My eyes are hurting. My daughter is in a girls home (paralysis problem). They had the vaccine from the another company and they have heard so many negative stuff so they decided they did not want to, when my wife told her I was having these problems. I had the virus 4 months, the nurse told me to take 300mg of zinc, 1000mg vitamin C and 2000mg vitamin D (the person took that when he had the disease). Should I take this stuff? Is there any information on that? what&#39;s in this? protein? my wife got the disease. They said she had enough antibodies. How long is the immunity? When does it start?&#34; The outcome of the event chills was resolved, of other events was unknown.

Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                Patient is an 80 year old male who has a history of multiple medical problems, including body mass index of 30, hypertension, dyslipidemia, giant-cell arteritis on a slow prednisone taper (currently 2 mg daily), past pulmonary embolism on warfarin, sleep apnea, history of diverticulitis (treated in August 2020), past abdominal surgeries (including umbilical hernia repair ×2 and open recurrent incarcerated epigastric hernia repair with mesh in October 2020), chronic anemia, and type-2 diabetes.  The patient had received the first dose of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine on January 31, 2021 and the second dose on February 21.  He presented to his primary care provider?s office on February 22, 2021 with complaints of 10 days of progressive weakness and muscle soreness.  The weakness had reportedly involved the bilateral thighs and arms and was associated with muscle aches.  Blood pressure measured 90/40 mmHg and examination was notable for symmetrical proximal weakness in the upper and lower extremities.  The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 3.5 x10e3/µL, hemoglobin 8.3 grams per deciliter and platelets 147 x10e3/µL.  A peripheral blood smear was consistent with neutropenia and normocytic anemia with 9% circulating blasts.  Total CK measured 1424 U/L.  The patient was referred to hematology/oncology and rheumatology and had appointment scheduled for both on February 26.    With the above background, he presented to emergency room on February 24 with altered mental status and continued weakness.   He was taken to the hospital by emergency medical services.  A temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit was recorded when emergency medical personnel had arrived. The peripheral blood leukocyte count was 1.4 x10e3/µL for an ANC of 0.8 x10e3/µL.  Hemoglobin was 8.1 g/dL and platelets 111 x10e3/µL.  A few schistocytes and teardrop cells were noted. The serum creatinine was 1.47 mg/dL.  AST was 174, ALT 91 and alkaline phosphatase 93 U/L.  The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.1 mmol per liter.  A repeat total CK was 4631 U/L.  Sedimentation rate measured 34 mm/h and CRP 52.3 mg/L.  Urinalysis showed 0-2 wbc?s/hpf, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, negative leukocyte esterase.  A haptoglobin level of the blood was within normal limits. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 2.0 mmol/L.  LDH measured 838 U/L.  A ferritin level was 3464 nanograms/mL.  A test for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative.     A chest radiograph showed minimal streaky right basilar atelectasis, trace left effusion and a mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette.  A head CT showed no acute abnormality.  An abdominopelvic CT without contrast was limited by motion artifact.  No acute intra-abdominal or pelvic finding was noted.  Nonspecific soft tissue stranding was seen in the right inguinal region.  There was no soft tissue gas or drainable fluid collection.  Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started on empiric cefepime, vancomycin and doxycycline and admitted for further care. A peripheral blood smear for intracellular parasites was negative.  The admission blood cultures came back positive for E. coli. With the blood culture results, the vancomycin and doxycycline were discontinued.  The E. coli isolate has since been determined to be pansusceptible.  A MRSA PCR of the nares was negative.   He was found on exam to have swelling, cellulitis and exquisite pain of the right groin area on February 25.  Surgical consultation was pursued.  They did not feel that he had necrotizing fasciitis.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was repeated with contrast, revealing increased extensive subcutaneous edema of the right groin region with extension into the thigh musculature and mild extension into the right inferior pelvis.  There was no associated soft tissue gas or drainable abscess. A bone marrow biopsy was performed February 25.  Results showed acute undifferentiated leukemia with 60-70% infiltration of the bone marrow with blasts.  The blasts were negative for lineage markers.  He was faintly CD33 positive.  He is felt to likely have acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetics are pending.

The patient previously took trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy. After having a Pfizer shot on Saturday, he had a reaction - dizziness. His wife also received the COVID vaccine but did not have any reaction. He sat in the office for 15 minutes like he was supposed to. He drove home and was fine. Two hours later he was so dizzy he couldn&#39;t stand up. He was holding onto things to walk through the house. That was two hours after he took the vaccine. After that he thought it would go away in a day. All day yesterday, which was the second day, he was still dizzy. If he laid down the bed would float. It was an awful experience. He received the vaccine at 11:45am on 09Jan2021. Two hours later is when it started. He had to hold onto the rail to get up there. If he gets up quick it is still there. He just had blood work and was due back in Apr for check up. He hasn&#39;t had taste and smell for four years or better. He lost his taste and smell and never got it back. He doesn&#39;t know what caused that. He hasn&#39;t been sick. Outcome of the event dizziness was recovering, for the other events was unknown.

                                                My 81-year-old father, and my brother received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at the  Hospital  on Wednesday January 13, 2021. Within a couple of minutes of them returning home, my father collapsed. As it turns out, he&#39;d had a silent heart attack. He is still in the medical center area Hospital this morning. A cardiologist who was filling in for my father&#39;s primary cardiologist thought maybe my father had a blockage and might have needed a stent. But when Dr. performed a cardiac catheterization,  he only found a little plaque. Medical personnel are not too sure what caused the heart attack. My was very dehydrated when he was admitted, and he has underlying health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and a history of blood clots. Those are just a few of his health issues. His primary cardiologist, Dr is back in town. He plans to see if my father has AFib before they release him. I believe Dr. an internist at Hospital,  said my father&#39;s INR on admitting was 1.2. My father&#39;s hematologist, Dr.,  had told us to let the person administering the vaccine know that my father is on blood thinners. I was not present when my father and brother received the vaccine, but I assume my brother passed that information on to them.

Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

The following morning, he woke up early and was still burping and not feeling well.  At around 5:00am, he collapsed.  My mother called 9-1-1 and began giving CPR.  The parademics arrived and tried to revive him, and transported him to the hospital but at 6:11am, he was pronounced dead of a heart attack.  He was healthy.

Medical history included bleeding ulcer and stent put in my heart valve. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) and acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPID-AS [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;CLOPIDOGREL BISULFATE]). On an unspecifed date, the patient&#39;s wife reported that her husband: He&#39;s having some episodes of going on in his head almost like a headache, hard to explain what&#39;s going on. Also nauseous, with the heart specialist told him to take probiotics with his medicine. He was hospitalized on January 7-11. He is on 81mg low dose aspirin, Clopidogrel 75mg daily medication. Prior to that week before Nov2007 he had a reaction to the aspirin and was hospitalized because it gave him a bleeding ulcer. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unspecified date. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 81 y.o. gentleman with a history of smoldering multiple myeloma, urinary retention for which he self catheterizes twice daily, as well as recently diagnosed atrial fibrillation that presents complaining of increasing weakness and falls.  Patient fell 2/18 pm trying to get out of bed and he took about 20 minutes to get himself to a position where he could pull himself back up.  Again 2/19 he was trying to get up and his legs were too weak to carry him and he fell to the ground.  He needed assistance to get up and family asked him to come to emergency room for evaluation.  He has been feeling poorly for about a month, with poor appetite and has lost about 15 pounds.  He is not nauseated or short of breath and has no cough.  He was apparently treated for UTI about 4 to 6 weeks ago after a visit to urgent care.  He has since been to a different urgent care and was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which was new in onset and was referred to a cardiologist who is planning to do a stress test in a few weeks.  I believe he is on Eliquis now.  In ER he was found to have significant pyuria and bacteriuria and was given a dose of Rocephin.  Renal function shows worsening from levels in December although it is pretty stable over the past month from looking through other labs.

Medical history included headache on 26Jan2021. There were no concomitant medications. The reporter stated that her husband (patient) received the first dose of the vaccine about two and one-half to three weeks ago and he had some aches and pain but it was not that bad. She reported that a day or two after the first dose he was achy and didn&#39;t feel like himself.

                                                Developed watery diarrhea; malaise; weight loss; collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). An 81-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included allopurinol (ALLOPURINOL), losartan potassium (COZAAR), tadalafil (TADALAFIL), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN), simvastatin (ZOCOR). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 details: (Product= COVID 19) for covid-19 immunisation, Lot number= EL1284, Administration date= 31Dec2020, administration time= 11:00 AM, vaccine location: Left arm, dose number= 1, Developed watery diarrhea about 5 days after the dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. Adverse event: watery diarrhea improved somewhat but worsened again after the second dose of vaccine, along with some malaise and weight loss, since 05Jan2021. Extensive investigations eventually revealed collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies in Jan2021. May well be coincidence, but interested to know if others have been reported. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Anti-diarrheals, budesonide. The event outcome of collagenous colitis was recovering, watery diarrhea was  not recovered, outcome of other event was unknown. Covid test post vaccination covid test date=19Jan2021, which was negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies and bnt162b2 cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

This morning, he got up at 6am and his temperature was around 98.8; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9261; expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 26Jan2021 at 8:30 to 9 AM, at a single dose, for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history in Mar2020 included had a temperature for 7 days. He tested positive for COVID and it took a while to test negative. At the end of Mar2020 until the first of Apr2020, his temperature was 97 something. He has checked his temperature every day since then. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. He did not receive additional vaccines on the same date bnt162b2 was given. The patient had his first COVID-19 shot yesterday morning about 8:30 or 9:00. He hadn&#39;t really looked at the list of side effects, but yesterday afternoon (26Jan2021), he had slight pain in the arm where the shot was given. If he moved his arm, he would have slight discomfort. The pain was mostly gone today. He also had some slight tenderness in his shoulder, but it&#39;s certainly less than what it was yesterday. He saw other things that were listed including fever. He wanted to know if Pfizer had any information as what to amount of fever people typically experience after having the shot.  Yesterday (unspecified date in Jan2021), his temperature was 97 something. This morning, he got up at 6 am and his temperature was around 98.8. And then he had to take his wife to therapy and when he got back 3 hours later, he took it now and his temperature was 99 degrees. He was just wondering if Pfizer had an idea of how much fever is normal from the shot?  He hasn&#39;t had any other reactions. The events did not require Emergency Room or Physician&#39;s Office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 97 something on 26Jan2021, 98.8 and 99 on 27Jan2021; sars-cov-2 test: positive on an unspecified date in 2020 and negative on an unspecified date in 2020. Outcome of the event &#34;slight pain in his arm the shot was given&#34; was recovering, while for the other events was unknown.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

An 84-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: E18982, expiration date was not reported), intramuscular on the left arm (also reported as left shoulder) on 15Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. It was reported that the patient was taking an unspecified blood thinner and other unspecified products. It was reported that patient got the first dose on 15Jan2021 and everything was fine. The following Friday, exactly a week later, on 22Jan2021 at 930am he got violently sick as far as throwing up and dysentery. He was asking if it could be from the shot. He got sick and was heaving for 7 hours, then he was dry heaving after throwing up so much, it was green bile. He knew he was getting dehydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte at 7pm that night. He had to stay a half hour after getting the vaccine since they wanted to monitor him a little longer since he takes blood thinners an other crap. He did not specify the other medications that he takes. On Saturday he felt fine but he felt weak. The patient recovered from dysentery and throwing up on 23Jan2021, while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

I just feel super weak but not like if you have corona. Now, I can sleep under oxygen and it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore and when I get up I don&#39;t need oxygen anymore and I can breathe freely.&#34; Wanted to know how long will his symptoms last. He was as weak as a rag, has a little fever that comes and goes, does not go over 101, stated he was taking Eliquis does not know if that was important or not, slept with oxygen but has not had any trouble breathing.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

An 87-years-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL3249, intramuscular on left arm on 13Jan2021 (Time the vaccination was given: 13:00-13:15) at the age of  87-years-old at single dose for prevention because of age group.  Medical history included covid-19 in Jun2020, forgetful from an unknown date, he got a little forgetful sometimes, so he may have forgotten to tell her.  This occurred prior to getting the vaccine.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Family medical history was none. The patient got the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week on 13Jan2021, he was really sick in Jan2021. The patient had weak legs anyway, but he got so weak.  Weakness in legs started at night on 13Jan2021, around 20:00. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office required. He never complained of any symptoms and did not know if there were other symptoms, because he did not complain.  He fell on Thursday night on 14Jan2021. He got the vaccine around 1:00-1:15pm, and got so weak, that he went to the bathroom and he fell in the floor.  His legs just continued to get worse.  It started on Wednesday night on 13Jan2021.  He could not walk in Jan2021.  Thursday was the worst. By Friday, it started to get better.  He did not get hospitalized.  He could not get up without help. The patient had Covid 19 in Jun2020. He had a lot of symptoms after receiving the first dose of the vaccine. The reporter reported her father fell in the bathroom while brushing his teeth and her brother had to come over to get him up. The reporter was starting to wonder if he should take the second dose. The outcome of the events Weakness in legs and fell was resolving and of the other events was unknown. The reporter considered event Weakness in legs was serious due to medically significant and disabling; considered event fall was serious due to medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in triggering the onset of the events muscular weakness, fall and gait disturbance cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the elderly patient&#39;s underlying conditions. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

An 88-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 09:45 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for Prevention. Medical history included Type 2 diabetes diagnosed 10 years ago, Quadruple Bypass surgery in 2003, High blood pressure. He was Diabetic, was a heart patient. Before he had his ostomy, he had colitis that causes the patient to bleed when pooping and his guts were ravaged. His stomach might be weakened from having it for years and years in his 30&#39;s, 40&#39;s to early 50&#39;s.  Family medical history included Grandfather died at 42 of bleeding ulcer in his stomach. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. He has allergies to pills but was not taking any.  He does not have a fever.  She has the names of the pills he is allergic to as follows: Simvastatin, Lisinopril, Losartan, Aggrenox cap.  They are listed on his report from (institution name withheld) that he has allergies to. He received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 30Jan2021. There was no prescriber on 30Jan2021 through 01Feb2021, everything was good. On 02Feb2021, that is when his ostomy shot out blood like a faucet when he was taking a shower.  He was changing the bandage that day, he was changing his right sided ileostomy bag and he told her that blood shot out of it &#34;like a faucet.&#34; On 3Feb2021 was nerve wracking, but there was no blood.  He was changing his ostomy pad again on 04Feb2021 and it started bleeding so much that he went to the hospital. He was discharged within a few hours because &#34;they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&#34; He has had colitis for years and has an ileostomy, where they take out a bunch of his colon.  This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.  On 05Feb2021 his ostomy bled a little bit more but it has not bled again since 06Feb2021. She also reports that he feels, &#34; icky, tired, no appetite and achy.&#34; The feeling unwell began on 7Feb2021. That worsened since loss of blood made him weaker and worried.  When he got back from the hospital/ER, he said they were rude.  There was a blizzard.  He checked in around 8pm and they discharged him around 11pm that same night.  ER visit at the institution on 04Feb2021, 8pm to 11pm and released. They performed CT scan abdomen and Pelvis and IV. Results are unknown. Now he was good. The achiness and tiredness was between persistent and worsened. He was worrying now. She took his forehead temperature and it was good on 7Feb2021.  She took everybody&#39;s and they were all good.  He just feels icky and the blood thing is nerve wracking. He is convinced it is coming back. He was not on a blood thinner or anything listed on the vaccine fact sheet. The patient experienced Feeling unwell on 6Feb2021 with outcome of Not Recovered (Feeling unwell was reported as worsened), achy and tired on 5Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, No appetite on 7Feb202108:30  with outcome of Not Recovered, Bleeding out of ileostomy on 2Feb2021 09:45 with outcome of Recovering, Did not sleep on 7Feb2021 21:30  with outcome of Not Recovered. He has a lot of the risk factors; He is Diabetic, is a heart patient, and has high blood pressure, but he really wanted to get the shot. The patient&#39;s primary care provider&#39;s nurse do not believe the bleeding had anything to do with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

                                                he is coughing now; soreness in muscle on site on injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 88-year-old male patient (husband) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL9261, expiry date: May2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 11:30 AM at 0.3 mL, single on left deltoid (reported as &#34;0.3ml by IM (intramuscular) injection once to in left shoulder, the usual place&#34;) for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as &#34;88 and they are not anxious for him to get COVID/he has deep lung disease and if he didn&#39;t get it, he may die from it&#34;).  Vaccination facility type was a special clinic set up by hospital. Vaccine was not administered at facility. Medical history included deep lung disease, total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, asthmatic, lung problems. Patient has no compromised immune system. Patient&#39;s only allergic reaction was old tetanus (tetanus toxoid) but he was really fine. Patient had tetanus toxoid in 1950, he was a very young man and he has not had it since then, the reporter does not believe they give it anymore. No family medical history relevant to adverse events, also reported as &#34;No, but there is no history for the COVID vaccine, we are only 3 months into it&#34;. Concomitant medication included omalizumab (XOLAIR) for lung problems and asthmatic. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer product. After the first 3 days, patient got the vaccine on 23Jan2021. Patient is now on day 9 but the first 3 days after, he had no side effects. On the 4th day (27Jan2021), he developed soreness in his muscle on the site of injection, and the next day it was increasingly sore, on the 28Jan2021, 29Jan2021, 30Jan2021, and was quite incapacitated, he could not use it, it was really bad, now he was beginning to improve. The reporter wanted to Pfizer to know the length and depth. It only had to do with the use of the muscle not, he was not suffering when not using the arm, a couple days were really bad, he did feel it when he was not using it, but most of the time, the pain came when he needed to use it. The reporter talked to enough who said don&#39;t worry, but patient had a total reverse shoulder surgery in Jul2020, in that arm and asked &#34;could that injection exacerbate anything going on there?  Most doctors said to not worry about it&#34;. The reporter wants to help COVID. The reporter got hers minute after his husband and she had no side effects whatsoever, so if there was any question about something going on at the site, she could not imagine hers would be so perfect. The event did not require emergency room and physician office visit, further reported that patient had multiple health issues. Patient was coughing now(01Feb2021), over the years, reporter has learned to deal with many things without going to Urgent Care, ER, patient was 88 and the reporter wanted to keep his husband out due to COVID. The reporter called friends who were medical doctors (MDs), as the reporter was worried, the patient was coming out of it. Patient has one injection, a new medication he was on a biologic. Patient was first refused to get the COVID vaccine due to biologic, and the day before he had received it, so they discussed and decided because of biologic, &#34;XOLAIR&#34;. There were no adverse events prior vaccinations. Patient went on Friday for his next Xolair, he had no problems then. There were no relevant tests and was reported that patient has been there the whole time, at home, has been under quarantine since last Mar2020. If anything threw up a red flag, reporter would think it would be something they would explore, maybe for the Xolair, when this question came up, it was several days before the vaccine, patient was refused. Patient was asked if there were other injections, reporter said that his husband would have &#34;one the one day before&#34;, and they canceled his appointment, and he went to the doctor, the pulmonologist, who administered Xolair, and reporter said that his husband was refused, the doctor said no, &#34;it&#39;s a biologic, he was giving it to patients having the COVID vaccine, there were no interactions, and reinstated approval and everything was a go&#34;. Outcome of the event &#34;soreness in muscle on site on injection&#34; was recovering while for coughing was unknown.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

                                                extremely lightheaded; like he was about to fall down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. This physician reported similar events for 2 patients. This is the 1st of 2 reports.  An 89-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number; EL0140), intramuscular on the right arm on 30Dec2020 10:10 at single dose for vaccination.  Medical history included covid-19 on Jul2020 and had it fairly severe and almost died and he mentions he was overweight.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took flu shot (INFLUENZA VACCINE), a couple of months ago. He mentions he was in the military so he had a lots of shots in his life but he has never had a reaction like this.  The patient stated that on 30Dec2020 10:30, &#34;he became extremely lightheaded, like he was about to fall down. He sat down and is currently sitting down. This lightheadedness started about 20 minutes after the injection. When probed for the outcome, the caller explains it might be improving a little. The lightheadedness is not still not gone, but it has not worsened.  When probed for seriousness criteria, the caller explains he is just resting and sitting. He would say its not serious but it could be medically significant. He states he isn&#39;t sure if this is something that happens to just people who have had COVID before. He states none of his friends or relatives have this type of reaction. He lives in a retirement home and everybody is getting the injection. This is the second day of injections. He doesn&#39;t know if anybody had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine here&#34;. The outcome of the events were recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of lightheadedness and pre-syncope due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2020520862 same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient.

The patient medical history included ongoing dementia (He has a little bit of dementia which has been ongoing since unknown date but at least 10 years) and Maybe some thyroid issues. The patient concomitant medication was not reported. On 27Jan2021, the patient slept most of the day/sleeping more than usual, caregiver tried to have him eat something, but he took one bite said it did not taste quite right and had a running fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. It was reported that patient usually wakes up around 9:00 to 9:30 and read his book but on 27Jan2021 he has been in his chair and slept most of the day, about 3-4 hours until around 14:00 to 14:30. The caregiver gave him some Tylenol and he was reading again with events ongoing and persistent. The reporter enquired whether these events were normal after vaccination because he would have had the symptoms onset closer to the date of vaccination. Therapeutic measures were taken for fever. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3249, expiry date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration (injection) in the left arm on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 89-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient was on unspecified concomitant medications. The patient stated he has been taking the same medications for several years, and he has had no problems with those. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day. The patient had his first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 22Jan2021. He was due for his second shot on 12Feb2021. After he had the first shot, his body got itchy all over and it was still itchy. He also had little tiny pimples on his skin, and it was very uncomfortable. He was wondering if this was a known reaction to the product. He had no idea what to do to relieve the itching. He got the vaccine on 22Jan2021, and the itching started either the next day or two days after getting the vaccine. His body became very itchy, and he was itchy all over. He was developing little red like pimples all different parts of his body; itchy bumps. The itching and pimples having continued through to now, and it seemed to get even more itchy in the evening at bedtime. Last night (unspecified date), he had it on the top of his feet down there, on the top and in between his toes. Those itchy bumps were all over, and he did not know if that was the Pfizer shot.  The patient tried different anti-itch creams on it, and that relieved it for a while, but then it came back. He used clobetasol propionate, but it had not worked. They stopped itch for a while but then it does not help. He tried some just plain anti-itch cream (clarified as Gold Bond Anti-Itch Cream) to stop the itching. It stopped itch for a while, but then it did not help. He did not have to use the cream until 3-4 days. It was some prescription from the doctor, but it was for his wife. He tried it, but it did not do anything. The patient stated the injection itself did not give him any problems. The patient was wondering whether he should take the second shot if this one gave him so much trouble. The clinical outcome of discomfort was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.

He has also reportedly had a cough and some fever.  There has been some report of incontinence of both bowel and bladder.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Wednesday, 3/17.  He and his wife have returned to the home after wintering in another state.  According to his wife, with whom I have spoken this evening, last night he suddenly became confused.  The confusion continued throughout the day today, thus prompting the EMS called to the house and the subsequent journey to the ED for further evaluation.   In the ER this evening, a battery of testing was completed.  A Covid swab is indeed positive.  His wife is uncertain of any positive contacts.  He had some vascular congestion on chest x-ray.  He has a prior history of pleural effusion which is thought to be resolved.  He does have a history of lower extremity edema.  He had some urinary incontinence and his wife held his Lasix Saturday morning.  He was noted to be slightly hypoxic around 88% on room air.  He was around 85% or so on room air at home with their home pulse oximeter device.  He has been placed on 2 L of nasal cannula.
