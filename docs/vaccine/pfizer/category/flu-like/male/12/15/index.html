At 1:37PM, 6 min post receiving vaccine, patient told mom that he felt lightheaded and was having pain at injection site left arm. Rn assessed immediately and pt reported feeling &#34;sick&#34;.  He drank few sips of water. MD called to bedside. I assessed pt at 1:39PM, pt sitting chair, elevated his legs onto the footrests of wheelchair sitting in front of pt.  &#43;Facial and lip pallor,  and   complaining of nausea followed by 1 episode NBNB emesis consisting of what he ate for lunch 1 hour prior. Pt immediately reported feeling better post emesis. Lips appeared pink. Pt brought to triage area, lay supine on stretcher with legs elevated. Nausea and &#34;lightheaded&#34; sensation resolved prior to lying down. BP improved post emesis from 75/39 to 84/46 at 1:48 PM. Stayed lying down for 5 minutes after which time pt wanted to sit up.  Upon sitting BP and HR increased 96/64 and 69, stable with no nausea or lightheadedness, only remaining  sx &#34;slightly weak&#34;. drank 12 oz apple juice and ate 2 graham crackers without any further emesis or symptoms. Observed for 15 more minutes and was ambulating without return of symptoms, discharged home with mom and brother with instructions to seek medical care if symptoms return.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

                                                My son developed a  fever,  brain fog,  and his legs felt like they were burning. More worrisome was the heart pain he woke up with in the middle of the night and throughout the day on 5/20. He complained of a sharp stabbing pain on left side of his chest and said it was hard to take a deep breath. I gave him ibuprofen and he rested. I called his doctor and they said not to worry, these side effects were normal. I?m a bit nervous for him to get the second vaccine  since he had the chest pain side effects as to why I?m reporting this. I?m surprised they give the same dose to a 80lb child, they do to a 200 lb grown man.

The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

At first they were accompanied by hacking cough but then progressed to sharp chest pains at random times especially when lying down.  He has difficulty sleeping and staying asleep. Also, lower abdominal pain but no vowel issues.

                                                After half an hour after i had left the pharmacy after the first dose of Covid Pfizer vaccine, Hamza(12 yrs) started clutching his neck saying its on fire, tears were coming from his eyes and he started choking and coughing. He barely managed to say that his throat felt like something burning hot was pouring down. I immediately gave him cold water to drink. He drank and continued to drink in small sips for the next hour and was feeling normal in an hour. He had not eaten or drank anything after his vaccine. He had also had lunch at 3 pm, a full 2 hours before the vaccine.

                                                The next morning he woke up with arm  hurting him (he couldn&#39;t lift it). He felt a little warm - had a low grade fever -99.something. He had a headache all day. He was very sluggish, tired. He did online school that day. He took a nap and laid down on the couch in between classes. He was really tired. I was giving him Tylenol every four hours. The first time he felt a little better, The second time, it didn&#39;t work. I called the doctor for advice and he told me to give him Children&#39;s Motrin. That seemed to do better. I gave that to him once that day.  The next morning, he felt better. I gave him a Motrin anyway  because he had a light headache. He did say he felt some heart racing. And he was a little tired. He called me from school around 11:30 am and he said that his heart has been racing through the whole morning - he was gym and said  he couldn&#39;t run or anything but his heart was racing. I told him to go to t he school nurse - he had a pulse of 120. I met him there and I called the pediatrician and he saw him at 03:00. His pulse was high but not as high as before. He had rested in between. My son did see a cardiologist in June 2020- they put him on a heart monitor and she couldn&#39;t find anything at that time. At the regular doctor on the 19th, the doctor checked breathing and heart but did not have the materials at that location to do an EKG but said with the lowered heart rate just to watch and if it goes up again to go to Cardiologist we saw in June 2020. He rested some more and it went away on it&#39;s own. After that he was fine and no other issues. In fact, the next day he felt better and was running around and had energy and felt great.

Complained of pain when taking a deep breath and would flinch in pain. By the time got to ER in the afternoon, pain had subsided. Not sure if vaccine related but never had chest pains before &amp; considering report of myocarditis after 2nd shot for younger males. Wanted this documented in case there is a pattern.

The nausea and extreme fatigue persisted  through Saturday and Sunday.  He was only able to keep minimal liquids and food down.  On Sunday afternoon (around 1pm) we had a low grade fever.  This was the first time he was noted to have a fever.  After consulting with telehealth, it was determined that there may be concern about his appendix.  He was admitted to the ER about 5:30pm on Sunday, and was diagnosed with a perforated appendicitis.  An appendectomy was performed at 1am Monday.

Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

He was shivering and sweating. This lasted about 2 hours and then he fell asleep. Today he remembers everything that he said and that happened.

They returned at approximately 5:45 pm, because pt was complaining of a bad headache rating pain 6/10. He denied any other symptoms. We had him sit down in the waiting area and gave him a bottle of water. He started feeling lightheaded a few minutes later and was moved to an exam room. I had him lay down on the exam table. At approx. 5:55pm, I checked his BP while he was laying down and it was 104/62. He reported feeling a little better, so I had him sit up. Rechecked BP and it was 108/70. He reported dizziness had resolved and headache was now 5/10. At some point while I was not with the pt, mom gave him some Aleve, but I don&#39;t know what time. Mom decided to take him home at that point.

                                                Had 2nd Pfizer vaccine at 5:15pm Thursday June 3. Felt fine that evening, just complained arm was starting to hurt when he went to bed around 11pm. Threw up twice on Friday June 4 at 9:30am &amp; 1:30 pm. Very uncomfortable, bad headache, no energy. Mostly slept from 6pm Friday June 4 to 5am Saturday June 5. Immediately threw up when he woke up Friday. Threw up again about 30 min. later and 4 more times during the day. Still having bad head pain. Started to become confused and say things that didn&#39;t make sense. Went to ER around 4:30pm Saturday June 5. Blood work showed his sodium level was dangerously low. He was immediately given sodium and transported to Hospital ICU. Had brain MRI, lumbar puncture and lots of blood work done. Brain MRI showed signs of encephalitis. Also had myocarditis. Was in hospital until Thur. June 10. Encephalitis and myocarditis seemed to resolve quickly and he was just treated with rest and fluids along with antibiotics in case there was any viral/infectious cause of symptoms. All such tests have been negative to date

                                                Patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 6/10/2021. Initially had typical symptoms of fatigue and arm pain. On 6/13/2021, woke up with  central chest pain and &#34;fluttering&#34; of his heart. Mother read the Agency website concerning possible myocarditis after Covid vaccinations so then took him to the ED.  The chest pain lasted about an hour (resolved in triage in the ED). There he had a normal ECG and chest x-ray. He was referred to see me in clinic on 6/15/2021. He had a normal echocardiogram. Due to the parental concern for possible myocarditis, I recommended a troponin which would show if his chest pain were possibly related to that. It returned mildly elevated at 0.21 ng/mL, prompting me to enter this as a possible mild case of myocarditis after vaccination.

He did not throw up but it is now 10:45am on 6/16 and his fever is 102.6 and he is still nauseous.  I&#39;m not too worried since these are all common symptoms but I felt like I should should report them since he is 12 years old.

About 14 hours after revax he had a seizure in the middle of the night, which he reported to his mother the next morning.  He also had fever that next day lasting about 24 hours.  His mother reasoned his seizure was due to fever since his last seizure was 150 days ago and he had been well-controlled on 2 meds.  She presented today for 2nd vaccination, (technically 3rd dose of Pfizer) expressing concerns about another seizure.  She was advised to consult his neurologist,  for guidance and was advised vaccine will be available if/when she and the doctor deem it safe to give.

She requested him to get an IgG Drip because, according to her, any child who has a fever for 7 days might have the virus that causes Kawasaki disease. This is based on her experience with her daughter who has Kawasaki disease. The son was not given the IgG drip because the doctors were not sure. They also tested his stool, but he did not have anything wrong. She mentioned that her son had COVID in October, the one that got sick for a week, then goes away, and comes back again. He was sick for a while with all the symptoms, and it was proven that he had it. Caller states when he got sick, they wanted to rule other things out, so they tested his feces for a bunch of things, but he was negative for everything. As of calling, the son had recovered but she was requesting for him to have an ultrasound of the heart. She was asking if he should get the 2nd dose. The events resulted in physician office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included culture stool negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever, lost weight was recovered on 28May2021; vomiting recovered on 21May2021; diarrhea, fatigue recovered on an unspecified date; and the outcome was unknown for faeces discoloured and illness.

Fever was gone by 48 hours after shot and all other side effect seemed to have subsided by this point.  No mediation was taken by the vaccine recipient.  Vaccine recipient was offered usual foods and he consumed milk and water in smaller amounts than usual but also more frequently than usual to stay hydrated.

A 12-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number Ew0177, on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose in left arm (at the age of 12-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient had no Known allergies. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. The patient had no covid tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication was not reported. The patient had seen his pulmonologist the day before and had a really good check up for his asthma. He had his shot on 14May2021. On 16May2021 he had temp of 102. On early hours of 17May2021 he had major asthma attack. Reporter was very well educated in how to help with an asthma attack. So didnt need to seek medical attention. But it took several nebulizer treatments, couple days a prednisone to get him back to his base line. His temperature lasted a total for 4 days and missed 5 days of school. Reporter did call his pulmonologist for directions on what to do. The outcome of major asthma attack was resolved in 2021. The outcome of temp of 102 was resolved on 20May2021.

                                                The day after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine the patient had a transient tactile fever and headache.  He felt well on 6/17 and went swimming which brought on transient chills and then proceeded to develop midline chest pain.  The chest pain worsened, leading to hospitalization on 6/18 with confirmation of myocarditis on cardiac MRI and with elevated troponin.

                                                My child began feeling tired and ran a temperature about a degree warmer than usual for the first three days after his second COVID vaccine on Sunday 13 June. (So Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday). Thursday he was extra tired and began to complain of itching under the chin in the evening. Friday morning he woke up and had what he described as itchy/painful raised, red patches of skin on his right collarbone, under his chin, across his face (right cheek, temple). His temperature was about 100* and he was, quite frankly, pretty miserable. These weren&#39;t little skin irritations, they were giant patches of inflamed tissue covering the better part of each cheek, his temple, under the chin and then in smaller spots on his collarbones and back. Saturday the rash moved to cover the left side of his face, and the left collarbone. (And no, for the record, I did not switch laundry detergents, change his diet or anything like that.) As of today, 6/21 condition has improved but not fully resolved.

Extenuating headaches after Pfizer vaccine,  seems the vaccine has triggered a  prolonged immune response we have yet been able to stop.  Constant daily headache same area requiring more medication and lasting longer, some days after first does of tylenol he will need a 2nd dose of ibuprofen 4/5 hours later as the headache with first does of pain meds did not remove the headache. , achy pressure pain same with each headache, not sever pain but moderate and affects daily movements and activities as to not escalate the pain further,  drinking multiple bottles of water and trying to stay hydrated along with medications trying to remedy the prolonged headache from the vaccine . Drs have very limited information on how to treat or handle prolonged headaches from vaccination, information on these events or recommended treatments not easily found.

                                                Had the vaccine on Saturday and on Tuesday afternoon, felt very dizzy, became very pale, had chest pain,  pressure in  chest and couldn&#39;t take a deep breath,  vision kept moving in and out, had to sit down, felt very hot and cold at the same time and was actually sweating and feeling chills. Took it easy for the next 4-5 days and just stayed home and in bed. When it got really bad, took a dose of ibuprofen.  The symptoms slowly got better and disappeared. Took about three doses of ibuprofen total over a few days. Talked to our pediatrician a week later who said we should report this.

He had fevers to 101-102 6/17-6/19 that were responsive to antipyretics, then the chest pain started 6/20 and has been constant 5/10 pain since. It is burning and located substernal/between the scapula. Activity/breathing doesn&#39;t worsen the pain, but it is worst at night. He also reports a mild headache today that has since resolved. He went to his PCP today and had an EKG concerning for diffuse precordial ST elevations, so he was referred to the ED with concern for myo/pericarditis.   Of note, Patient received a second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 6/11.  He also travels every week and has removed ticks from himself that were unattached.  No known bites and no rashes.  He has not had any n/v/d, no abdominal pain, no cough/congestion/rhinorrhea, no syncope, no palpitations.   In the ED, he was well-appearing but tachycardic to the 120s with otherwise normal vitals. He developed fever to Tmax 38.3 that improved with Motrin. On exam he had rash concerning for erythema migrans with multiple satellite lesions. He an EKG with ST elevations in the inferolateral leads. POC US did not show any pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted (see consult note) and recommended troponin, which was 1.08, and CRP, which was 7.52.  CXR showed clear lungs and normal cardiac contours.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted for further workup and management of his perimyocarditis. Given his erythema migrans rash and positive history of recent multiple tick exposure, we were concerned about Lyme disease (Lyme antibody pending) and sent testing for co-infection (Anaplasma, Ehrlichiosis) with smear negative for Babesia. We treated him empirically with doxycycline (given antibiotic allergies) and his rash improved. We also considered myocarditis following COVID vaccination. He had serial EKG&#39;s done which showed low-normal function, with EF=55.2%. He had serial troponins sent and they were downtrending at the time of discharge. He had chest pain that improved with PRN ibuprofen. He did not require steroids or IVIG. Cardiac MRI was completed prior to discharge and showed normal function and an area of subepicardial LV myocardial late gadolinium enhancement. consistent with myocarditis. At the time of discharge, he had no chest pain, was eating and drinking normally, and family was in agreement with plan for close Cardiology and Infectious Disease follow-up.

                                                He was ok, when he took his vaccine. He went swimming next week on Tuesday he developed a headache after swimming, I decided to take his BP and temp, his temp was normal and his blood pressure was low his heart rate was fast, it showed an irregular heart beat, I checked it with different monitor just in case it was off and it was the same. After a few days I decided to take him to the clinic and asked them to check if he is having an irregular heartbeat, he was showing low bp and a high heart rate. They sent him to ER they did an EKG, That Dr. sent him home, and the next few days I contacted his pediatrician and oncologist they told me to keep watching and monitoring his bp and heart rate. We saw a cardiologist, they found he doesn&#39;t have a consistent beat he was diagnosed Frequently Ventricular Ectopy.

                                                12 Y 4 M old male with a history of chest pain that started two days ago on Monday. On 7/11 night, he didn&#39;t feel well felt nauseous. He was able to sleep but had chest pain the following morning that improved after he vomited. The chest pain is midsternal and feels pressure-like. It lasted a few hours. He swam on 7/12 without problems (at a swim club) for an hour. He had his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday 7/10/21. There has not been any fevers. Elevated troponin and CRP with recent COVID-19 vaccine, suspicious for post-vaccine myocarditis. He is hemodynamically stable with normal vitals and no evidence of ventricular ectopy or depressed left ventricular function. His troponin peaked at 11.05 and trended down, but his most recent value is slightly up at 8.2 from 7.6. Recommended continuing to trend the troponins for now (if they show a downward trend then twice daily is adequate, unless he develops chest pain). At this time, IVIG is held unless he becomes unstable or  the troponins trend upward .

On July 5th 2021 he woke up with a sore throat and not feeling well, on that night he had a 102&#43; fever, congested and ill. This continued and on Tuesday morning when he woke up, nose red and could not breath out of it. The fever broke on Thursday and he had been treated with Tylenol, Ibuprofen, fluids, Flonase and rest. I tried to help him with steam, to steam out so he could breath better. We did a rapid Covid test on the 6th of July which was negative. On the 9th and 10th he was still tired and had congestion, but on late on the 8th of July the fever did break. He was just miserable, he slept most of that week. He did not have body aches, so I don&#39;t think that he had the flu.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

He hydrated with water that day very well and I gave him 500 mg of Tylenol. On Sunday (2 days after vaccine) we were at church celebrating outdoor Mass. about 20 minutes into church my son said he didn?t feel well and needed water. He was standing at the time he said this. He had been standing under and umbrella the entire time to shade him from the sun. About 1 minute later he fainted. He visually looked very pale at the time. We treated him with by having sit down, moved him to air conditioning. It took about an hour before he felt back to baseline.

                                                At first patient was fine just sore arm.  Approx 2pm the next day we were at Aunt&#39;s house &amp; he became very sleepy and fell asleep outside.  I nudged him to see if he was okay and he couldn&#39;t lift his head up all he said was &#34;I hate you&#34; (he didn&#39;t want the shot and I had a feel well)  I kept nudging him to go inside and he didn&#39;t react.  Finally after 25 min I had my brother in law carry him upstairs.  He didn&#39;t wake up for it (the kid is 13 that never happens).  Every hour I checked on him and he wouldn&#39;t wake up.  I am a nurse do figured the shot made him tired but I did start to get anxious I even sternal rubbed him and he reacted to pain but would not wake up.  Finally around 445 I told my husband we need to make him drink something and I stood him up he would not wake up.  I was trying everything but we got him up enough to gulp down some gatorade.  We put on his sneakers and he basically sleptwalked down the stairs went right to car and fell asleep again.  It was like he was too tired to stay awake.  We got him home and around 515 kept him sitting up in kitchen.  Took him about 20 min to fully open eyes and wake up.    When he was fully awake he said it was like the shot moved from his arm to his whole body when it happened and that was it.  He was sore and achy after that and even today to generalized body.  But he was fine as far as not lethargic after.

He started complaining at 12:22 am on May 15, 2021 (13 hours after vaccine of a slight headache. We did not have Tylenol so gave him 4 chewable aspirins. Shortly after taking the aspirins, i.e. 20 minutes he started having involuntarily muscle tremors in his legs. I gave him 20 ml of Benadryl at 1:04 am and by 1:16 the tremors stopped and he told us that he felt completely fine. He slept soundly after the Benadryl. I think he is allergic to aspirin as he has never had it before.

Vomiting was slowing down. There was no fevers as of yet. He was very tired. He started having abdominal pain. We made an appt with the doctor. The next day, he started having fevers to 101.9. I gave  him Motrin and that brought the fever down. He started food and drinks again. The day after all of his symptoms resolved.

                                                Patient was given the shot at 9:36 am and was asked to sit down for 15 minutes to watch how he reacts with the vaccine. He had been very nervous and anxious before getting the shot because he never had a shot before and was afraid of needle. After around 5 minutes, his dad notified me that his son had upset stomach. I asked the patient if he ate or drank anything in the morning. His dad and he confirmed that he didn&#39;t eat or drink anything (because dad thought that he should not eat anything before getting the shot like getting blood drawn). He confirmed that he breathed okay and didn&#39;t have swelling of lip and throat. His father told me that his son did feel a little bit dizzy and sweating. Since the clinic is full of patients and humidy, I told him and his dad to sit in a room in clinic without patients and bring a fan to the room. After 15 minutes (around 9:51am), after drinking water and eating a banana, all the side effects were gone. He felt better, and he could watch videos/games and have full focus. At 10:24 am (which was more than 30 min resting in clinic), his father and he confirmed that he was feeling better and didn&#39;t have any side effects and decided to leave the clinic and go home.

Immediately, my wife called Telehealth and described the situation. They said to get him some Benadryl and we gave him that. He also had a headache - we might have give him a Tylenol. With Benadryl - he took four or five doses according to the protocol on the Benadryl. He did not go to school. The next day, he was swollen but not as bad. My wife bought him Claritin and he didn&#39;t do anything because he didn&#39;t know which to take (Benadryl or Claritin). His swelling went away quite a bit that day without taking anything and he went back on Wednesday -there was still a little bit of swelling but not much. He wasn&#39;t feeling great though that whole week. He was still tired and was a bit headachy until Friday or so. Somewhere on the weekend he felt back to himself.  He is due for second vaccine this weekend and we aren&#39;t going to have him take it then. We&#39;re concerned and have decided to hold - the physician said he shouldn&#39;t have had a COVID vaccine two weeks before this Pfizer one (he received the Varicella) on the 29th of April- -Dr said  it should have been a month  or so of waiting  still before  he had this vaccine after that.

Seen in my office three times over the next 7-10 days. and symptoms persisted.   Testing included CXR and ECG which were normal.   COVID PCR NP swab was negative and blood work was normal (cbc, ebv/cmv titers, thyroid).  He was evaluated by cardiology on 5/24/21 and diagnosed with POTS.   Currently (early June) he continues to have fatigue significant enough that he can&#39;t get through an entire school day (very atypical for him) and has intermittent pleuritic chest pain (which had mostly resolved about 10 days after the vaccine)   The tachycardia has resolved for the most part (within 2 weeks of the vaccine)

I was called out and I see the boy on the floor . I told him to sit still and rest and not to do anything. I went back in pharmacy to call manager to see if we can get some water for him. I also had someone page mom because mom went shopping. When I went back out to see the boy, his mom was there and he was drinking some water. I came out to talk to mom. while I was there, the boy started to shake and complained of chill. He look pale, so, I went and called 911. They transfer me to the fire department. They said to have him stay where he is and not have anything to eat or drink just incase her may throw up.I told mom.  After that , I went about doing my things . Then emergency came . Then they all left. About 7 pm that day I called mom for follow up and she said he was doing ok.

                                                After second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine he received two days ago on Wednesday June 2nd around 5pm. Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

                                                Small rash developed near his lip; excessive tiredness; he wasnt able to eat.; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (parent, caregiver).  A 13-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s son) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in May2021 about one week ago at 13 years old at 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was a special needs child who was non verbal autistic. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced small rash developed near his lip last Thursday (20May2021) and by the weekend (May2021) he was not able to eat. His mom took him to see hcp and antibiotic cefalexin (CEPHALEXIN) was prescribed which was helping. The patient was having excessive tiredness on May2021 but was unsure if related to covid vaccine. Was it common to have excessive tiredness one week after the covid vaccine? Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of small rash developed near his lip, and he was not able to eat. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The pharmacist told us to walk around the store for 15 minutes. 8 minutes after the vaccine, my son said his arm felt tingly. He immediately began sweating profusely and said that he felt dizzy. I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn&#39;t take anything, he&#39;s active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn&#39;t have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn&#39;t happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn&#39;t had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn&#39;t had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won&#39;t happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021. He had recovered completely from vomiting so far. The patient was released on 26May2021 with a diagnosis of HSP, which was an auto immune response, and he&#39;d never had this happen before. Reporter stated if she googled HSP, it said it can still get worse, but it was not the worst case of HSP. Reporter stated the patient has never had anything like this before, he was perfectly fine, they made it through covid and didn&#39;t get covid and he is a healthy kid so she thought Pfizer should know. The outcome of the events HSP, stomach pain, petechial rash was not recovered. The outcome of vomiting was recovered on 24May2021 or 25May2021. The outcome of the events inflammation in intestines and stomach, didn&#39;t feel well/feel sick, intermittent pain and lower left abdominal pain was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient was examined by his pediatrician and cleared for physical exercise on 06/01/2021; 4 days before receiving his 1st COVID19 shot on 06/05/2021. On 06/07/2021 we dropped patient off at Soccer Camp. At 10am he started basic soccer ball control drills, which did not include rigorous exercise. At 10:30am we received a call from him, asking for us to pick him up as he had almost blacked out a few times.  We arrived at the sports field at 10:40am. I found patient to be red faced, sweaty, but cohesive. He described the following symptoms occurred during mild exercise: difficulty breathing, thirsty, fast heartbeat, &#34;black things&#34; over eyes, preventing clear vision, difficulty focusing, difficulty hearing, feeling faint  He took a water break and used his pro-air inhaler, as he thought he might have been having his 1st asthma attack (he&#39;s only ever presented with slight wheezing or night time cough). After a short break, his symptoms subsided, so he re-joined the group. After one more soccer drill, the symptoms came back again, but this time he experienced very hard palpitations and the feeling that his shoes were squeezing his feet. At that point he asked for permission to call to us and have us collect him.  We took him home and monitored him for a while. He seemed calm and symptom free. I had him shower and he was fine for the rest of the day.  The following day I had him jog on our treadmill for a period. He was symptom free. I increased inclination on the treadmill and he handled it ok without any of the previous symptoms. However, now realizing that he was within the 3 day window of his COVID shot, I decided not take him back to the soccer camp.   As of 06/13/2021 he has not complained of any symptoms returning. That said, he also has not performed any significant outdoor exercise since then either, besides walking.

He has not used his inhaler for over a year. The next day he had hives were much worse and his fever was going up. The hives were worse on his left arm and his arm was red around the vaccination site. He also had swelling in his face and he was having a little trouble breathing. I gave him Benadryl and Zyrtec which helped as well as Pepcid. The breathing difficulty subsided after that. He got a different rash on his back that was different from the original hives. We continued the medications and he was still Febrile until the sixth day. The sore throat is still present after nine days but the fever and hives are gone.

The patient received no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 13Jan2021 at 20:00, 8 hours after getting the shot, the patient experienced tonsils started hurting. He didn&#39;t feel well and had headaches. On 14Jan2021, he had some pretty bad symptoms on Saturday morning, he woke up with herpes zoster on his lips and his mother called to pediatrician and he was very dismissive about it and said that if the body was under stress it can come out, but he never had anything like this before. It looks like little pustules around his mouth and looks like when my mom had shingles. He did mention his arm hurt a little but went to soccer practice. Clarifies the herpes zoster didn&#39;t show up until Saturday evening/night and it was starting to go away. She took son to get Covid PCR testing on 14Jan2021 and it was negative and was told that the herpes zoster was probably a reaction to the vaccine. The patient received treatment with Abreva. The outcome of the events Since the first dose he woke up with what mother states is herpes zoster on his lips was not recovered, and the other event feeling horrible was unknown, and all other events was recovering.   PSCC Communication: PC Filed Product Complaint: Yes, Description of Product Complaint: Description of complaint: Asks if this could be a bad one since he was so sick and took him to get Covid PCR testing and it was negative. Thought was weird since she and her husband both had the Pfizer Covid shot and did not have any reactions. This was son&#39;s first Covid vaccine, Lot number: EW0167, expiry.

                                                Patient received the vaccination and per the mother&#39;s account &#34;seemed tense when he got the shot&#34;. The patient started to walk to the waiting area after receiving the vaccine when he dropped to his knees and reported feeling dizzy. Our physician observers noticed the patient was also sweating and quickly moved him to a stretcher to recover. After a short time of observation (30 min &#43;), the patient was feeling well and sitting up eating and drinking water. According to our physician observers, the patient never lost consciousness and was not injured.

                                                This is a dangerous shot. My son woke up early in the morning in terrible pain and in a cold sweat. This has NEVER happened before! Then he fainted. The next day he was still sick, fainted again and hit his head, needed stitches next to his eye and had a mild concussion from it. He could have been blinded in that eye. This website was a goose chase to get to! There are probably tons of parents who can?t report the adverse reactions their kids are suffering because of how complicated it is to even figure out where to report it. You should be ashamed of this process which lends itself to the under reporting of adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccinations!

                                                On the night of the vaccine, patient developed fever (Tmax 104), chills, and myalgias. He had an outbreak of herpes on his shoulder.  Continued to feel very fatigued. Three days after the vaccine, he started having chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion. He continued to be fatigued. Chest pain was intermittent. Saw pediatric cardiologist at outpatient appointment on 6/15/21 where he had a normal EKG and ECHO.  High sensitivity troponin on 6/15/21 was 0.08. He had a Holter monitor placed. He was asked to do activity while wearing Holter monitor and self-limit based on symptoms. He played basketball that night and had to press the Holter button 8 times while playing when he was experiencing chest pain. When he got home from practice, he felt weak and dizzy with associated chest pain. Mom notes his nails were blue/purple, and he was &#34;lethargic&#34; . Symptoms improved with ibuprofen. Patient did not want to  do usual activity, mom called cardiology who recommended going to ED. Patient has not had chest pain since coming home from practice on 6/15/21.  He was admitted to hospital on 6/16/21. Repeat high sensitivity troponin was 0.82 on 6/16/21 and repeated on 6/17/21 was 0.41. Cardiology consulted. Cardiac MRI performed with normal results. He was dizzy on 6/17/21 when he got up to use the restroom, self-resolved. Cardiology evaluated him and cleared him for discharge with outpatient follow-up and self-limitation with activity.

After four days I called the nurse at his pediatrician and she said kids his age can have fevers longer than adults did, and not to worry if it lasted a week. He ultimately had a fever for nine days, slowly lowering to 99-ish the last few days. He felt relatively fine throughout, only a little tired the first couple of days. I do not consider this a serious reaction (especially as the nurse said not uncommon). He did not see his pediatrician in person. I&#39;m only reporting it bc the VSafe person I talked to said to.

                                                Fever; Dizziness; Headache; Night terrors; Slept all day; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (Patient&#39;s mother). A 13-year-old male patient (reporter son) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0182) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jun2021 16:30 (at the age of 13-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No prior vaccines (4 weeks), no other medical conditions. Reporter Stated, he did not have any other medical conditions besides ADHD. Patient historic vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EW0182) received on 21May2021 at 2:00 PM, administered in left arm via IM (intramuscular) route, and experienced night terrors and fever. On an unspecified date in Jun2021, the patient experienced fever, dizziness, headache, night terrors and slept all day. The patient, on Friday afternoon at 16:30 received his second Pfizer vaccination and he had the most he had common obviously he had the fever the next day, the dizziness, the headache, slept all day, he had the fever all day, around 6:30, he had a really bad night terror and he also had that with the first injection too. Reporter stated, she thought that he just had it with the first injection and that was gonna be it but she didn&#39;t think that he was gonna have the same results with the second injection cause he had it with the first one but he had it a really bad night terrors with the second one as well so he&#39;s pediatrician wanted her to report it again with the second one because his pediatrician hadn&#39;t been seeing that with any other children. She did not know if any other parents had been reporting these. When Probed if the patient was still experiencing these problems, reporter stated that, the symptoms were improved he did not have them since. Reporter Stated, she gave him paracetamol (TYLENOL) for the fever and the headache. It was 200 mg. The outcome of events was reported as recovering.   Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

A few hours later after completing his morning therapies he showered and went to take a nap. At this time he was febrile to 103.6.  At 1600 he had seizure-like activity with trunk and upper extremity shaking as well as eyes rolling back and drooling.  Parents put him in car and transported him to an outside hospital. He did stop seizing prior to getting to that hospital.  Parents reported seizure lasted approximately 15 minutes with no loss of bowel or bladder control.  By time he arrived at local emergency room he was back at his neurological baseline. At the outside hospital our PICU was consulted and he was given ceftriaxone and vancomycin in meningitic dosing.

He woke up the next morning, 6/5/21, complaining that his chest hurt (with a stinging. constant pain), his heart was beating  rapidly, 102.5 degree fever, and he said it was hard to breathe. I gave him 200mg  Ibuprofen and he rested. Symptoms resolved in about 2-3 hours and did not return. I contacted the advice line at, and they set up a video appointment for mid afternoon on that same day, Saturday 6/5. By the time of the visit, symptoms were completely gone. PA recommended he have a Covid test as it was possible those symptoms were from having Covid ( coincidentally and simultaneously). The test was negative.

The patient I was counselling at the register happened to be a nurse.  She reached him first and assessed him for breathing and heart rate. He was not bleeding. We placed him in the recovery position.  The nurse noticed some firemen in the store and called them over. They did a basic assessment, but not a full write up.  After 10-15 minutes, he  felt well enough to sit up.  He remained seated for another 10-15 minutes.  He said his head hurt and was a 4 on a scale of 1-10. I told the patient&#39;s father to monitor his headache and if it gets very bad to seek medical attention.

Patient is a 13 year old male with a history of a neck dislocation who currently presents with 2 days of chest pain after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine. His first vaccine was on June 2, 2021. He tolerated that vaccine well except for some mild left arm pain where he received the vaccine. The second dose was on 6/24/2021 around 3 pm. He felt well that first day, but on 6/25/2021 he started to have achy chest pain when trying to go to sleep. The pain radiated to the left arm and severe. It was worse when lying flat. It prevented him from falling asleep at night. The following day he did okay and went about his normal day. He even was able to play basketball (mostly shooting) and had to play with only his right arm because of pain in the left arm. Last night he again started to feel the achy chest pain with radiation to the left arm thus came to the hospital for evaluation. He states that the pain is associated with chills/sweating, subjective fever, and a cough. Denies any shortness of breath, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, changes in appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, or swelling of extremities/face.

                                                Received vaccine in clinic room.  Eight minutes after receiving COVID-PFE vaccine, patient complained he was ready to go and felt drowsy.  The temperature did seem warm in the clinic room, so I escorted them 30 feet to the lobby.  As the patient passed through the door to the lobby, his gait, he seemed to lose his ability to remain upright and started to collapse.  I was able to catch him prior to hitting the floor.  He never lost consciousness, but we moved him into a clinic room to evaluate and further monitor him.  His blood pressure was a little low initially at 110/50, but came up to 112/60  (closer to his normal) after five to ten minutes.  His pulse was strong and regular.  We gave him a cool, wet compress to the forehead, cool water to drink, and chocolate candy.  He was able to answer questions appropriately.  We monitored him for another 30 minutes before releasing him. His mother was present with him and is a nurse practitioner.  I called the Mom on 6/22/21 (the day after the event).  She (Mom) reports the patient went home, laid down for about 45 minutes, then played video games.    I recommend she considers getting the second dose at either Hospital, so that a higher level of care is available if needed.

                                                myocarditis; fever; ache; lethargy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s grandfather). A 13-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), first single dose and second single dose, both via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) for covid-19 immunisation at age of 13-year-old. Medical history concomitant medications were none. Caller stated that he was inquiring for his 13 years old grandson who was very healthy, active, athletic, on no medications, and with no medical problems. He went on to report that when he received the first dose of the vaccine he had a very strong response to it that included; fever, ache, lethargy, and more. When he had the second dose he had a very similar reaction but worse. He stated that the doctors were thinking that his symptoms could be related to possible myocarditis. The caller explained he was encouraged to call by the pediatrician. The caller reported that his grandson just had his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and with both doses he had, not a terrible one, but a reaction after both doses. His grandson was not on other medications or had any chronic conditions or acute conditions, he was healthy. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about batch/ lot number has been requested.

                                                13 year old who received his second Pfizer COVID vaccine on July 3, 2021 (3 days ago). He describes a low grade fever on the day after the vaccine which did not initially concern him.  He presented to the ER yesterday with complaints of midsternal chest pain and shortness of breath and a vague history of palpitations that started yesterday morning and continued to progress over the day.  The chest pain did not vary with position and was not aggravated with respiratory effort.   He had an elevated troponin and CRP and was admitted for management/observation. His chest pain has resolved since starting Ibuprofen (600 mg q 6 hours).  Serial troponins peaked at 22.9, now trending downward. Notable changes on serial EKG&#39;s with resolving ST segment elevation and T wave inversion. The echocardiogram showed low normal LV function but was otherwise normal.   PT presentation is consistent with the newly recognized post Covid vaccine myocarditis in adolescent males.  Timing of the chest pain in relation to the vaccine, EKG and echo findings and elevated troponins all support the presumed diagnosis of myocarditis.  He met the criteria for a cardiac MRI to be obtained prior to discharge- results pending.

Then his lips and eyes started to swell, his throat got itchy, &amp; he started taking deep breaths. These are telltale signs of him starting to have an anaphylactic reaction. I gave him two Benadryl immediately, and monitored him.  His breathing improved and I didn&#39;t have to inject him with his Epipen or take him to the hospital. The swelling in his eyes and lips didn&#39;t subside, however, so I gave him routine doses of Benadryl for about 12 hours while monitoring him. He was fine again, for another 20 hours or so, and then his symptoms started to come back. Benadryl stopped it completely that time and I didn&#39;t have to give him anymore.

He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

His eyes rolled back in his head, textbook seizure. Lasted a little less than a minute. When came to he said he couldn?t see anything. After about 30 seconds he could start to see. He turned pale, felt like he was going to throw up. But never did. A few minutes later he started to get a little color back in his face. He is tired but was better.

                                                Pt received first shot of Pfizer vaccine on 5/14 - 12:30 PM EST. On 05/17 around 7:45 AM, Pt passed out/fainted. He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

Patient stated that he started to have ringing in the ears and some blurred vision.  Patient&#39;s father instructed patient to lay down on the three chairs in vaccination waiting area.  At this time store employee came out to assist patient and patient&#39;s father.  I (employee) came out to assist moments later when I saw what was happening (I had just finished a consultation with another patient).   We elevated patient&#39;s legs, put and ice pack under his neck, and called 911.  Patient was awake but not very talkative. Patient was very alert and talkative in Clinical Service room at the time of immunization, which was a big change from how he was immediately after fainting. Patient appeared sweaty and pale in color.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was taken at 12:09 pm and was 88/51 pulse 53 (patient was still laying down at this time). Respiration rate was 20 breaths per minute.  At 12:12 pm blood pressure was taken again as patient appeared more responsive and talking more.  His BP was 101/63 and pulse 63.  Immediately after second blood pressure reading, EMS arrived and they took over.  Patient was responsive and drink water and sitting up at this point.  EMS checked patient out and was cleared shortly after.  EMS stated that this will not defer patient from getting his second COVID vaccination.  Before patient left he was continuing to drink water and was eating some crackers.

A few minutes later in the waiting area he started feeling ill and his mom had him sit down and she called 911.  He complained of weakness, diminished sight and hearing and lightheadedness.  He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

After getting the patient to relax, the vaccine was able to be administered. However, patient then became pale, lethargic, and had ringing ears. The patient was sat down and given water while being observed. The pharmacist tried to check his heart rate but without success. EMS was then called for more advanced observation. Patient was recuperating while the EMS was on their way. EMS determined patient might have had an anxiety attack and cleared him after finishing their observations.

                                                My son initially had side effects (tired, hot, sweaty) about 24 hours after receiving his first dose. About 58 hours after the first dose, he started having trouble breathing. He called me in a panic and asked me to come home because he couldn&#39;t breathe. It took me ~15 minutes, and by the time I arrived, he was having some trouble breathing so we took him to the emergency room. They did some tests and sent him home. By that point, the symptoms seemed to have resolved on their own. But then he had some labored breathing later that night.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

He also described visual and tactile disturbances - a sort of hyper awareness as if a precursor to hallucinations - and a racing mind. The shaking and visual and tactile sensations resolved after roughly two hours. He then developed a fever of 100.8, that lasted another 4-5 hours. His symptoms resolved completely within about 14 hours of onset.

The other symptoms resolved but the chest pain persisted. Worse with exertion, and also worse with leaning forward and also lying flat. Went to PCP who drew troponin, which was elevated, sent the pt to the ER. Troponin was elevated in the ER, ECG was normal, echo also normal. Admitted for trending of labs, work up for infectious causes of myocarditis sent. cMRI showed LGE in small area of the inferolateral wall of the LV. Symptoms resolved with Tylenol prior to arrival at the ER, discharged after ~24 hours observation on ibuprofen RTC with close follow-up planned. Restricted from strenuous activity.

                                                The morning after the second dose of the vaccine he woke up and felt hot and my head hurt. He had woken up feeling similar a few times during the night. When he got up he felt really queasy and threw up.  He felt really warm and continued to throw up. With Tylenol the fever was 104 degrees and it continued for several hours even after two doses of Tylenol. I was told to give Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The fever returned to 102 degrees and four later the fever broke. It was almost 10 hours where he was throwing up and the fever fluctuated between 102-104. It is very unusual for him to have any fever.  We continued the Benadryl and Ibuprofen the following day because he still had a low grade fever and some dizziness followed by diarrhea. The dizziness and Diarrhea occurred again the next day three after the vaccine.  It has been five days and he feels better but his stomach is still a little sensitive.  It is possible that he had Covid-19 last year.

                                                14yo male that was admitted to our hospital&#39;s cardiology service prior to after an episode of acute onset tachycardia (possible atrial tachycardia), dizziness, headache at school.  He had his first covid vaccine 8 days prior to the event at school.  He has a coincidental diagnosis of an anomalous left coronary off the right aortic valve cusps, but his coronary course is unusual where he would be very unlikely to be at risk for sudden cardiac arrest.  He had an ECHO in the ED that showed a mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF 45%).  He underwent a cardiac MRI on 5/28/2021 was done that was normal without myocardial edema or scarring.  His ejection fraction on that study (24 hours later) was 54%.  He was discharged home and had a stress test the following week (6/1/2021) that showed blocked PACs at peak exercise (a very usual finding for an otherwise healthy kid) and possible slow atrial tachycardia at baseline.  His laboratory evaluation including CRP and ESR was normal.  72 hour Holter monitor showed blocked PACs and no supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia.  Mother reports that he is &#34;back to baseline&#34; May 31st.    Of note, his father was covid positive with headache in October 2020.  The patient also had a headache for 1 week without fever.  It was presumed that he had covid as well, but was not tested per PCP recommendation.

I reported to the closest worker and she called in another person, assuming one was a nurse and one was not.  She had him look into her eyes, which was difficult, then she had him out his head between his knees for a minute and he was then able to come out of it.  Still a bit dizzy, they moved him to a room with a bed where he could lie down and they put a cold, wet paper towel in his forehead.  He rested there for an additional 10 minutes.  They had him get up and walk before they allowed him to leave.  He had not eaten anything since the night before and he has severe ?needle anxiety ? which both could have contributed to the reaction.  He has not had any issues since, except for a sore arm.

Patient was nervous about getting vaccine.  We called 911, emergency services came, did a work up.  It appeared to be a vagal response, possibly from fear of needles.  When emergency services got patient up he seemed a little nauseous.  They took him to hospital.

                                                He received the second dose of his covid vaccine on 6/7, began to experience sharp chest pain with exertion on 6/11. Pain is central, to the right of the sternum, without radiation. The pain then became more dull, aching, and has been interfering with his sleep. It does seem to be worse when he is thinking about it, better when he is distracted. He went to basketball tryouts 6/15 and the pain has been more frequent since that episode of strenuous exercise. He has not taken anything for the pain. He also notes more frequent fatigue. He denies any prior covid infection. No recent illness or sick contacts. Denies cough, fever, GI upset, diarrhea. He is going to school in-person, they all wear masks.

No fevers or chills.  No cough or cold symptoms. ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST 1 box upsloping elevation V3 through V6.  Initial troponin is elevated at 2.6.  Attempted to consult  cardiologist  and they recommended pediatric cardiology consultation.  Spoke with Dr. .  She recommended admission with trending troponins and Motrin.  She says they typically do echocardiogram and if normal then cardiac MRI.  Spoke with Dr.  in the  ER and they graciously accept patient in transfer.

A 14-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jun2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) on an unspecified date (3 weeks prior on Monday) for covid-19 immunisation. It was reported that his son who was 14 years old got the 2nd dose (Covid vaccine) of Pfizer yesterday around noon. So that was around something 17 hours ago, the reporter don&#39;t receive any information on how to handle any side effect. He apparently has headache and he has fever for 101.5 right now and he has stomach pain. But you said they were not open right now well that this was not very helpful at this point because its 5 eastern time right now. So where could get information on how to handle or what we should do with him to help him. If the reporter could go someplace for reference and couldnot contact at this point in time. Does not seem appropriate and especially giving that you know, you could do on a certain time. So pretty upset with that the reporter known it was recorded one. So, reporter hope someone on side does something about that because it was not very good practice he would try to find answers elsewhere. The outcome of the events were unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed; information abut lot/batch number has been requested

                                                Exactly one week after the 2nd shot, patient was at a track meet and suddenly had a sharp pain in his chest.  It hurt when he inhaled, and he didn&#39;t compete.  He has never experienced this kind of chest pain before.  We thought it was an allergic reaction (hayfever?) because it seemed harder to breathe, so we gave him a benadryl and later went home.  He was tired and took a long nap.  Later he felt better.  But it was scary.  I think he underreported how he felt, to not alarm us parents.  He admits this now. There&#39;s not logical cause other than the vaccine ( no new foods, medications, experiences).  However, he didn&#39;t have any other notable side effects from the 1st or 2nd dose, except tiredness and arm soreness the first days.

                                                Patient was given vaccine with no initial side effects and was asked to wait for 15 minutes before leaving facility.  During that wait time patient started to develop blurred vision, and the pharmacist was alerted that the patient fell on the way to the bathroom.  Patient was then guided into the immunization room when he briefly lost consciousness. While patient was seated, pharmacist assessed for anaphylaxis reaction and contacted emergency services. Blood pressure was taken and noted to be elevated, other symptoms included blurred vision and sweating.  Patient denied itching, swelling, or trouble breathing. Patient did not receive epi-pen and was assessed by emergency services.  Patient recovered shortly after emergency services arrived, no further services were needed

                                                Patient is a previously healthy 15 year-old presenting with chest pain and elevated troponin in the setting of recently receiving his second COVID vaccine.   He was in his USOH and received his second COVID vaccine 6/17. He subsequently experienced tactile fevers, headache, and malaise for two days that resolved. Then 6/21 he developed congestion and chest pain. It is in the center of his chest, not pleuritic but worsened with sneezing/coughing. Tylenol/Motrin help, but given persistence of the pain he presented to the hospital ED.   Lyme titers were sent, troponin at 1814 was 2.12, then at 1646 2.49 (normal &lt;0.06), chem was normal, CBC had wbc 11.5 with 66% neut and Hgb 12.3. EKG and CXR were reportedly normal. He received Tylenol and Ativan and was transferred for further management.   In the ED, he was afebrile with normal VS. Repeat troponin was 0.25. EKG was normal. Given elevated troponin, he is being admitted for further workup and serial cardiac enzymes and EKG.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for troponin and chest pain monitoring. His troponin levels were trended x4 and showed return to normal. Just prior to discharge, troponin level was 0.04 (normal &lt; 0.09). His EKG was normal throughout, and at discharge showed normal sinus rhythm. He did not have any chest pain prior to leaving the hospital. On discharge, he was tolerating a normal diet. Plan for return was discussed with family for cardiac MR on 6/25. Return precautions were discussed and family expressed understanding.

Myself as well as 2 of my technicians checked in on him for  a total of 3 checks. He was waiting for another person to get their vaccination. Upon checking in on the other person (he was still sitting in the waiting area) I asked him how he was feeling. Approximately  25 min had elapsed. He said his throat felt weird like closing. I had him remove his mask immediately. I assisted him to the immunization booth. He was able to walk on his own. I observed him. He said it felt the same maybe a little worse. No other signs of allergic reaction. Technician called 911. He said he was not dizzy and his color was normal. His blood pressure was slightly elevated. He said he had to keep yawning and felt tired and his throat seemed to be getting worse. I administered an epipen and immediately afterwards the paramedics were there. He walked to the stretcher and they took him to the hospital for further evaluation.

I had him sit for monitoring with his family. His parent told me he still felt weird, and that they walked around the store, but now he has a bad headache and feels a little winded. I had him sit in the immunization room with mask off for further monitoring. After a few more minutes, he said it felt like he was suffocating. I administered 1 Epi-Pen at 10:08PM in his left thigh and called an ambulance. Soon after, he was shaking/shivering, but said it was getting easier to breathe. EMT arrived shortly after, noted the hives on his back, and took him to the hospital.

The following morning, he woke up at 5am in tears complaining of extreme heart and chest pain. His breathing was ok. He had a fever (range of 99-101.3) for 2-3 days after each of the doses. I made an appointment with his pediatrician. Dr. exam didn&#39;t find irregularities but he ordered tests to be certain and to rule out the myocarditis being reported. Chest X-Ray and EKG were normal. The Echocardiogram showed mild TR but no other diagnoses. This was patients first echocardiogram, so there was no baseline to compare to.

Day 11 after the vaccine  he complained of chest pain, so I took in to the ED at Hospital. His EKG, CXR, tropinin, CK,BNP were  normal but he was orthostatic by heart rate.  He followed up with Dr. and he recommended push fluids, more salt/Gatorade.  He has continued to have orthostatic tachycardia and when he walks household distances his HR goes up to 120-140. He is lightheaded with minimal exertion. Climbing one flight of stairs makes him short of breath. He has an appointment with Dr. tomorrow, 7-5 and I will request more labs and cardiology referral.  PT was in good shape and played basketball before the vaccine.

                                                Patient reports onset of chest pain three days after his second Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the following three days after his vaccine, he had headache, decreased appetite, and mild nausea. However was still taking in fluids, decreased solid food intake. He also experienced insomnia and generalized malaise. At midnight on 07/02 he began to experience 9/10 substernal chest pain that was sharp, burning in sensation and located in the middle of the chest, non-radiating, pleuritic which lasted for several hours. Patient has had no fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion, sore throat or cough. Denies any  SOB, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, edema, orthopnea. There has been no trauma to the chest. No recent URIs. He was seen at a hospital where he was found to have a trop of 1251 ng/L (converting to ~1.5 in our system) then one hour later up to 1500mg/L. His EKG at the hospital demonstrated lateral ST elevations. Had a normal CXR. He was given Maalox which was not helpful. He was transferred to another medical facility after 3 hours at the hospital.   Upon presentation to the emergency department, his vitals were stable. He had elevated CRP to 7.69, troponin was 1.0. CBC and Chem were normal. BNP normal at 15. Bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted and ECHO showed mild left ventricular dysfunction with EF 47%. Repeat EKG here showed ongoing ST elevations in lateral leads, though mild. His pain has since improved to a 2/10. He has not required any medication for his pain. He is COVID/flu/RSV negative.   On arrival to the floor, his chest pain had completely resolved. Patient reports the pain was pleuritic, worse with exertion and improving on rest.   PMH: idiopathic urticaria  Allergies: NKDA  Family history: none reported, no cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death  Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 2 doses. He initially had some very mild chest discomfort that improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which showed improvement in his EF to 54%. Given his dysfunction, he was started on Enalapril 2.5mg twice daily. He was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional PVCs but no arrhythmias. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.  By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

                                                Likely myocarditis s/p 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine.  From hospital note: Pt was in his usual state of health when he received the second dose of Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  On 6/6, he developed substernal nonradiating chest pain, as well as low-grade temperature to 99.6.  Pain persisted, so he presented to the emergency department on 6/6.  He did not have respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctival injection, new rashes.  In the emergency department he was afebrile with normal vital signs.  Laboratory evaluation in the ED demonstrated WBC 7.45 (N 64, L 19), Hb 14.5, PLT 191, ESR 10, CRP 0.69, AST 46, ALT 14.  BNP 23.  He was noted to have a troponin leak (troponin T 0.55).  Covid PCR and antibody testing were negative.  An EKG demonstrated early repolarization but was otherwise normal.  An echo demonstrated mildly dilated LV with good systolic function. Pt was admitted to the cardiology service for further evaluation and management of myocarditis.  Following admission he remained afebrile with stable vital signs, but continued to have troponin leak.  He was initiated on methylprednisolone 30 mg IV every 12 hours, and IVIG 2g/kg x1.    Pt is a 15 year old with what appears to be myocarditis after the SARS_CoV2, with significant troponin elevation, coming down, chest pain, improved with IVIG and steroids, and ibuprofen prn. Plan for cMRI to look for late gadolinium enhancement to guide course of therapy.

At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

The doctor told me that, he said that he didn&#39;t believe that it was a side effect of a vaccine because it was not, it didn&#39;t developed like within 1 or 4 hours to the vaccine like now when I&#39;ve seen on the news that the inflammation that is happening to some kind on the heart, he matches all the symptoms of that. So I need to know what do I need to make and what do we do for the second dose?&#34; Lab test: They did when he was in the hospital, When he was in the hospital 2 days after they did a bunch of lab test.&#34; Treatment: They did give him some medication in the hospital.

Pfizer is aware of the observations of myocarditis that occurred predominantly in a population of young men who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. There is no evidence at this time to conclude that myocarditis is a risk associated with the use of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Serious adverse events unrelated to, but close in timing to vaccination, are expected to occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. [for non-HCPs]: we refer you to your healthcare provider to discuss this topic. Your healthcare provider knows your medical history, can discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and can provide vaccination  recommendations to you. Pfizer is aware of the reports of myocarditis in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million people globally have now been vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. Serious adverse events unrelated to but close in timing to vaccination will likely occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. With a vast number of people vaccinated to date, the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive. If asked on the specific casesMore specific information on the specific cases or demographics are not currently available to Pfizer Medical Information. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                PT had his first dose of Pfizer vaccine at 5pm on 21st. He looked low energy at night. We felt his forehead and he was warmer than usual. However, thermometer did not show he had a fever. He looked much better in the morning on 22nd. We thought that was it.  Only after a week did PT tell us he had more reaction. However, because he was well then, we did not pay too much attention. When we learned of the link between Covid 19 vaccine and Myocarditis, we asked him in detail again. Here are his responses.  He started feeling his throat hurt when he had dinner that around 7pm. It lasted only that night.  He started feeling chest pain around dinner time too. It only hurt when he moved. That chest pain lasted longer and disappeared on the 23rd.  He started feeling there were air bubbles under his skin on the flat part of his left shoulder (above the injection site and below his neck) on the 22nd. He did not see them. He just felt them. When he pressed them with fingers, he felt them popping. This feeling lasted for a total of three days. He could feel the amount of air bubbles become less over the three days.   We have not seen any side effect in the news like his. We are not sure that he should get his second dose. Please someone could advise us, please send us an email. Much appreciated.

                                                This is a 15 year old male without PMHx  who presents with chest pain for one day after having Pfizer COVID vaccine 2-3 days prior. As per father patient had first dose without any sx except mild soreness on the site of injection. On 6/9/21 he received the second shot of Pfizer vaccine. That day he only fell mild pain on site of infection only. Next day he suffered from chills, HA, and fever. He took Tylenol for it. The day prior admission he had a mild headache and pain on the middle of the chest, dull, not radiating, and on/off. There was one episode of emesis after dinner and after taking TUMS he went to sleep. The parents check on him through the night and upon waking up he complaint still with chest pain, now increased and radiating to left side of the chest. The parents decided to bring him to ED for evaluation where he was found to have elevated troponins and he was admitted for myocarditis likely secondary to the Pfizer vaccine.  His troponins were monitored q8hrs and he was started on Toradol q6hrs. See EKG and Echo results below. Due to increasing troponins 6/13, he was given IVIG with resulting improvement. At this time, we are still monitoring his troponin inpatient with plan for potential cardiac MRI.

                                                Fifteen hours after the vaccine my son woke up and his respiratory rate was high. It was over 140. I woke him up and he had chills and diarrhea. Because of his Cortisol Deficiency I called his doctor. I was advised to give him 30mg Hydrocortisone and lots of water.  His Respiratory and heart rate were high. He was feeling a little short of breath and he had heart palpitations. We went to the ER and they did lots of testing. He had a fever and Sepsis testing. All results were normal and they gave him a Liter of fluids. He was discharged after two hours and his pulse was still high at 105-110. We monitored him and his heart rate was slowing and he started to feel better. His Endocrinologist had him take a double dose of Hydrocortisone the next day. His improvement progressed and by the fourth day the symptoms were gone.  He was able to do his normal activities but tired and worn out from the ordeal. One week later he had a slightly elevated heart rate but it resolved quickly.  He had had a local reaction in his arm with swelling and a rash after the first vaccine.

                                                We sat at the Care facility for approximately 10-15 min. We left facility and my son was saying in the car that he felt very tired and wanted to go home and go to bed.  As soon as we got home, he was walking toward his bedroom and he say &#34;whoa&#34; and then fell to his knees as I caught him and fainted.  He was passed out for a few seconds.  I called 911 immediately  and then he came to and said &#34;what happened&#34;.  Fire Dept. took blood pressure, which was 152/74 and heart rate at 136.  They said his heart rate was fast.  I drove him to ER at and he had a very fast heart rate, around 150 -170.  He was able to go home around 10pm after the negative tests and heart rate coming down to 80-90s for a short time, but still would get high. My son kept saying he felt fine even after passing out and at the ER. He did not feel  like he had a fast heart rate.  ER recommended purchase a pulse oxi meter to test heart rate at home, which I purchased the next day and he&#39;s been in the normal range.  He is scheduled to take the 2nd dose June 18th, but I will not let him get it since he had a severe reaction to the 1st dose.

The skin around the needle puncture &#34;bubbled&#34; up and it caused him pain (more than the 1st dose when he received it). No leakage of vaccine fluid was observed. He had some soreness in the arm. The next day he did develop some nausea, body aches, and slight fever. He is feeling a bit better today (6/14) and only has some nausea remaining. Mom will take him to PCP to evaluate his Left shoulder since it is still achy.

                                                The patient is a 15-year-old male with no past medical history who was in his normal state of health when he received a dose to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on June 10th 2021. The day following vaccine he developed fevers and chills which she treated with Tylenol.  On the morning of June 12 he developed chest pain and nausea which progressively worsened throughout the day.  That day he presented to an outside hospital emergency department where he was found to have elevated troponin and EKG with ST segment elevation.  He was then transferred to the hospital pediatric ICU for further care.  On admission to the PICU treatment was started with IV Toradol.  Echocardiogram was performed and revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function.  His peak troponin level was 27.43.  He remains hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the pediatric floor.  By 6/14/2021 his chest pain had resolved and he continued to improve with NSAID therapy alone.  His troponin down trended to 2.62 on day of discharge.  Repeat echo on day of discharge showed improving but still mildly diminished systolic function.  Repeat ECG at discharge showed persistent ST elevation. He was discharged with a prescription to continue ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily and follow-up with pediatric cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks.

While waiting he was given Gatorade and an ice pack. He laid on the ground and sat back up. Ambulance took his vitals and stated everything was normal. They concluded that he might have been nervous for the vaccine and recommended to follow up with his PCP.

                                                Patient is a healthy 15 year old male presenting with chest pain in the setting of recent SARS-CoV2 vaccination. He was in his usual state of health until he received the second dose of the Pfizer/BNT SARS-CoV2 vaccination on Thursday 6/10. Shortly after and into the following day, he developed fatigue, chills, and a headache, which resolved within 24 hours. However, early this morning at around 2am, he awoke with sharp central chest pain associated with some shortness of breath, radiating to his left, prompting him to present to the ED.  Initially presented to Hospital ED. Vitals stable. Labs notable for troponin 0.07 and d-dimer 1.48. EKG with sinus rhythm, ST elevation in inferior leads. Given ibuprofen 600mg and contacted Cardiology, who recommended transfer to another ED for echocardiogram and further evaluation.  Here in the ED, vital stable, exam non-focal. Labs notable for troponin 0.13 and CRP 3.0; CBC, chem 10, LFTs, BNP, all within normal limits. CXR normal. Echo done which showed normal function (prelim read). Seen by ID who recommended standard workup for vaccine-induced myocarditis. He was admitted to the floor in stable condition.  Hospital Course: Due to rising troponin during hospital day 1 (peak 0.23), patient was treated with IVIG 2 g/kg (6/14) and methylprednisone 30 mg BID (6/14 - 6/15). On 6/15 a cardiac MRI was obtained that showed a small area of late gadolinium enhancement of the LV with normal function.  Troponin was trended every 12 hours and had decreased to 0.11 on 6/15 AM. He was transitioned to oral prednisone 30 mg BID to complete a total steroid course of 5 days (6/14 - 6/18). During admission he was found to be EBV PCR positive with all other viral testing including EBV serologies pending. It is still thought this is likely due to post-vaccine inflammation and not viral myocarditis but serologies should be followed up as outpatient.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  Prednisone for myocarditis  Famotidine for stomach protection while on prednisone  Discharged home with follow up tests scheduled for 6/17/21.

On Tuesday, he started complaining about not remembering what he did the day before when he woke up in the morning..memory started coming back around noon. The memory issues lasted one week and began to dissipate thankfully.  After a few weeks got a call to schedule his second shot.  Called the pediatrician and the pediatrician told us not to administer the second vaccine due to adverse reaction to the first.   We are monitoring his memory issues..he is almost a straight A student in school last year and on an Advanced Learning Plan in high school due to high IQ. We will know if this is long lasting after attending school and monitoring his grades and headaches in the fall.

Rash on lower extremities - serpiginous and lacey most consistent with serum sickness like reaction.  Rash very classic for this, but unclear if flu-like symptoms and fever were typical immunogenic effects of vaccine vs SSLR.  Rash was not itchy and improved overnight prior to clinic presentation on 6/16 (vaccine on 6/14).  Took benadryl x 2.  Patient well in clinic with no residual fever and improved overall.  No treatment given in clinic and no medicine prescribed for home.

                                                Starting from the night of the second day (i.e., June 10th), the patient feels chest pain. The pain also extends to neck and left shoulder. Deep breath aggravates the pain. The patient could not fall asleep. He had a light fever at the night of vaccination day but the fever was gone before the chest pain.  Single lead ECG with Watch has been measured and sent to a friend of the parents&#39; who is a physian, and no abnormal sign was shown from ECG. 400 mg Advil (ibuprofen) was given in the coming morning around 7 AM and the patient was able to fall asleep and symptons were gradually relieved. Another two doses of 200 mg Advil were given with six hours apart on the same day. The pain was gone by the following morning (i.e., June 11th) and no ibuprofen has been given afterwards. We suspect that this is related to myocarditis or pericarditis.  This was the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. There was no symptons for adverse effect after the first dose.

                                                15 yo male with myocarditis following 2nd dose of pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  He reports that he received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 6/16/21. In the 1-2 days following the vaccine he experienced fatigue, body aches, and fever to Tmax 101F. Family treated this with anti-pyretics. On 6/18 he started having a pain in his left chest. He was again febrile at that time. On the day of admission his chest pain was worse and he was experiencing pain all over his body.   He was noted to be tachycardic in the ED. His initial labs showed a modestly elevated BNP to 593 with a markedly elevated troponin to 1233. CRP was mildly elevated at 3.8. Electrolytes were unremarkable as were LFTs. CBC w/ diff showed an absolute lymphopenia with ALC of 1000 but was otherwise unremarkable. D-Dimer was normal. He was admitted initially to hospital medicine and then was transferred to the ICU due to concern for risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia. An echocardiogram done showed trace mitral regurgitation but was otherwise normal with normal LV function. CXR was fairly unremarkable. Coags are normal. Repeat electrolytes showed a slight bump in his creatinine. LFTs largely unchaged and procalcitonin of 0.16.    He does have a past medical history of PCR proven COVID-19 disease in December 2020.

                                                Immediately following the vaccination, the patient told his father he felt dizzy, so he was directed to a chair.  He told his father he could not see anything and was experiencing vertigo.  His father then said his eyes and lips on the left side of his face seemed to be shaking as if he was having a seizure and he lost consciousness for a brief moment.  When he opened his eyes, he told his father he was dizzy and his head hurt, but he could see again.  I brought the patient some water to drink and took his first blood pressure reading at 10:42 am, which read 67/31, pulse 43.  The patient mentioned that he hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day and that he was extremely nervous about getting the vaccination.  His father got some orange juice and started to give him sips of it and he remained seated.  The next blood pressure reading at 10:54 am was 115/59, pulse 76.  The patient said that he was feeling nauseous, but less dizzy.  I gave him two cookies to eat and took his blood pressure again at 11:01 am and it read 117/73, pulse 88.  At this point, the patient said he was feeling much better and the cookies even made the nausea go away.  The final blood pressure reading was at 11:13 am:  122/63, pulse 76.  At this point, the said he felt completely better and father was confident in taking him home, so they left.  I followed up with the father two days later on 6/25/21 and he said that he didn?t have any more problems after they left the store.  That evening, patient&#39;s temperature went up to 99 and his head hurt with movement, but otherwise, he was fine and did not have any more symptoms after that.

                                                6 days after the vaccine, patient reported feeling problematic nasal congestion. We gave him a cetirizine and started him on Flonase. The next day, he reported ongoing symptoms, so he repeated the actions from the day prior. By mid day, he was still feeling puny, so we took him to an urgent care for evaluation. I asked for a PCR COVID nasal swab (which they performed by swabbing both nostrils), and they diagnosed him with a viral illness as he was afebrile. I gave him some Flu and Cold med (acetaminophen, dextromethorphan and phenlyephrine) and checked his temp, which was 100.4F. I left the house for the afternoon and returned hours later. He was laying on the couch, still looking pretty sick. I rechecked his temp and it was 102.3F. He was easily arousable and took fluids, and reported eating a bowl of noodles and drinking a protein shake earlier, so I let him sleep some more. As of writing this form, he has a temp of 103F, still taking fluids easily, intermittently coughing , denies sinus pressure/pain.  I&#39;m still thinking it&#39;s a viral illness, but since he had COVID shot in the past 7 days I thought I&#39;d report this reaction.

                                                15 yo M with no PMH p/w 1 day of chest pain and elevated troponin and lateral ST segment elevations.  On Wednesday 6/30 he had his second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. There after he had headache, tactile fever, fatigue and myalgias which resolved by Friday 7/2. On Friday at midnight, he awoke with 7/10 sharp substernal chest pain, non radiating. No recent trauma to the chest. He took Tylenol at home which did not relieve the pain.  No recent URI sx over the last month. The last time he remembers having URI sx was 1.5 years ago. He does endorse &#34;one or two sneezes&#34; over the past month, which he attributes to allergies.  Today 7/3, he presented to urgent care center where he got an EKG, which was concerning for ST elevations. He was given ASA which did not relieve the pain. He was sent to hospital for further work up where he had a Troponin to 1.59, CRP to 36, AST to 79, ALT to 64, Alkphos to 74, BNP to 119, ESR to 10, and WBC to 13.4.  EKG showed ST elevation in I, II, precordial leads V4 V5 V6. CXR wnl. He was given IV toradol at hospital, which alleviated his CP. He was transferred to ED for further evaluation.  On arrival to the ED on 7/3, he was HDS afebrile, with BP 111/69, HR of 80, and satting 100% on RA. His CP had resolved to a level of 0/10. Additional labs were obtained including repeat CBC (with WBC 10K, Hgb of 14), normal ESR of 20, normal D-dimer of less than 0.27, BMP wnl, elevated LFTs with AST 103, ALT of 61, elevated LDH to 293, normal GGT and alk phos, normal BNP to 28, elevated CRP to 3, and an extremely elevated troponin of 3.15. NP swab for COID, Influenza A/B, and RSV were negative. CXR wnl but did note findings consistent with degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 8 doses. His chest discomfort improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which did not show any cardiac dysfunction. His troponin downtrended while on IV steroids, therefore he was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were continuing to trend down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional NSVTs/PVCs; he was started on Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily to prevent arrhythmias after discharge. He was discharged home with a Holter monitor to be worn for 4 days. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.   Of note, CXR from 7/3 with incidental findings suspicious for degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine. This should be followed  by his primary care physician as an out patient.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily (for prevention of NSVT)  - Prednisone 30mg BID (myocarditis)  - Famotidine 20mg daily (while on steroids)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Cardiac MRI (7/7): ? Normal biventricular size and systolic function. ? No regional wall motion abnormalities. ? Suggestion of increased T2 signal intensity/edema. ? Positive myocardial late gadolinium enhancement without functional correlate. ? No significant valvular dysfunction. ? No coronary artery aneurysms. ? Small pericardial effusion.  Echocardiogram (7/3): ? Normal valvular function. ? Normal left ventricular size and systolic function. ? Normal diastolic function indices. ? Reduced longitudinal strain with normal circumferential strain. ? Normal appearing proximal coronary arteries. ? Qualitatively normal right ventricular systolic function. ? No pericardial effusion present. ? A comprehensive anatomic survey was not performed at this time.

Vaccine was administered at pharmacy.  First dose received on 5/15/2021, second dose on 6/5/2021. Fatigue and chills started a few hours after second dose and then developed shortness of breath, nausea, emesis and 8/10 midsternal chest pain. Presented to an urgent care facility where CXR and EKG were obtained. EKG showed early repolarizations. Labs were obtained at a local ED and showed elevated troponins, initially 11k and then to 20k and peaked there. BNP was within normal limits. Subsequent EKG showed diffuse ST-segment elevations concerning for acute pericarditis. No prior infections or symptoms like this previously. He was given colchicine at outside facility prior to transfer. At hospital he was continued on ibuprofen and monitored with telemetry and had ECHO and cardiac MRI. Latter was consistent with myopericarditis. ECHO showed normal function. He received PPI while on NSAIDs. His symptoms resolved and he was discharged to home on 6/10/2021 with activity restrictions and plan to follow-up with peds cardiology. Of note, there was an error submitting the initial VAERS report for this patient during the admission, therefore, this delayed report is being submitted.

When it was about time for them to leave, he stood up and thats when his mother called for help that he wasnt feeling well. he laid down on the floor for a little bit but then sat back up and sat back on the chair and said he was feeling better. i asked if they wanted us to call 911 and the mom said no. then, the patient said he had to vomit so we asked where he would like to vomit the bathroom is right next to him. patient chose to walk to bathroom and threw up a couple times. patient felt more dizzy/faint in the bathroom so the mother said please call 911 so we did. we sat with patient sitting on a chair for a couple mins and offered little cup of water. tried to talk to the patient and see if he was conscious. patient was responding to questions mom asked in another language. then, the paramedics arrived and put patient on a stretcher and said he seemed ok but was going to take him to hospital just in case. patient was breathing fine and not shaking.

                                                On June 2, 2021, he awoke and complained of feeling hot, tired, and not hungry. His mother had been sick with acute gastroenteritis symptoms 2 days earlier. Over the course of the day, he had a fever to 101.6 F, and began to have loose stools (twice). He received Ibuprofen 400 mg by mouth every 6 hours for the fever, and drank plenty of fluids. On June 3, 2021, he continued to have fevers to 101.5 F, loose stools (twice again), and poor oral intake of food. I canceled his scheduled 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and got him a NP swab test for SARS-CoV-2 through the health department. On June 4, 2021, he had no fever but now complained of a rubbing left parasternal chest pain. On physical examination, his BP was elevated (130s/90s), he had a slight tachycardia (90s), and was afebrile. On auscultation, I heard a S4 gallop and took him immediately to the local ER.
