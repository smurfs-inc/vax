                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

                                                My son developed a  fever,  brain fog,  and his legs felt like they were burning. More worrisome was the heart pain he woke up with in the middle of the night and throughout the day on 5/20. He complained of a sharp stabbing pain on left side of his chest and said it was hard to take a deep breath. I gave him ibuprofen and he rested. I called his doctor and they said not to worry, these side effects were normal. I?m a bit nervous for him to get the second vaccine  since he had the chest pain side effects as to why I?m reporting this. I?m surprised they give the same dose to a 80lb child, they do to a 200 lb grown man.

The cough was accompanied by shortness of breath, given his asthma we assumed this was some asthma related reaction to the vaccine. Nonetheless, that evening he started to complain about chest pain every time he laid back on his bed. This symptom is not common in previous asthma attacks. Sitting up alleviated the symptom, chest pain and shortness of breath lasted for 2 nights (Sunday and Monday evening), by Tuesday he felt better. We assumed this was an asthma episode, but recent reports of Myocarditis leads us to believe the had a mild myocarditis episode, given the chest pain while lying down.  He also had typical COVID vaccine symptoms such as low grade fever (100F), pain in the vaccination site, congestion, and itchy throat.

                                                After half an hour after i had left the pharmacy after the first dose of Covid Pfizer vaccine, Hamza(12 yrs) started clutching his neck saying its on fire, tears were coming from his eyes and he started choking and coughing. He barely managed to say that his throat felt like something burning hot was pouring down. I immediately gave him cold water to drink. He drank and continued to drink in small sips for the next hour and was feeling normal in an hour. He had not eaten or drank anything after his vaccine. He had also had lunch at 3 pm, a full 2 hours before the vaccine.

                                                The next morning he woke up with arm  hurting him (he couldn&#39;t lift it). He felt a little warm - had a low grade fever -99.something. He had a headache all day. He was very sluggish, tired. He did online school that day. He took a nap and laid down on the couch in between classes. He was really tired. I was giving him Tylenol every four hours. The first time he felt a little better, The second time, it didn&#39;t work. I called the doctor for advice and he told me to give him Children&#39;s Motrin. That seemed to do better. I gave that to him once that day.  The next morning, he felt better. I gave him a Motrin anyway  because he had a light headache. He did say he felt some heart racing. And he was a little tired. He called me from school around 11:30 am and he said that his heart has been racing through the whole morning - he was gym and said  he couldn&#39;t run or anything but his heart was racing. I told him to go to t he school nurse - he had a pulse of 120. I met him there and I called the pediatrician and he saw him at 03:00. His pulse was high but not as high as before. He had rested in between. My son did see a cardiologist in June 2020- they put him on a heart monitor and she couldn&#39;t find anything at that time. At the regular doctor on the 19th, the doctor checked breathing and heart but did not have the materials at that location to do an EKG but said with the lowered heart rate just to watch and if it goes up again to go to Cardiologist we saw in June 2020. He rested some more and it went away on it&#39;s own. After that he was fine and no other issues. In fact, the next day he felt better and was running around and had energy and felt great.

Complained of pain when taking a deep breath and would flinch in pain. By the time got to ER in the afternoon, pain had subsided. Not sure if vaccine related but never had chest pains before &amp; considering report of myocarditis after 2nd shot for younger males. Wanted this documented in case there is a pattern.

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

He then walked upstairs in our home and passed out-he was out for around 30 seconds. Afterward, his temp was still 99.9 and he began to experience vertigo. The vertigo lasted until Friday May 21.

                                                Approximately 26 hours after receiving injection (around 6:30 pm on a Friday), he began to vomit and have extreme fatigue.  The nausea and extreme fatigue persisted  through Saturday and Sunday.  He was only able to keep minimal liquids and food down.  On Sunday afternoon (around 1pm) we had a low grade fever.  This was the first time he was noted to have a fever.  After consulting with telehealth, it was determined that there may be concern about his appendix.  He was admitted to the ER about 5:30pm on Sunday, and was diagnosed with a perforated appendicitis.  An appendectomy was performed at 1am Monday.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

They returned at approximately 5:45 pm, because pt was complaining of a bad headache rating pain 6/10. He denied any other symptoms. We had him sit down in the waiting area and gave him a bottle of water. He started feeling lightheaded a few minutes later and was moved to an exam room. I had him lay down on the exam table. At approx. 5:55pm, I checked his BP while he was laying down and it was 104/62. He reported feeling a little better, so I had him sit up. Rechecked BP and it was 108/70. He reported dizziness had resolved and headache was now 5/10. At some point while I was not with the pt, mom gave him some Aleve, but I don&#39;t know what time. Mom decided to take him home at that point.

                                                On 6/6 at 4pm, pt received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. He felt fine that night, but the next day (Monday) woke up with a headache, which was resolved by ibuprofen 200mg. 5 hrs later, headache returned. In total, he took 3 doses of ibuprofen 200 mg that day. On Tuesday, he went on a field trip for school, during which he walked for a total of 40 min. He also went to football practice, where he did weight training and conditioning for 1 hr. He experienced no chest trauma during practice. He tolerated exercise with no dyspnea on exertion and felt perfectly normal, but when he returned home, his mom felt that he appeared unwell and his face and eyes looked swollen. At 9 pm, headache recurred but responded to ibuprofen 200 mg. This morning (Wednesday), he woke up in the early morning complaining of difficulty breathing and orthopnea. Dyspnea was improved by propping head up on more pillows. He also had headache again and received another ibuprofen 200 mg before going to the ED.

He was shivering and sweating. This lasted about 2 hours and then he fell asleep. Today he remembers everything that he said and that happened.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

He hydrated with water that day very well and I gave him 500 mg of Tylenol. On Sunday (2 days after vaccine) we were at church celebrating outdoor Mass. about 20 minutes into church my son said he didn?t feel well and needed water. He was standing at the time he said this. He had been standing under and umbrella the entire time to shade him from the sun. About 1 minute later he fainted. He visually looked very pale at the time. We treated him with by having sit down, moved him to air conditioning. It took about an hour before he felt back to baseline.

Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

                                                Patient took his daily Zyrtec for environmental allergies and that was 4 hours prior to vaccine. He started complaining at 12:22 am on May 15, 2021 (13 hours after vaccine of a slight headache. We did not have Tylenol so gave him 4 chewable aspirins. Shortly after taking the aspirins, i.e. 20 minutes he started having involuntarily muscle tremors in his legs. I gave him 20 ml of Benadryl at 1:04 am and by 1:16 the tremors stopped and he told us that he felt completely fine. He slept soundly after the Benadryl. I think he is allergic to aspirin as he has never had it before.

Slumped over and she caught him and gently brought him to the ground. Mother called out for provider who then came to patient who was laying down on the floor. Patient was able to speak coherently and had no pallor or sweating. He was able to sit up after a couple minutes but stayed sitting as directed on the floor until full 15 minutes had passed. Mother stayed with patient and they were able to leave without any residual side effects from vasovagal response.

                                                At first patient was fine just sore arm.  Approx 2pm the next day we were at Aunt&#39;s house &amp; he became very sleepy and fell asleep outside.  I nudged him to see if he was okay and he couldn&#39;t lift his head up all he said was &#34;I hate you&#34; (he didn&#39;t want the shot and I had a feel well)  I kept nudging him to go inside and he didn&#39;t react.  Finally after 25 min I had my brother in law carry him upstairs.  He didn&#39;t wake up for it (the kid is 13 that never happens).  Every hour I checked on him and he wouldn&#39;t wake up.  I am a nurse do figured the shot made him tired but I did start to get anxious I even sternal rubbed him and he reacted to pain but would not wake up.  Finally around 445 I told my husband we need to make him drink something and I stood him up he would not wake up.  I was trying everything but we got him up enough to gulp down some gatorade.  We put on his sneakers and he basically sleptwalked down the stairs went right to car and fell asleep again.  It was like he was too tired to stay awake.  We got him home and around 515 kept him sitting up in kitchen.  Took him about 20 min to fully open eyes and wake up.    When he was fully awake he said it was like the shot moved from his arm to his whole body when it happened and that was it.  He was sore and achy after that and even today to generalized body.  But he was fine as far as not lethargic after.

                                                He started vomiting just before midnight and he was vomiting violently for about 6 hours. The next morning,  I kept him home. Vomiting was slowing down. There was no fevers as of yet. He was very tired. He started having abdominal pain. We made an appt with the doctor. The next day, he started having fevers to 101.9. I gave  him Motrin and that brought the fever down. He started food and drinks again. The day after all of his symptoms resolved.

                                                Patient was given the shot at 9:36 am and was asked to sit down for 15 minutes to watch how he reacts with the vaccine. He had been very nervous and anxious before getting the shot because he never had a shot before and was afraid of needle. After around 5 minutes, his dad notified me that his son had upset stomach. I asked the patient if he ate or drank anything in the morning. His dad and he confirmed that he didn&#39;t eat or drink anything (because dad thought that he should not eat anything before getting the shot like getting blood drawn). He confirmed that he breathed okay and didn&#39;t have swelling of lip and throat. His father told me that his son did feel a little bit dizzy and sweating. Since the clinic is full of patients and humidy, I told him and his dad to sit in a room in clinic without patients and bring a fan to the room. After 15 minutes (around 9:51am), after drinking water and eating a banana, all the side effects were gone. He felt better, and he could watch videos/games and have full focus. At 10:24 am (which was more than 30 min resting in clinic), his father and he confirmed that he was feeling better and didn&#39;t have any side effects and decided to leave the clinic and go home.

                                                Was fine the night before. Woke up and his eyelids were swollen and his lips were swollen. Immediately, my wife called Telehealth and described the situation. They said to get him some Benadryl and we gave him that. He also had a headache - we might have give him a Tylenol. With Benadryl - he took four or five doses according to the protocol on the Benadryl. He did not go to school. The next day, he was swollen but not as bad. My wife bought him Claritin and he didn&#39;t do anything because he didn&#39;t know which to take (Benadryl or Claritin). His swelling went away quite a bit that day without taking anything and he went back on Wednesday -there was still a little bit of swelling but not much. He wasn&#39;t feeling great though that whole week. He was still tired and was a bit headachy until Friday or so. Somewhere on the weekend he felt back to himself.  He is due for second vaccine this weekend and we aren&#39;t going to have him take it then. We&#39;re concerned and have decided to hold - the physician said he shouldn&#39;t have had a COVID vaccine two weeks before this Pfizer one (he received the Varicella) on the 29th of April- -Dr said  it should have been a month  or so of waiting  still before  he had this vaccine after that.

                                                After getting vaccinated , pt sat in the waiting room for 15 minutes. While sitting he fainted and another customer caught a hold of him. I was called out and I see the boy on the floor . I told him to sit still and rest and not to do anything. I went back in pharmacy to call manager to see if we can get some water for him. I also had someone page mom because mom went shopping. When I went back out to see the boy, his mom was there and he was drinking some water. I came out to talk to mom. while I was there, the boy started to shake and complained of chill. He look pale, so, I went and called 911. They transfer me to the fire department. They said to have him stay where he is and not have anything to eat or drink just incase her may throw up.I told mom.  After that , I went about doing my things . Then emergency came . Then they all left. About 7 pm that day I called mom for follow up and she said he was doing ok.

Felt tired that night and into the next day with some local swelling and pain to the right arm at site of injection, and also into right armpit. Thursday evening, he was resting sitting on the couch and developed some mild chest pain. Can&#39;t really describe the location or severity very well. Did seem to be worse with inspiration. Hasn&#39;t reoccurred since that time. Still feels somewhat tired today with mildly sore right arm. No fevers. No chest pain today.    IR showed second dose of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was given to the left arm but confirmed with CVS that it was given to the right arm.

                                                Small rash developed near his lip; excessive tiredness; he wasnt able to eat.; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (parent, caregiver).  A 13-year-old male patient (reporter&#39;s son) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in May2021 about one week ago at 13 years old at 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was a special needs child who was non verbal autistic. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced small rash developed near his lip last Thursday (20May2021) and by the weekend (May2021) he was not able to eat. His mom took him to see hcp and antibiotic cefalexin (CEPHALEXIN) was prescribed which was helping. The patient was having excessive tiredness on May2021 but was unsure if related to covid vaccine. Was it common to have excessive tiredness one week after the covid vaccine? Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of small rash developed near his lip, and he was not able to eat. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine, my son felt totally fine. The pharmacist told us to walk around the store for 15 minutes. 8 minutes after the vaccine, my son said his arm felt tingly. He immediately began sweating profusely and said that he felt dizzy. I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

                                                Fever - up to 102 - lasted until yesterday - it was back down to normal yesterday. He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

                                                inflammation in his intestines and his stomach; petechial rash on his legs, which is still getting a little bit worse; HSP; stomach pain/extreme stomach pain started again and so on/intermittent stomach pain/lower left abdominal pain; lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting; Caller states again he had intermittent pain throughout the day; vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting; didn&#39;t feel well/feel sick again; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s parent). A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn&#39;t take anything, he&#39;s active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn&#39;t have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn&#39;t happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn&#39;t had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn&#39;t had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won&#39;t happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021. He had recovered completely from vomiting so far. The patient was released on 26May2021 with a diagnosis of HSP, which was an auto immune response, and he&#39;d never had this happen before. Reporter stated if she googled HSP, it said it can still get worse, but it was not the worst case of HSP. Reporter stated the patient has never had anything like this before, he was perfectly fine, they made it through covid and didn&#39;t get covid and he is a healthy kid so she thought Pfizer should know. The outcome of the events HSP, stomach pain, petechial rash was not recovered. The outcome of vomiting was recovered on 24May2021 or 25May2021. The outcome of the events inflammation in intestines and stomach, didn&#39;t feel well/feel sick, intermittent pain and lower left abdominal pain was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

Throughout the day, I had moderate fatigue. Also, I had nausea, dizziness, chills, and a feverish feeling (all symptoms were wild). That night, I ate a light, protein-filled meal, 325 mg of Tylenol, laid down for a while, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I feel perfect and had no symptoms.

                                                Pt received first shot of Pfizer vaccine on 5/14 - 12:30 PM EST. On 05/17 around 7:45 AM, Pt passed out/fainted. He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

Patient stated that he started to have ringing in the ears and some blurred vision.  Patient&#39;s father instructed patient to lay down on the three chairs in vaccination waiting area.  At this time store employee came out to assist patient and patient&#39;s father.  I (employee) came out to assist moments later when I saw what was happening (I had just finished a consultation with another patient).   We elevated patient&#39;s legs, put and ice pack under his neck, and called 911.  Patient was awake but not very talkative. Patient was very alert and talkative in Clinical Service room at the time of immunization, which was a big change from how he was immediately after fainting. Patient appeared sweaty and pale in color.  Patient&#39;s blood pressure was taken at 12:09 pm and was 88/51 pulse 53 (patient was still laying down at this time). Respiration rate was 20 breaths per minute.  At 12:12 pm blood pressure was taken again as patient appeared more responsive and talking more.  His BP was 101/63 and pulse 63.  Immediately after second blood pressure reading, EMS arrived and they took over.  Patient was responsive and drink water and sitting up at this point.  EMS checked patient out and was cleared shortly after.  EMS stated that this will not defer patient from getting his second COVID vaccination.  Before patient left he was continuing to drink water and was eating some crackers.

She had been giving him peptobismol, thinking it was gas related pain. However, due to him persistently complaining of the pain after eating, she brought him to. She denied any fever, shortness of breath, weakness/fatigue. Of note, mother had COVID in march 2020 and she believed he might have been sick around that time as well.  Patient is still in the hospital and continues to receive pain medication and treatment for myocarditis  (NSAIDS and opioids)

A few minutes later in the waiting area he started feeling ill and his mom had him sit down and she called 911.  He complained of weakness, diminished sight and hearing and lightheadedness.  He was very pale and sweaty.  With his mom&#39;s permission I activated an ammonia inhalant near his nose.  He said he felt better after the 2nd sniff.  After a couple minutes he said his symptoms were greatly diminished and he was ok.  The paramedics arrived and pt was able to walk to the ambulance for further evaluation.  A paramedic came back and said the patient is feeling much better and declined to go to the hospital.  I talked to the mom a couple hours later and she said he is all better.

After getting the patient to relax, the vaccine was able to be administered. However, patient then became pale, lethargic, and had ringing ears. The patient was sat down and given water while being observed. The pharmacist tried to check his heart rate but without success. EMS was then called for more advanced observation. Patient was recuperating while the EMS was on their way. EMS determined patient might have had an anxiety attack and cleared him after finishing their observations.

About 58 hours after the first dose, he started having trouble breathing. He called me in a panic and asked me to come home because he couldn&#39;t breathe. It took me ~15 minutes, and by the time I arrived, he was having some trouble breathing so we took him to the emergency room. They did some tests and sent him home. By that point, the symptoms seemed to have resolved on their own. But then he had some labored breathing later that night.

After a little while, he got up and was able to take some Tylenol and attend his video school day with frequent breaks. In afternoon, he started to feel worse. 102. 6 fever - we called Tele-doc appt. His throat was sore and he had some chest pain. The doctor recommended that we go to ER to have him fully evaluated. Pain and fever got better with the Tylenol. He took another couple of dose. Next morning, he had a lot better but continued to have a low fever 100.2 - on and off that day. His lymph nodes under his left arm were quite swollen and painful. The fever did not continue yesterday but the swelling has and the pain has. He was very light-headed and brain fogged on Sunday and Monday. Seems to be better today - the lymph nodes have gone down a lot but are still swollen today. He is  in process of recovering.

He also described visual and tactile disturbances - a sort of hyper awareness as if a precursor to hallucinations - and a racing mind. The shaking and visual and tactile sensations resolved after roughly two hours. He then developed a fever of 100.8, that lasted another 4-5 hours. His symptoms resolved completely within about 14 hours of onset.

                                                The morning after the second dose of the vaccine he woke up and felt hot and my head hurt. He had woken up feeling similar a few times during the night. When he got up he felt really queasy and threw up.  He felt really warm and continued to throw up. With Tylenol the fever was 104 degrees and it continued for several hours even after two doses of Tylenol. I was told to give Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The fever returned to 102 degrees and four later the fever broke. It was almost 10 hours where he was throwing up and the fever fluctuated between 102-104. It is very unusual for him to have any fever.  We continued the Benadryl and Ibuprofen the following day because he still had a low grade fever and some dizziness followed by diarrhea. The dizziness and Diarrhea occurred again the next day three after the vaccine.  It has been five days and he feels better but his stomach is still a little sensitive.  It is possible that he had Covid-19 last year.

                                                14yo male that was admitted to our hospital&#39;s cardiology service prior to after an episode of acute onset tachycardia (possible atrial tachycardia), dizziness, headache at school.  He had his first covid vaccine 8 days prior to the event at school.  He has a coincidental diagnosis of an anomalous left coronary off the right aortic valve cusps, but his coronary course is unusual where he would be very unlikely to be at risk for sudden cardiac arrest.  He had an ECHO in the ED that showed a mild left ventricular dysfunction (EF 45%).  He underwent a cardiac MRI on 5/28/2021 was done that was normal without myocardial edema or scarring.  His ejection fraction on that study (24 hours later) was 54%.  He was discharged home and had a stress test the following week (6/1/2021) that showed blocked PACs at peak exercise (a very usual finding for an otherwise healthy kid) and possible slow atrial tachycardia at baseline.  His laboratory evaluation including CRP and ESR was normal.  72 hour Holter monitor showed blocked PACs and no supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia.  Mother reports that he is &#34;back to baseline&#34; May 31st.    Of note, his father was covid positive with headache in October 2020.  The patient also had a headache for 1 week without fever.  It was presumed that he had covid as well, but was not tested per PCP recommendation.

I reported to the closest worker and she called in another person, assuming one was a nurse and one was not.  She had him look into her eyes, which was difficult, then she had him out his head between his knees for a minute and he was then able to come out of it.  Still a bit dizzy, they moved him to a room with a bed where he could lie down and they put a cold, wet paper towel in his forehead.  He rested there for an additional 10 minutes.  They had him get up and walk before they allowed him to leave.  He had not eaten anything since the night before and he has severe ?needle anxiety ? which both could have contributed to the reaction.  He has not had any issues since, except for a sore arm.

About 7 minutes into waiting, my son said he was thirsty and not feeling that good.  we started to walk to get a water and he totally blacked out and exhibited mild like seizure activity.  After he &#34;came too&#34;, he complained of blurry vision and still didn&#39;t feel good as we waited for ambulance.  Once ambulance came he was feeling a little better.  Vitals all checked out good and were declined going to hospital.  He doesn&#39;t remember anything that happened in Pharmacy, except that he thought he was going to die.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

He got sick first and then his little brother followed and then I got sick - we were all sick about the same amount of time - 5- 7 days. His Dad got his second shot at the same time as patient got his first shot. I had been fully vaccinated by that time.

                                                Likely myocarditis s/p 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine.  From hospital note: Pt was in his usual state of health when he received the second dose of Pfizer mRNA Covid vaccine on 6/3.  On 6/6, he developed substernal nonradiating chest pain, as well as low-grade temperature to 99.6.  Pain persisted, so he presented to the emergency department on 6/6.  He did not have respiratory symptoms, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctival injection, new rashes.  In the emergency department he was afebrile with normal vital signs.  Laboratory evaluation in the ED demonstrated WBC 7.45 (N 64, L 19), Hb 14.5, PLT 191, ESR 10, CRP 0.69, AST 46, ALT 14.  BNP 23.  He was noted to have a troponin leak (troponin T 0.55).  Covid PCR and antibody testing were negative.  An EKG demonstrated early repolarization but was otherwise normal.  An echo demonstrated mildly dilated LV with good systolic function. Pt was admitted to the cardiology service for further evaluation and management of myocarditis.  Following admission he remained afebrile with stable vital signs, but continued to have troponin leak.  He was initiated on methylprednisolone 30 mg IV every 12 hours, and IVIG 2g/kg x1.    Pt is a 15 year old with what appears to be myocarditis after the SARS_CoV2, with significant troponin elevation, coming down, chest pain, improved with IVIG and steroids, and ibuprofen prn. Plan for cMRI to look for late gadolinium enhancement to guide course of therapy.

At 1:00am on 6/8/21 he was struggling to breathe due to pain in the center of his chest upon inhalation. Nothing like this has ever happened to him before. His chest pain was worse lying down and he could not lie down or sleep and wanted to stay standing on his feet. He felt pain in both forearms too. He was crying from the pain and the difficulty of breathing, and was very tired but unable to recline in order to sleep. I called the advice nurse, who checked with the doctor on call at his pediatrician?s office, and she told us to go to the ER due to concern it may be myocarditis or pericarditis.

Pfizer is aware of the observations of myocarditis that occurred predominantly in a population of young men who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse events are regularly and thoroughly reviewed and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. There is no evidence at this time to conclude that myocarditis is a risk associated with the use of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been administered globally. Serious adverse events unrelated to, but close in timing to vaccination, are expected to occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. [for non-HCPs]: we refer you to your healthcare provider to discuss this topic. Your healthcare provider knows your medical history, can discuss the risks and benefits of the vaccine, and can provide vaccination  recommendations to you. Pfizer is aware of the reports of myocarditis in recipients of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. More than 260 million people globally have now been vaccinated with the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and we have not observed a higher rate of myocarditis than what would be expected in the general population. A causal link to the vaccine has not been established. Serious adverse events unrelated to but close in timing to vaccination will likely occur at a similar rate in vaccinated individuals as they would in the overall population. With a vast number of people vaccinated to date, the benefit risk profile of our vaccine remains positive. If asked on the specific casesMore specific information on the specific cases or demographics are not currently available to Pfizer Medical Information. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.
