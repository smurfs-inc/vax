A 90-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included none. Patient just took his regular medications. Caller said that he had his vaccine done on 30Dec2020 and two days ago (15Jan2021) he started to get pain in the back of his neck going up towards his head. He has had no other problems. It could be he had been sitting too long from watching TV most of the day. But he wanted to mention this. It started a little bit on Friday 15Jan2021, then a lot on Saturday 16Jan2021, and then today it started to go up towards his head. When he bended down more and moved around it would go away for a while, then come back. He would move it back and fourth and down and up. Then it would feel good. But then if he touched it, he can feel the pain. He thought it would get better. This was his first dose. He will get his second dose on 30Jun2021. Outcome of pain in the back of his neck going up towards his head was not recovered.

His oxygen levels decreased and his blood work showed low platelets, so he was admitted to hospital on March22-23.  Discharged with recommendations to see hematologist.  Bone marrow biopsy indicated a very rare form of leukemia (Hairy Cell ).  Cancer likely not a cause of vaccine of course, but suspected low blood platelets and exacerbation of COPD?

A 92-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3246, expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 am (at the age of 92-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in other type vaccination facility: park. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported. There was no history of any previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were no other additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On an unknown date in 2021 patient experienced dizziness, weakness, tiredness, was sleepy, lightheadedness, unstable feeling. On 30Jan2021 patient had shoulder pain (arthralgia). It was reported that patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine 9 days ago. However, he said he was still experiencing mild tiredness, weakness, and dizziness. He wants to know if these side effects are still associated to the vaccine and if it is normal that he is still experiencing it 9 days after his 1st dose. He also mentioned that he has no temperature and his pulse and blood pressure was normal. It was then reported that patient was still suffering some side effects 2-1/2 weeks after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said the side effects come and go. He said the side effects will last 4-5 hours, and then go away, and come back the next day. He said he has checked his blood pressure and pulse, and they are both OK. He said he uses an oximeter to check his oxygen level, and his oxygen is good. He said he sleeps well at night. He said he is having periods of dizziness, weakness, and feeling tired and sleepy. He said he feels lightheaded and unstable on his feet, also. He said he feels fine now. He said his right shoulder is bothering him a little, too. He said his right shoulder was uncomfortable and bothered him if he laid on it at night. Reported his back was bothering him, so he bent over a little, but if he stands up straight, he was about 5&#39;10&#34;. He stated his side effects started a day or so after he received his COVID-19 Vaccine, and he can&#39;t remember the exact day. He said the side effects lasted continuously for several days, or about a week. He said now his side effects are sporadic. He said in the morning he will wake up and feel OK, and then after a while the side effects start. He said some days his side effects will start in the morning, and other days his side effects won&#39;t start until the afternoon. Patient declined any treatment. He said he read that any side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine only last 2-3 days. Reporter wants to know if it is a problem that he is still having side effects after 2-1/2 weeks or is there some action he should be taking. He said he figured Pfizer is the expert, so he would ask Pfizer directly. He said otherwise, he was thinking of going to an urgent care to see what the urgent care thinks of his side effects. There was no emergency room or physician office visit. There were no relevant tests. Reported his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose was scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:30AM and asked if still can get the 2nd dose Vaccine after having a reaction to the 1st dose. No PQC was present.

He was at therapy from 12:36 pm until 1:22 pm when he stated he was too tired and could not do anymore. The therapist took him back to his room at that time and he got into bed himself but stated his legs felt heavy. At 1:50 pm the CNA answered his call light and found he had taken himself to the bathroom. She stated that when he went to get back into the bed it was &#34;abnormal&#34; how he was getting into it so she assisted him. At that time he quit breathing and she called a RN into the room immediately. He was found without a pulse, respirations, or blood pressure at 1:54 pm. He was a DNR.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

I spoke with him the evening before (on 1/14), which was a day after he had received the Covid vaccine. He was not having any symptoms of allergy or reaction then. He did say that he felt tired, but he often complained of feeling tired over time.

                                                I received  my first COVID 19 Pfizer Vaccination on Jan. 21, 2021 from clinic about 2:30 pm. I am age 94.  My wife brought me home about 3:30 pm and I was tired and went to bed and to sleep. I slept soundly until about 8 pm, and my wife awoke me to eat.  I was too weak to sit up or stand, my legs felt like rubber.  I didn?t feel like eating, and I couldn?t answer her questions coherently.  My wife was worried and called the 911. They checked me and found my vital signs were normal, so they helped my wife get me settled in bed. The next few days I still felt weak and had to use a cane or walker.  My second dose is scheduled for February 11, 2021 at 2 pm.  Will I likely have worse side affects?  What precautions should I take.

A 95-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient has a hearing and memory problem. He later clarified the main thing is he wanted to know if he can continue with getting the second COVID vaccination. He wanted to continue but wanted to know if these symptoms will prevent him from continuing with getting the COVID vaccination. He confirmed he has no problems around the injection site. However, this is the second day and in Jan2021, he had dizziness. On 11Jan2021, last night he had a very bad headache and fatigue. This morning he is feeling better, but he still has slight dizziness. He is still three weeks away from getting the next vaccine. He wanted to know if he would be able to still take it. He wanted to be immune and to know if there would be any reason why he cannot take the second dose of the vaccine. He then mentioned these symptoms that he is speaking of are general symptoms and he assumed other people have reported them along with him because it is listed on the information sheet. Outcome of the events of dizziness, fatigue and headache was recovering, other events was unknown.    Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

A 95-year-old male patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine ), via an unspecified route of administration in upper right arm on 16Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for vaccination. Medical history included diabetes from 1950 (also reported as 1991) and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications.

Further clarified this event as to include injection site pain; tiredness; muscle pain; feeling unwell; frequent urination every 15 minutes; signs of severe allergic reaction including dizziness, weakness and sight impairment. Patient clarified that all of these events had onset of about 12:00pm-1 hour after Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered (16Jan2021 12:00) and had for the most part remained the same since onset, but for sight impairment was on 18Jan2021. The patient did not see very well; caller had to read some of the information provided in this report from forms that patient was unable to read during report. The muscle pain was marginal. The weakness was the same or worse. He wanted a pain reliver or pill. Patient did not plan to get the second dose due to adverse events. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No emergency room/physician office visit. Family medical history relevant to the events was none. The outcome of injection site pain was recovered on 18Jan2021, tiredness, feeling unwell, dizziness was not recovered, muscle pain, frequent urination every 15 minutes was recovering, severe allergic reaction, weakness, sight impairment was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
