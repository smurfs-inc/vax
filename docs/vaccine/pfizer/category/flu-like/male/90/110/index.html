After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

A 95-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On an unspecified date, the patient has a hearing and memory problem. He later clarified the main thing is he wanted to know if he can continue with getting the second COVID vaccination. He wanted to continue but wanted to know if these symptoms will prevent him from continuing with getting the COVID vaccination. He confirmed he has no problems around the injection site. However, this is the second day and in Jan2021, he had dizziness. On 11Jan2021, last night he had a very bad headache and fatigue. This morning he is feeling better, but he still has slight dizziness. He is still three weeks away from getting the next vaccine. He wanted to know if he would be able to still take it. He wanted to be immune and to know if there would be any reason why he cannot take the second dose of the vaccine. He then mentioned these symptoms that he is speaking of are general symptoms and he assumed other people have reported them along with him because it is listed on the information sheet. Outcome of the events of dizziness, fatigue and headache was recovering, other events was unknown.    Information about batch/lot number has been requested.
