I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

                                                headache; she had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. This pharmacist reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:30 AM at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in jaw and headache. Concomitant medication included Tylenol for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw. The patient (retired pharmacist) stated that she and her husband got the COVID shot on Tuesday (19Jan2021) and prior to getting the vaccine, she was suffering temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw and took Tylenol that morning. Patient just came back from urgent care and was prescribed a dose pack of prednisone to take for 5 days for the TMJ and she is concerned about taking it because she knows it can suppress the immune system and she does not want to make the vaccine less effective. She was trying to figure out if she should just tough it out and not take the steroid. She and her husband, who was on warfarin, had a mild headache after the first shot but he has sinus issues and she had the TMJ, they were not sure if the headaches were from those things or the vaccine. Patient asked if she can take Tylenol since she found out that that may not have been a good idea. She was advised to take Prednisone and she was asking if she can take it or will it affect the efficacy of the vaccine. She stated not knowing that taking Tylenol can effect the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine, she had taken Tylenol before she received her COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 (Tuesday). Patient said her TMJ jaw pain was still a problem after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, so she had gone to her doctor, and her doctor prescribed Prednisone, a corticosteroid. She said she was not going to take the Prednisone because she does not want the Prednisone to cause an issue with the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said she then read that studies performed on children said that children that took Tylenol did not get as good of an immune response from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said since she already took a dose of Tylenol for her TMJ jaw pain before receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, she was afraid to take any further Tylenol. Patient clarified that the Tylenol she took was the generic Equate brand, 500mg. She said she took 2 Equate brand generic Tylenol 500mg for jaw pain on Tuesday morning (19Jan2021) prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had disposed of Equate brand generic Tylenol bottle and cannot provide the UPC, Lot and Expiration Date. Reported that both her and her husband did have a headache all day long after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband believes his headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine or from her TMJ jaw pain. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she usually has a headache accompanying the TMJ jaw pain. Also reported that she always gets her vaccines in her left arm. Patient was surprised she and her husband did not have anything more than a headache after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said when she had the Shingles Vaccine, she could not lay on her left side for a week because her arm was so sore for 2 days, and when she had the flu shot she could not get out of bed for a day. Patient clarified she got her first dose of the Shingrix Shingles Vaccine in Nov2020, and does not plan to go and get her second Shingrix dose until the summer of 2021. Patient stated that she does not want the second dose of the Shingrix Vaccine interfering with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient had headache on 19Jan2021, reported as mild. Patient also had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021, and the left arm soreness was gone in less than 24 hours. Patient further clarified that she had a headache before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her TMJ jaw pain acts up if she eats. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she gets an excruciating headache. She said she has no headache pain at all right no. Patient expected to have kind of a worse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine based on what other people have been saying. The events were assessed as non-serious. Outcome of the event headache and mild soreness in her left arm  was recovered in Jan2021. Patient does not think her headache pain was related to the COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event headache cannot be totally excluded. The underlying temporomandibular joint and headache may be cofounders.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082288 same drug/reporter, similar events, different patient

On 19Jan2021, the patient was feeling really bad, had a bad headache, general malaise and was feeling sick and nauseated. She was not feeling well and has not been feeling well the last 3 days. She thought the side effect would be right after getting the vaccine however hers started on 19Jan2021 (2 days ago). She stated she had an awful headache which she still has and had nausea. She wanted to know if it was normal to have happened this far away from receiving the vaccine, this amount of time from the vaccine. The patient reported that she is not quite as bad now, but she still feels it. The patient was worried it will not go away (Jan2021). The patient became frustrated and stated that she was just trying to find out if what she was feeling was normal.

                                                Patient was here for her 2nd dose vaccine and during her wait time her tongue started to feel funny and swell slightly. Staff was notified as they were talking with her that  her voice sounded a little funny and thick. She also started to cough on a regular interval. As staff continued talking with her she stated her throat started to feel funny and tight. Staff notified other healthcare personal and moved her to the private  treatment area. She continued to complain of thick tongue and continued to speak different then her baseline. We elected to give 50 mg Benadryl IM. She was also placed on the ECG showing sinus rhythm with O2 stats of 100 % and her blood pressure was 149/61, After the Benadryl, she stated she started to fell somewhat better. After about 10 minutes her tongue started to swell again and when she turned her head to speak to a staff member her airway shut off due to swelling. Staff quickly turned her head back to forward she was able to breath again.  She advised that she needed to be transported and was going to get 0.3 epi IM in her left arm. She did state prior to Epi being given she was now also having trouble focusing visually. Dr arrive to assess her and agreed that she needed transported. EMS arrived and care was turned over to Huntertown EMS to transport the patient to Medical Center.

Reported flu like symptoms over the next two days (fatigue, nausea, anorexia). 2/2/21 awoke with abdominal pain and distension. Presented to MHN ED 2/2/21 @ 1100 for workup and initially declined admission and went home. Was called and asked to return for admission and further workup, admitted to MHN 2/2/21 @ 1750. Fever, myalgias, headache. CT abd/pelvis &#34;There is mild diffuse mesenteric edema surrounding the abdominal aorta and proximal branches. Additionally, there is mild bowel wall thickening involving the stomach without discrete mass. This is nonspecific and may represent infectious versus inflammatory changes.&#34; Per provider note &#34;flu-like sx over the weekend that easily coincide with the timing of the COVID Pfizer vaccine. In addition, I wonder if her CT scan findings might also be related to the vaccine.&#34; Discharged home the next day.

She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiry date: 31May2021) via Intramuscularly to left arm on 22Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EW0158) via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder (Deltoid Right) on 11Apr2021 in the afternoon around 14:00 or 14:30 (at 76-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. None history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2 considered as suspect. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for sinus disorder for years as needed. She took it the day before the COVID19 injection. She hasn&#39;t taken it since before getting COVID19 injection. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She didn&#39;t have the ones on the paper. They didn&#39;t say she would have severe throwing up she almost had to call. She was choking on 12Apr2021. She was over it currently. She first threw up on Sunday evening and then was ok. On Sunday (11Apr2021 21:00) she only threw up once, but it was four intervals. Caller clarified an interval was where she would throw up then clean up and then throw up again. Then it was fine. On Monday (12Apr2021), in the evening around 9 PM she started to spin. She went to the bathroom and she was heaving and she couldn&#39;t say how many times she threw up. Her throat was so swollen and it felt like she was choking. Her throat was very raw. Her uvula was so swollen that is why she felt like she was choking. She was about to go the emergency room, but then looked it up. She did treatment that she saw online for 3 days. When she was gagging and coughing she looked up COVID19 Vaccine and it said that her throat would be swollen from severe throwing up. It made a lot of sense. She had all the symptoms listed online and it said it would get better in five days and if not seek treatment. It has gotten better. No visit for ER and Physician Office. Treatment received for all events. The outcomes of the events were resolving.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

Took about five days to feel okay. Took Benadryl (took twice with six hours between doses, took antihistmine,  Levocetiriine, used pro air quite often,    20 mg of Prednisone  at 2:30 am on the 22 and finally felt relief.  Dr.. was informed after I got better.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin. The outcome of the event shaking recovered on an unspecified date; Joint pain and Muscle pain recovered on 19Jan2021; Blinding headache/ severe headache, Fatigue/Extreme tiredness was recovering, chills/ shivers, couldn&#39;t warm up, Neck froze completely, pulled muscles, fatigue was unknown; she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal/ couldn&#39;t move her head, Pain in her neck, Muscles were so sore, Weakness was not recovered.

A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284; expiry date: unknown) , via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 18Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ear problems in the past and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID shot on 18Jan2021. By Wednesday, two days later (20Jan2021), both ears were messed up, she was running a temperature (also reported as low-grade fever), had a headache, and was very nervous. She went to the doctor and her doctor gave her an antibiotic shot, two steroid shots, and some antibiotic ear drops, which did not work. She then did a home call with the doctor and she provided more steroids, an oral pack, and an oral antibiotic for 5 days. She was still having problems with her ears. Mainly her left ear. It goes from ear to ear. She went to the ENT about the earaches which turned out to be infected, and has subsequently been on two rounds of antibiotics, with persistent symptoms that have gotten better over time. Patient wanted to know if this could relate to the COVID Vaccine. She has never had this happen before, and she has been really sick but not this bad. She has had ear problems in the past, but normally the antibiotic liquid drops clear it up. It was like a chronic ear ache. Her earaches were hurting bad. What she is wondering is if it could be a side effect from the first COVID shot. She clarifies that her ears are swollen on the inside. It was an infection somewhere. The antibiotics and steroids have not healed it up. All of these events were still occurring but come and go. For instance, yesterday she had a low temperature but has not yet had one today. The antibiotic ear drops prescribed were Neopoly HC OTSC 1% OTIC SU. NDC: 24208-635-62. Expiry date: Jun2022. She was unsure what the lot was but also sees: 349111. The oral antibiotics she has is Amoxicillin 875mg/125mcg. These are in a pharmacy vial. Use before: 26Jan2022. She was given two steroid shots. One shorter acting and one longer acting. She was unsure of the names. Oral steroid pack: Manufactured by Pharmaceutical name. Prednisone USP 5mg. REV 1016. 314518. lot: 1150419. Expiry date: Feb2022. She also pre-treated with allergic reaction medications. She goes back to the ENT on Thursday. Patient wanted to know if these had happened to anyone before. Outcome of the event pyrexia was unknown, for events ear swelling, ear pain and ear infection was recovering, while for the other events was not recovered.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient reported that she didn&#39;t feel good, felt like she was getting a migraine and after that she started getting dizzy and she thought she was going to help herself and lay down on the bed for about 45 minutes and then she got up after that and walked around on Jan2021. She felt like, she has never had a hangover but it felt like she had a hangover, that was what it felt like, and she thought she hopes that doesn&#39;t last and she got up Wednesday morning (Jan2021) and went to her podiatrist appointment. She didn&#39;t feel good but she was okay so she went to the podiatrist and then later she was fixing supper and she had some grease in a pan that she fried something in and she thought she wanted to get some water in it so she went to go with the pan and she got to the door and took 3 steps back and she thought good Lord, there is something is wrong here. She did empty the water and the grease and she thought well it is going to have to stay there, it was right at the back door so anyway. Her son came home from work and she got him get the blood pressure cuff and take her pressure and it was 158/98 and she thought, this was not good. She said she will just go lay down for a while and she went on to bed. The patient was taken into the hospital via an ambulance. She sat there until about 4-5 hours and later they got to take her blood pressure and result was 189/92 on Jan2021. They gave her some IV because she was dehydrated and she got home, she lives about 30 miles form the hospital so they got home about 3 o&#39;clock and next day she didn&#39;t feel good but she felt better. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital it was an ER visit and they sent her home. She felt Thursday was not a good day she came down off of what had her up. She was going to say no to the second dose because she was sick on her stomach and drunk as a dog, she was really dizzy, very dizzy and she just had to sit down quiet her self. She was supposed to have surgery but because of COVID it has been cancelled 3 times. The outcome of the events were unknown.

                                                She can breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested; Nose started stuffing up again; Her nose just swells; congestion in her chest; her arm was sore/ Little pain in her right leg; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm on 01Feb2021 at 09:10 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breathing problems and COVID-19 on 31Oct2020 in which she waited exactly 90 days to get the vaccine. The patient had a small touch of pneumonia on her lower lobe of her right lung, she was on a lot of antibiotics and a strong herbal solution. She was on one antibiotic for 5 days and another for 7 days. She was on the herbal stuff for 7 days. She took all that stuff and was drinking lemon juice and hot water and breathing in lemon scent and Vicks Salve all in her nose. She also was prescribed an asthma pump. She had all that stuff going into her system. She also was tested, and she has H. Pylori bacteria. She explained her whole family must have that, it&#39;s hereditary. That wasn&#39;t her issue. However, all that she put in her stomach and in her system caused her to have stomach issues. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick. She told the person administering the vaccine that antibiotics made her sick and she was told it didn&#39;t matter and that this wouldn&#39;t interfere with the COVID-19 vaccine. Her stomach was all messed from all that stuff. The patient also has anxiety. She has never been treated with anxiety. She has had anxiety since she was a very young women and she has never been treated for it. When probed for any product information she had available for the medications that messed her stomach up and made her sick she provided the following information: The first medication she took was azithromycin (Z-PAK, lot number: KG0706, expiration date: Nov2021, NDC number: 0781-8089-26) that was dispensed in a little box. Dose was 250 mg which she took daily doses for 5 days. One of the doctors gave her a levofloxacin 50 mg for 7 days. She was given the pump, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL SULFATE HFA INHALATION AEROSOL, lot number: 102B4, expiration data: 20Jan2022) 90mcg per actuation. She explained she only took this once. She was so scared from this stuff. It squirted down her mouth. Another doctor prescribed her omeprazole 40 mg capsule every day because she told him her stomach was messed up. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet, by mouth three times daily for 14 days and clarithromycin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet by mouth twice daily for 14 days. The new doctor also had her taking omeprazole (the doctor wrote another prescription for this). However, this time the dose was 20 mg and she was prescribed to take that twice daily for 14 days. She didn&#39;t finish this medication. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick and the doctor explained because of her bacteria, she ordered the antibiotics to make her feel better. The patient told the doctor if she could live like this, let her not take these medications until she gets her stomach better and she would eat healthy food and find natural antibiotics at the health food store. She mentioned using oregano. She took that once a day. When she knew she was getting ready to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she stopped taking that 2 weeks before taking the vaccine. She stopped taking cholesterol medicine at night 2 weeks ago, it was making her sick to her stomach. She stopped her potassium medicine. She didn&#39;t want any of the medicines interfering with the vaccine. The patient also took an herbal medicine that was called a Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, Elevation Science of Eternal Life. It&#39;s a detox mixture that was very strong. She took this for 7 days. She had lost weight because she was not eating. The patient has always been a junk food eater. She quit eating junk food and that probably also had something to do with her being sick. She cooks all her food. There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date with COVID-vaccine. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She has never had a flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine or shingles vaccine. This was her very first vaccine. Concomitant medication was reported as none. The patient didn&#39;t know if it was anything serious, but she tried to read all the information that was given to her. She was looking at the information and she saw &#34;if you have any difficulty breathing&#34;. That was the only one that she was having. She could breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested. She was calling to see if this was anything serious and if she needed to go the emergency room. Since her breathing has been acting funny, she has been trying to keep moving around. She was cleaning her bathroom and the Bleach Cleaner and other cleaner opened her nose. She was listening to a town hall meeting and when she sat down to listen to it, her nose started stuffing up again. She has just been trying to get up and move around. Since she has been talking on the phone, her breathing was a little better. Her nose just swells. She got up and was beginning to eat breakfast when all of a sudden, the difficulty breathing started happening. It was around 8:45 am this morning (02Feb2021). It has improved, but when she would sit down, it would tighten up and she would have congestion in her chest. Since she has been moving around talking, it has gotten better. Sitting down has something to do with the difficulty breathing. She has had breathing problems before. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, 01Feb2021. She sat for half an hour afterwards and then came home. She then slept all night and stated her arm was sore on Feb2021, but it was feeling better. She also had a little pain in her right leg on the side she received her vaccine on Feb2021, which was currently gone. She wasn&#39;t sure if the breathing problems were from the vaccine or something else. The patient did not go to the emergency room or visited his physician in response to the events. She mentioned that if this continues, she probably will go to urgent care. The outcome of the event dyspnea at rest and respiratory tract congestion was recovering, recovered on Feb2021 for pain in extremity, and unknown for all other events.

Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect.

She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath.

She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included: cholesterol, spinal fusion L4/5, stenosis, allergies to medications, food, or other products: kefex, Zithromax, levofloxacin, oxycontin, methylprednisolone, Lisinopril, ezetimibe, Amlodipine.  She reported she has constant spiking of her blood pressure (BP) and lack of sleep for 37 days (average 1-3 hours daily), since the vaccination. She described the following: She has experienced &#34;dizziness, blurred vision at times, extreme and constant headaches, tons and tons of pain in her neck&#34;. She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours. So weak &amp; constant neck pain that feels like someone is placing pressure around my neck. The blood pressure medication received are the following: Amlodipine from 1Feb2021 until 9Feb2021. She explained it work well to manage her BP but she &#34;could not urinate and had red flashes in [her] face&#34;; therefore, it was stopped by her cardiologist. She was off the BP medication from 9Feb2021 until 17Feb2021. Metoprolol from 18Feb2021 until 25Feb2021, but it didn&#39;t work. She explained it was stopped by her doctor because of side effects. Propranolol in combination with Alprazolam as needed for anxiety. She explained she &#34;took 3&#34; of the tablets for anxiety. Hydralazine 25mg which she started yesterday, after seeing her cardiologist. She explained she only got 3 hours of sleep last night. She woke up around 1:30am/2am&#34; her heartrate was at &#34;93&#34; and she put heat and cold on her neck to settle the pain. She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;. She explained her BP was down to &#34;125/78&#34;, after taking the Benadryl, but got up to &#34;147/90&#34; at 7 am when she attempted to call Pfizer. She explained she has &#34;done [her] due diligence: she consulted HCP, did all the test, she attempted to go for walks and do activities she can tolerate, but her symptoms persist. She added she use to golf and cannot anymore. She explained her symptoms are persisting until this day and her body won&#39;t handle it further. She mentioned she knows she is COVID-19 free because when helping take care of her quadriplegic son in the summer, she tested negative. Outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021277006 same patient, different vaccine dose/AE.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration upper arm probably only about 4inches down from shoulder blade on the left on 12Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID on 01Oct2020. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) as blood thinner. The patient previously took a flu and shingles shot and experienced her redness and swelling on her arm. The patient did not have vaccinations four weeks prior, and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. She got it because she was told by her doctor that her antibodies will not last forever and it was still necessary to get it even though she already had COVID antibodies. She contracted COVID on 01Oct2020, that was the date when she had a positive test then she was last tested in December and she still had the antibodies then. She received her first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday 12Jan2021 and 24 hours later on 13Jan2021, she experienced chills and feeling very hot, which she took Tylenol extra strength for and it disappeared the next day. Her arm also swelled, not the whole arm, she would say about 3 inches around the site, 4 inches at the most and it was still swollen, it was red and itchy. Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events chills, feeling very hot and woke up in a horrible sweat was recovered on 14Jan2021, while the remaining events was recovering.

It was reported that the patient has shrunk and weighed less. Maybe 154 pounds. She was 170. The action taken for ciprofloxacin and pirfenidone was unknown.

When I got up my temperature was 102 and in stayed between 101.5 and just over 102 for about 30 hours.  I also had cold like symptoms, a cough and diarrhea.  It wasn&#39;t until 48 hours after the shot that my temperature was normal.

                                                not feeling well that day; The next morning I was tired because I didnt get good sleep the night before; severe chills; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), intramuscularly left deltoid on 12Jan2021 10:50 at a single dose for prevention (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included cystitis interstitial and headache. There were no concomitant medications. The patient didn&#39;t receive other vaccines in the last 4 weeks. The patient reported that she had her first dose on 12Jan2021 around 10am and she experienced severe chills where she could not get warm and nausea the night of 13Jan2021, about 10pm. It lasted approximately 8 hours. She probably had a temperature, but she was shaking so much, she did not check. She could not get warm. The next day, she was tired, and probably because she could not sleep the night before. The tiredness was back to normal on 14Jan2021 at 8pm. She was awake the whole night until 8am. The chills stopped and she was very, very tired. Around 8pm on 14Jan2021, she felt like her normal self and it was amazing. She was not feeling well that day (unspecified date). She is due for her second dose on 02Feb2021. She added that she had severe chill (&#34;couldn&#39;t get warm&#34;) and nausea then the next morning, she was tired because she didn&#39;t get good sleep the night before and then felt like herself the following day. The nausea stopped 8 hours afterwards. The tiredness was back to normal on 14Jan2021 at 8pm. She mentioned that she was treated for interstitial cystitis before she took the vaccine. She began to experience a headache prior to receiving the vaccination and called the hotline to see if it was COVID. They did not want to test her since she did not have any other symptoms. She got tested for COVID on 18Jan2021, and it came back negative. She inquired if she can take 25mg of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) prior to her receiving her second dose to prevent side effects. Treatment was received by the patient. The outcome of the event feeling unwell was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 14Jan2021 20:00.

She thought it would be temporary and go away, but did not.  She came home, and it was still happening, still having them.  She talked to her daughter and went to the ER.  They did an EKG and blood work for fear of having a heart attack, all was negative.  Didn&#39;t do anything more for her.  After 3 hours and moved to a chair and then it suddenly stopped.  She did have this reaction for about 5 hours.   Still feeling tired but not sure if it was from weather or stress itself.

                                                little depressed; not feeling like herself; weak; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose on the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:30 (lot number: EL0140). Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had no side effects after the first vaccine except for a little tenderness which went away. On 11Jan2021, after receiving the second dose, she felt really tired but which went away. On 20Jan2021 (last Wednesday), she started to feel tired, weak, and not feeling like herself. On 22Jan2021, the patient was a little depressed. She did not have a headache. Her blood pressure was fine and she never had a fever. She had an X-ray back in Sep2020. Her vision is good. She is not hurting anywhere. She doesn&#39;t feel as strong. She doesn&#39;t understand the tiredness, weakness, and depression. Outcome of the event tired was recovered on 11Jan2021, of the events doesn&#39;t feel like herself and weak was not recovered, and of the event depression was recovering. The reporter assessed all the events as related to the bnt162b2. The events depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself were reported as serious: medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of bnt162b2 in triggering the onset depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 78-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3248, expiration date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lupus from 26Feb2019 and ongoing, biopsy done/diagnosed 26Feb2019, known to be cutaneous, unknown if systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-not officially diagnosed as SLE yet but keep monitoring to see, patient sister has possibly compromised immune system with lupus; ongoing allergies, included ongoing allergies/reactions to insect stings, wasp stings-that was first reaction 8-9 years ago-carried EpiPen since then, dye in a contrast medium for CT scan in Sep2020; had serious surgery, 2 subsequent surgeries, couldn&#39;t remember anything within last couple of years, 1st surgery: fall or beginning of 2019; scheduled to have surgery to repair abdominal surgery as a result of all the other stuff, had to cancel it and reschedule for spring due to rash, rash diagnosed as lupus; compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic / chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity; overweight. No allergies/reactions to vaccines historically. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydroxychloroquine (Zydus Pharmaceuticals, Lot number: E003901, Expiry date: 31May2022, NDC: Unknown, UPC: 4181077301, repeatedly verified dispensed in standard amber/orange pharmacy bottle; but had manufacturer label on bottle-no NDC) for lupus. The patient previously used epinephrine (EPIPEN, reported as Epi-pen) first/only time 2020: maybe summer/fall/Sep2020 for anaphylactic reaction to yellow jacket sting. On 24Jan2021 around 2:30pm she had onset of extreme fatigue (just like kind of an overwhelming fatigue). She had not even discussed having the vaccine with her PCP and did not consider extreme fatigue to be serious or something she needed to contact the doctor about. She ended up getting home, eating something, going upstairs and going to sleep (went &#34;straight to bed&#34;). She slept really well. Outcome improved, she was better, ok. She wondered if this was an extreme reaction to the vaccine or was this normal because this was the first shot, she read that the second dose creates even more pronounced side effects. She was asking if that was a normal reaction and can she expect that after the second dose? No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse event did not result in Emergency Room or Physician Office, and patient was not hospitalized. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the event was recovering.

Getting very hot and cold started 12:00PM Monday (25Jan2021) night. Getting hot and cold was like the chills. She has 27 chronic illnesses but doesn&#39;t think they have anything to do with the shot. She was grateful she got the shot and hopes everyone at Pfizer was able to get the shot. The outcome of the event &#39;sheets were soaking wet, she kept having to urinate&#39; was recovered on 27Jan2021, diarrhea and getting very hot and cold was recovering, lost 3 pounds and chills was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

The following information was gathered from discussion with RPH at Hospital. The patient received second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/26/2021. The patient then had nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. On 2/27/2021, the patient went to the bathroom and while on the toilet, had a vasovagal event which led to her hitting the side of the face while falling. Patient was then taken to the hospital for evaluation. The patient does have a pacemaker but the cause of the event was determined to likely be due to dehydration. Lab work was performed and pertinent lab values include: potassium of 3.1, SCr of 0.8, and BUN of 13. The patient received potassium supplementation and IV hydration in the hospital. Patient was discharged on 2/28/2021. Of note, the patient does have a pacemaker and a follow-up appointment with cardiology to evaluate the pacemaker was scheduled upon discharge.

Concomitant medications included rizatriptan benzoate (MAXALT) at 10 mg, as needed for migraine. Consumer stated, &#34;I had Tubular Dysfunction been diagnosed many years ago and I live with dizzy every day In Mar2021. I have tried everything to get rid of it and nothing is working. This is going on for Probably 40 years may be more anyway (Intent: History). I had my second vaccine on 10Mar2021 and on the first day, my doctor told me since I had the reaction to the regular Flu shot a few years ago my doctor told me get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and the first day everything was wonderful. I was so happy you know no reaction, I didn&#39;t have any. The first time I got the flu shot I was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine, it was beautiful. I thought I was free and then the next day my arm got real sore and I expected that and I expected to have a fever I expected to feel nauseous and all but the dizziness set in and just got progressively worse and it will be a week tomorrow since the vaccine still I was dizzy In Mar2021. I have been so off-center In Mar2021. Sunday I could hardly do over I was just so sick with the dizziness and yesterday the same thing and this morning I thought I will get over maybe today will be a good day and it&#39;s the same. I called my neurologist and he said that any pre-existing condition can be exaggerated by the vaccine while the system is building up his anti-bodies so I expected but is this going to go away, this thing, is this going to go away and reported just so beside myself, I just can&#39;t live like this anymore everyday you know this is beyond dizzy.&#34; tried taking, I do have a prescription for it starts with M wait a minute it hasn&#39;t helped but I tried it , if it doesn&#39;t help for the first time I won&#39;t take it again but I have a prescription for Meclizine 25 mg Tablets.

I got it on Wednesday and by Friday, I have a pre-existing condition and it is called Vestibular Dysfunction. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the Vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years. So, I live with dizzy all the time. But by Friday, it is just unbelievable dizzy, Saturday was worse, Sunday was even worse, yesterday was little bit better. Today, I am still shaking and dizzy and Tomorrow will be one week since I have the shot and I read that stuff happened in the first week and I was wondering, have you had the other people with the same problem, Consumer further added, &#34;It is not an inconvenience, this is horrible way to live. I feel dizzy all the time, this is horrible. Was I told that I should talk to you about, can the shot exacerbate a bad situation like this, they told me to call you, now I getting no help at all can anybody tell me.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Nothing I have no recollection of any of that no, I just started coughing and they told me to go to the emergency room so I did you know In Mar2021.

She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

                                                Pneumonia after getting the COVID Vaccine; Pneumonia was related to MRSA; Very weak; mild fever; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 78-years-old, administered in arm on 25Feb2021 15:45 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus from 2011 (Verbatim: Diabetic; Diagnosed 10 years ago), rheumatoid arthritis from 1995 (Verbatim: Rheumatoid arthritis; Diagnosed in 1995), cardiac failure congestive from Oct2020 (Verbatim: Congestive Heart Failure), adrenal insufficiency from 1990 (Verbatim: Adrenal insufficiency; Diagnosed in probably 1990), atrial fibrillation from 2017 (Verbatim: Atrial fibrillation; Diagnosed 4 years ago). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (&#34;she takes lots of medications. Too long of list she probably takes 15 different medications, reporter chose not to provide them). No-other vaccines were given at the same time. She gets the flu vaccine every year, shingles vaccines, pneumonia vaccines every year but, has no idea where they were manufactured. Confirmed she did not get the listed vaccines at the same time she got the COVID Vaccine. The patient&#39;s husband and the patient (his wife) both received their 1st COVID shot on the 25Feb2021 and was scheduled for 3 weeks later. He got his COVID on the 18Mar2021. The patient got Pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital but he does not know the exact time the Pneumonia started. It developed over a period of several day started with a mild fever (in Mar2021) and after the 2nd or 3rd day her fever spiked and that&#39;s when she was admitted to the hospital. He reports his wife went into the hospital with Pneumonia on 18Mar2021, the day she was supposed to get the 2nd shot. It was also reported that Pneumonia was related to MRSA. She laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks, the weakness (&#34;very weak&#34;) may have happened in the hospital or a few days before, date was confirmed to be on 15Mar2021. The event &#34;pneumonia&#34; was totally unrelated to COVID and now she is in a nursing home, she went in on 26Mar2021. She probably won&#39;t be able to have the 2nd shot for a couple of weeks. She was in there for a couple of weeks and still quarantined. He wanted to know will the fact that she is not getting the 2nd shot at the 3-week interval reduce the efficacy of the vaccine since she is getting the 2nd dose late. Does it make a difference with the effectiveness of the vaccine if she&#39;s going take the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks or even a month and a half rather than the usual 21 days interval? No treatment before going to the hospital other than calling the doctor and the doctor saying take her to the hospital (not reported if patient received treatment during hospital stay). No treatment done over the weekend, while she was in the nursing home. The adverse event pneumonia required a visit to Emergency Room. The patient was hospitalized from 18Mar2021 to 26Mar2021. Investigations included had a lot of blood work done, a CT scan, an X-ray on unspecified dates. He does not have any of the results but, the physicians have them. The outcome of the event mild fever was unknown, for very weak was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovered on 26Mar2021.

A 79-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiration date unknown), intramuscular on the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 14:15 to 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications, no additional vaccines administered on the same date of BNT162B2 and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient previously received flu vaccine and experienced a slight reaction to the flu vaccine, she does not recall when she had it. She got it in the supermarket (she was told one vaccine was super and one flu vaccine was regular, and she had the super vaccine and she thinks that is why she had the side effects). She does not know the name of the flu vaccine or have lot number to provide. The patient was calling about the COVID vaccine that she received a couple of days ago. She received the first dose on Friday, 08Jan2021. She wanted to call and report the side effects. She had a mild headache and was tired. She started feeling tired on Saturday, reported that she felt wiped out. It was reported that the events headache and feeling tired both started on Saturday (09Jan2021). It was also reported that she is about 5&#39;1&#34;, she thinks she lost an inch, and that her headache is going away - it was not a major headache, not a migraine. She also took Tylenol as treatment. Her tiredness went away about 48 hours later, and confirmed she recovered completely as of that day.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included major reaction to eating conch, and tested positive for COVID on 22Nov2020 There were no concomitant medications. Patient read that was not a good thing to do, to get the vaccine after only 2 months instead of 3 from diagnoses. When she had COVID she had major headache, chills, and diarrhea. After the vaccine she had had the same thing, terrible chills, bad headache and diarrhea on Jan2021. The side effects say that this was normal but she wants to know should she have waited the 90 days before getting the vaccine. Patient still had the headache and chills but she took an Imodium and the diarrhea was better. Patient had also fatigue in Jan2021,and slept all day yesterday (13Jan2021). She has had a very sore arm and at 2am she woke up trembling with chills on Jan2021. Outcome of the event chills and headache was not recovered, for diarrhea was recovering and for the remaining events was unknown. Patient had a major reaction to eating conch and wanted to make sure there was no shellfish involve in the vaccine.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

This 79 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284) in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 12:00 PM or 01:00 PM, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pacemaker (she just had it checked on 18Jan2021 at the cardiologist and they said it was good for five more years), heart issue, dementia (before getting the vaccine). Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Jan2021 the patient experienced dementia (she had a bit of dementia right now, which she also had before getting the vaccine) and her feet felt like they were numb, like neuropathy (maybe she had that, it had never been checked). Since 19Jan2021 the patient could not walk, had difficulty in walking. She was using a cane as she did not want to fall, she weighed 200 lbs and her partner would never be able to get her up if she fell. She was able to walk with the cane. The patient said that there had been no other treatment for her difficulty in walking and it seemed to get better. The initial caller (patient&#39;s partner) said she had the shot too on 18Jan2021 and did not have those symptoms, she was not the one who was sick, she did not know what else was going on in her partner&#39;s body, they did not think the shot caused it. The patient said she was supposed to be on a sleep apnea machine but she could not get in to the doctor to get the machine checked, it needed a test to be rechecked but they could not get in to do it because of everything that is going on. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 08Feb2021 at 10:00AM. Difficulty in walking was improving. The other events outcome was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient reported that she had her shot this morning (29Jan2021) at about 08:30 and towards evening, the shot started to hurt and so she wanted to make sure that it didn&#39;t go against anything, and put a little ice on it or maybe it was worthless on ice on certain situations after the fact that she thought this was too late. She wanted to make sure she could do that. The patient&#39;s blood pressure also went up on 29Jan2021. She was taking several different medicines for blood pressure. She took them already tonight. She was hoping that she will be feeling a little bit better. Sometimes, she gets a little fever on Jan2021, also like maybe 99 (unspecified).

She has three medications namely clonidine, losartan and propranolol. She has a lot of medical conditions that was why she was calling because she takes other medications.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

Medical history included high blood pressure (diagnosed prior to 10 years ago), respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities including diabetes, diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, and obesity (Little on the heavy side but she does not think she is obese); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure at 20 mg once daily, started at least 10 years ago. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that the patient had received the two doses, she had shortness of breath in the morning around 08:30 on 08Mar2021 and went to her doctor. They did blood work and she was put in the hospital because the doctor found out she had blood clots in her lungs (11Mar2021, 13:00). The patient was hospitalized for blood clot in lung from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021. She doesn&#39;t know if it came from the vaccine or not. She was sent home on Eliquis for 6 months to get blood clots from her lungs. She also has oxygen for when she needs it and mostly for when she is ambulatory. It was further clarified that when she went to her doctor&#39;s office, they did blood work. When they got results, they called her at home and told her that she had to call the ambulance and go the hospital in the ambulance, so she did; Ambulance to ER (hospital) on 11Mar2021. There was also a problem with the left ventricle of her heart (12 Mar2021 12:30). She stated whichever part pumps blood into the pulmonary vein, something is wrong there. She was going to have an echocardiogram to check that out again on 29Apr2021. She does not know the outcome of that yet until she gets that done. They gave her Eliquis as a blood thinner and oxygen.  She has not really needed the oxygen around the house.  But if she goes outside, she may. She took it to the grocery store with her and if she needed it, she used it.  She also had a headache after second dose on 24Feb2021 09:00. She felt tired on 24Feb2021 21:00 and stuff (as reported). The outcome of event blood clot in lung was unknown; the outcome of other events was recovering.

Concomitant medications included lisinopril for blood pressure high plus an unspecified long list. When she got the shot, she got bruise on the injection site about the size of a half dollar. She has headache too, first two days. Onset of headache was reported as 8th or 9th day after vaccination (Jan2021). The patient is supposed to go back on the 29th.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

AN 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at 13:00 (at the age of 80-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included highly sensitive and highly allergic to everything from food to medicine; had been through near death with allergies; allergic to penicillin, iodine and shellfish; high blood pressure, eye disorder (unspecified), allergies with her sinuses. Concomitant medications were not reported, but the patient took unspecified high blood pressure and eye medication. The patient previously took dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride (DARVON), ether and castor oil and experienced allergies; sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) for severe acute sinusitis on Jan2021 (about a month ago). On 11Feb2021 at 13:20, the patient start feeling dizzy and faint like, and felt a little tired. She came home and went to bed and on 11Feb2021, had itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine) and on the right side of the arm near the elbow, the middle part of the stomach and the neck (itching came and went) and later, her sinuses started to drain. On 12Feb2021, the patient&#39;s feet felt stiff and the bone in the right leg felt strange. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had pain in the shoulder. The patient queried if she can take aspirin for the pain in the shoulder and diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) if the itching comes back. The clinical outcome of pain in the shoulder was unknown, of &#34;itching on right side of arm near elbow, middle part of stomach and neck&#34;, &#34;feeling dizzy and faint like&#34;, tired, sinuses started to drain, &#34;feet felt stiff and bone in right leg felt strange&#34; and &#34;itching on the right shoulder (where she had the vaccine)&#34; was resolving.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9266 and expiry date 31May2021, via unspecified route of administration on 15Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, broke her elbow from 04Dec2020 and surgery from 12Dec2019 and second surgery was from 15Jul2020; the patient thought that the second surgery on her arm was in 2020 and she actually broke her arm in 2019. She thinks it was actually Dec2019 when she broke her arm and the second surgery was on 15Jul2020; ongoing with the arm the pain and movement in that arm (movement disorder) and arm; weakened (same arm that she broke). There were no concomitant medications. The patient was taking the same medications she always takes, and she waited until after the dose to take them. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 lot number EL02162, expiry date 31May2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the vaccine, the second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She experienced some side effects, there was joint pain on 15Feb202 later that nigh and the most obvious thing was exhaustion that began later the same day as well; but one thing was unusual, the strange side effect that has happened on 16Feb2021 was that her hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy but it was much better now, it was the same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before. The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021). The worsened pain and movement has persisted about the same since she noticed it. The patient informed that was the joint she guessed, because she broke the elbow. The outcome of the events hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy, joint pain, exhaustion was recovering, same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before was unknown, while not recovered for the rest of the events.

At first, they were days apart.  Then they started coming closer together.  Yesterday, I had the headache all day until I fell asleep and awoke today (3/5/2l) with just a slight feeling of pressure over my eyes.  Could the vaccination have triggered this?  Could that first headache the day after my vaccination irritated some nerve in that area and started this?  I have never had any headaches unless I had a sinus infection and I don&#39;t have any sign of this now.  I

An 80-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular at Right Deltoid from on 16Feb2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included stomach was burning, heartburn, low thyroid, myocarditis and was hospitalized a year ago, Milroy&#39;s disease, and low potassium, heart disorder and Back disorder. Concomitant medications included bumetanide (BUMEX) Has been taking for about 40 years for Milroy&#39;s disease, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) from Jan2020 for Myocarditis, levothyroxine Has been taking for 40 years for low thyroid, tramadol Started about 10-12 years ago for back, metoprolol from Jan2020 for heart, omeprazole (PROTONIX) Started taking about 8 years ago for stomach was burning and heartburn, potassium Has taken for 40-50 years for low potassium, vitamin B12, vitamin D3 and baby aspirin 81mg, all were ongoing. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL8982) on an unknown date for covid-19 immunization and she got a really sore arm. The patient experienced Myocarditis/had another virus that went to her heart on an unspecified date, brain fog on 17Feb2021, trouble remembering on an unspecified date, incredible fatigue on 17Feb2021, could sleep around the clock on 17Feb2021. The clinical course as following: injection was on 16Feb2021. She has had incredible fatigue. She was asking how long is the fatigue going to last. She knows it is a side effect but she could sleep around the clock. She stated she goes to bed at 6PM if not before then and gets up at around 8AM and by 9AM she could go back to bed. She is sorry she got the shot because she is miserable. She mentioned she has been reading up on the vaccine and it said &#34;you might have fatigue for a day or two&#34;. Her fatigue has now been 8 days. She thought &#34;how long is this going to go on&#34;.  Patient reported that with the first shot she got a really sore arm. Stated she thinks the person giving the injection put the darn thing through her bone. She thought it was to be expected, but it feels like the person who administered the vaccine was a poor shot giver. She provides the first Covid Vaccine Lot number: EL8982. With the second shot her arm did not get sore at all. The only thing she&#39;s having was the fatigue, she can hardly walk past her bed without wanting to get back in it. She tries to get up to shower and fix her hair and be motivated and she&#39;s been fighting the fatigue all day to not get back in bed. When probed for the seriousness criteria of the fatigue, the caller explains she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s that significant. She thought it will go away. However, she was just coming out of myocarditis. She was just in the hospital for myocarditis and they did a heart cath and she has no plugged arteries, nothing. They couldn&#39;t find anything other than she had another virus that went to her heart. She had another virus a year ago January. She wonders if COVID was out there then, because she had never been so sick with the flu. She kind of diagnosed her problem and it was like a wave over her body. She also had a terrible irregular pulse. When she went to the hospital the next morning, her cardiac enzymes were 4.5 times more than normal, her troponin was out of sight. She doesn&#39;t think that would have a bearing because she should be coming out of that myocarditis because of the medication the doctor put her on. She doesn&#39;t know if that would complicate it, too. Her heart doctor said a lot of people have myocarditis, especially athletes, but they are young and fall over dead. 90% of the time, its myocarditis because you don&#39;t know you have it.  She reports she&#39;s getting a foggy brain. Her son asked her who her dentist was because she had a root canal and she couldn&#39;t think of the dentist&#39;s name. She thinks her son threw that in because her son knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to remember. She&#39;s not confused. It&#39;s just difficult to get the word out, but if she waits a couple minutes, she has the answer. She is also getting old, too. She lives by herself; she has no stimulation and she thinks that is significant to her circumstances. She thinks it&#39;s a problem with the COVID-19 injection. Caller explains she had blood work very recently about 2 weeks ago. She just looked at lab reports and everything was okay except one of the vitamins was a tiny bit high (she can&#39;t remember what the vitamin was), but nothing she was worried about. It could have been a Potassium was a little high, but she is not worried about that. Her main question is how long the fatigue last, she thought for only 1-2 days. She mentions she took her temperature every morning and its always like 97 something and it&#39;s never wavered. The outcome of the events brain fog, incredible fatigue, and could sleep around the clock was not recovered and the outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, viral myocarditis is most likely due to a viral infection in this patient with cardiovascular co-morbidities and is not related to suspect product.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

By night, muscle ache was continual and continued throughout the night.  Very difficult to walk. Sunday ... called Telehealth around noon, They triaged me into Dr.&#39;s office.  By Sunday afternoon, less discomfort, but still a headache. During this discomfort time, I would take 2 Tylenol (500 mg), which relieved it. Before I settled down for the night, I took 1 Tylenol and when I woke up at 3:00 a.m., the ache was not there (the Tylenol would have worn off by then). Monday a.m. ... could walk much better. The headache and the constant muscle ache are gone.  Nurse called; I am to keep watch, and if there are any changes for the worse, I will go into the Dr.&#39;s office.

Her daughter was nurse and she said those were normal side effects of the shot. She did not want to report this. She was better than she was on Thursday. She was not calling to report anything.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1284; Expiry Date: 30Apr2021) on 14Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE in the right arm for covid-19 immunisation, so she did not get the virus.  Medical history included Inflammatory bowel disease. There were no concomitant medications. she was allergic to Sulfa. She had no sleep the first night on 14Jan2021. The next day on 15Jan2021 she had a fever. Her temperature was 99.8 then later that day it was 103. She took an Aspirin. Friday night on 15Jan2021, she slept alright but sweat some, which was pretty normal. Saturday morning on 16Jan2021, her temperature was fine but she starred to get blurred vision like a migraine. She took another Aspirin and it went away. Later that day her temperature was normal at 97.2. She was a pretty active person. After she had the shot around 8 AM-10 AM in the morning, at 12 or 1230 she went out and took down her Christmas lights and she thought she felt good so she was going to trim her plants and she wondered if that had anything to do with her adverse events. Her arm did not hurt or anything. She is wondering if her activity had anything to do with disrupting the medicine? She was using that arm a lot, she probably should not have done it. She will not do it again. The outcome of Starred to get blurred vision like a migraine was recovered on 16Jan2021, of other events were recovered on 15Jan2021.

After the patient got her first vaccine on 16Jan2021 (also reported as 15Jan2021) which was almost a week now, she was experiencing side effects. In Jan2021, the patient had chills, fever of 101, swollen lymph nodes, and aches. The patient had swollen glands or lymph nodes at the base of her skull, the lymph node venapathy (unspecified; as reported). The patient underwent a COVID-19 test yesterday (21Jan2021) to be sure (unknown results). The patient asked that if this is from the vaccine, how long could she expect to have these side effects. The patient was scheduled for it for the second dose in February. As treatment for the events, the patient was taking ibuprofen (MOTRIN), had taken paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH) at 1000 mg every 6 hours, and ibuprofen (ADVIL) at 400 mg. The patient had not recovered from the events. The patient considered that the events had a causality with the suspect product.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions. Her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered high up in the muscle of her left arm, close to the shoulder joint. She said the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection didn&#39;t hurt, and her left arm never got sore. She said on 30Dec2020 she had lab work done for her oncologist. She went about every other month for blood work to make sure she was still in remission. She saw her oncologist on 06Jan2021, and her oncologist said her blood work looked pretty good and was better. She asked her oncologist about the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her oncologist said she definitely wanted her to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. Her next appointment with her oncologist was in Mar2021. She said she had been seeing her oncologist every month, but her oncologist this time, wanted to try seeing her after 2 months. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of events rigors, shaking was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of events muscle and joint aches/her muscles hurt, equilibrium was off, aching all over, tired, bone and muscle in her body hurt, hands and body were jerking was recovering. The outcome of event feels cold was not recovered.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I returned home and within the hour I began to feel &#34;very tired&#39; and lay down in my bed.  Within minutes, my left thump had spasms and painful cramping and &#34;froze&#34; I massaged my thump for about 5 minutes and the pain subsided.  I then had painful cramping in my left calf and then the entire leg which then followed by Muscle pain and cramping in both legs.  I was told that I should exercise, so I went for a long walk.  When I returned home, i felt even worse so I went back to bed. Headaches began. I had flu-like symptoms (chills and discomfort) I covered my self with two blankets and drank lots of water and took an Aleve.which upset my stomach.  3/03 (the next morning), my usual sinus stuffiness was Gone! and I could breathe better than i have in a long time (by days end my sinusitis had returned) and so had my headache. Today 3/04 I still feel exhausted and I have swelling, puffs under my eyes (not usual) and occasional headaches.  My Left Arm (area of the inoculation) Has Never Been Painful!!!!!!

She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this.

She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

                                                fever/100.9 degrees Fahrenheit; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  An 82-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection lot no. and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  It was reported that patient had the covid vaccine on Thursday (14Jan2021) and on Saturday (16Jan2021) night, she started running temperature and had fever. She took  paracetamol (TYLENOL) every 4 hours and on Sunday (17Jan2021) she was still running a fever. Today (18Jan2021), it&#39;s about 100.9 degrees Fahrenheit. Wants to know if that is normal for this vaccine. Yesterday, she laid in bed all day and does not know if she can continue to use paracetamol (TYLENOL) and quite concerned about still running a fever. She states it didn&#39;t start right away and wanted to know how long the fever will last.  The outcome of the event was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Attempted to vomit but only gaged.  Friend called at 700am and I wasn&#39;t making much sense.  Later in the day I seemed alright, became cold in the evening and fever had returned.  At 4 am morning of 2/17 I woke up soaking wet.  Went back to sleep and seemed to be fine when I got up at 8am.  It is now 2 weeks since I had this shot and I have experienced no further problems.  My daughter-in-law Is a doctor and she said I should report these side effects.

On 1/12/21  I received a call from the nursing home that my mom had stopped eating and drinking and that she had nothing to eat or drink for 3 days. I asked them why they didn&#39;t call me sooner but they did not have an answer. I was told to come in because she was very lethargic and possible dehydrated.  They tested her for Covid the morning of 1/12/21 and she tested negative.  I went into see my mom and she was barely conscious.  They gave her fluids intravenously but it had no positive affect on her condition.  On 1/14/21 she tested positive for covid and was moved to their covid unit.  I called in Hospice comfort care on 1/15/21.  My. mom died on 1/17/21.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received BNT162B2(Lot# EW5318) on 07Feb2021, at 82 years old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event (no reaction). Other historical vaccine included Flu shot (influenza vaccine) on an unspecified date and experienced almost killed her. The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of overwhelming feeling of dizziness and unable to visually focus. Outcome of the event dizziness was not recovered; outcome of the event unable to visually focus (visual disturbance) was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021; while room was spinning (spinning sensation) was recovered on 09Mar2021, while unknown for the other events.

There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. Everything went fine, she felt good, nothing at all happened; then, in the morning about 8 AM or 9 AM of 20Jan2021, when she got up, she was very dizzy and she fell on to her bed and her little dog jumped on top of her, her dog was scared. She did not know if this normal thing after the vaccine. She is going to go to her regular arthritis doctor on 08Feb2021. She sees an arthritis doctor but she doesn&#39;t think that would have any bearing on this. She didn&#39;t to call them but she was thinking about calling them and telling them about how it felt. The dizziness had majorly resolved but she just feels extremely tired on Jan2021 and she is really okay but she wanted to make sure that they knew what was going on. She is just watching TV and seeing the new president come in and taking it easy today. She felt wonderful the day after she got the dose and she is not very easy person to have problems with her health, she is like a horse so this is surprising to her. She is fine now, just tired which is not anything unusual she just wanted to call to make sure they knew. She is never dizzy, she does not have any problems with her health. The administration of the vaccine does not hurt her at all, just like nothing ever happened. Outcome of the dizziness was recovered on Jan2021 while of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                cough; Temperature of 99.8; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.   An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration injected in the right arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose as COVID vaccine to avoid getting the virus. Medical history included high blood pressure. The patient had no other patient history. Concomitant medications included warfarin which started maybe 10 years ago and an unspecified medication for high blood pressure. The reporter took her mother, who&#39;s 83, and herself, on Saturday morning and got the COVID vaccine. Her mother woke up Sunday with a 99.8 temperature and she has been coughing real bad (cough) on 17Jan2021. The reporter asked if this was a side effect of the vaccine. This was her mother&#39;s first dose. Her underlying question was, after all this, she heard the second dose was worse, so the reporter wanted to know,  should her mother get the second one if her mother has these symptoms, the reporter heard the second dose was worse and would give some symptoms.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

Her fever was first checked about 11:30AM by her son and it was 101 degrees.  During the afternoon, about 3PM, she ran a higher fever (102 degrees).  The family consulted her primary care physician, who advised hydration and a Tylenol.  After talking with the physician, about 4pm,  the family gave her a 500 mg Tylenol, which brought the fever down to just under 100 degrees by 8pm Saturday night.  She also had aching legs at that time. but no longer had a backache. She slept Saturday night and awakened on Sunday, Feb 28, with a fever of 99 degrees.  Around Noon another Tylenol 500 mg tablet was administered.   During Sunday afternoon, the fever dropped to around 98.2 (Patient has a normal temperature of 97.3 or 97.4, well documented).   On Monday, March 1, 2021, at 11:00am, her temperature was normal, 97.4.  She said she still felt tired and her legs &#34;don&#39;t feel quite right&#34;.  However, our family feels she is doing much better and she has enough energy to do some of her normal activities and participate in conversation.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported: did not get a card that lists NDC, Lot, Expiration) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. It was also reported that no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient did not require visit to Emergency Room and stated that she was desperate and would&#39;ve gone but she didn&#39;t have a ride and added she is worried about the second. Also, the patient did not required visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

An 84-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 14Jan2021 09:00 at a single dose for vaccination. Medical history included Defibrillator and she is on oxygen. The patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications. When the reporter (patient&#39;s caregiver) got to the patient&#39;s house on 15Jan2021, the patient had a temperature of 100.5 and did not feel good. She gave the patient 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL), water and put her in bed. She was going to wake her up in a few minutes and will retake her temperature. She would like to know what to do and what do they recommend. It was reported that the patient got her first dose on 14Jan2021 and that night, she was not feeling good but the reporter did not know if the patient took her temperature, and the patient just went to bed. In the morning of 15Jan2021, the reporter got there about 11:00 and when she checked her temperature and found it was 100.5. The patient has a defibrillator and she is on oxygen. The patient had fever of 100.5 on 15Jan2021. The patient is in bed and the reporter wanted to ask for opinion on what to do because she was not familiar with any of this stuff and she just saw the paperwork that they had from the vaccination so she was calling to know what does she need. She gave her 2 TYLENOLs at 11:45 and told the patient that they will see within an hour. The outcome of the event pyrexia was not recovered while the outcome of the event malaise was unknown.

An 84-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249) via intramuscular at arm left on 13Jan2021 13:00 at single dose for prevention because of age group. Medical history included hypothyroid diagnosed many years ago, having Covid in Jun2020. Concomitant medications were unknown. The patient was really sick from an unspecified date. The reporter was starting to wonder if the patient should take the second dose. The patient was in bed for 2 days, could not eat and was hurting all over at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. Her joints were aching at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021.  She had a fever and not really chills, but she just never could get warm and was really cold at 23: 00 on 13Jan2021. She went to bed and woke up on that same date, 13Jan2021, and it started at 11pm.  She guessed it was disabling.  As it went on, it got better. By Friday, she was finally able to eat. She has plenty of weight to fall back on for not eating. By Friday, she started eating again. She was still not back to normal yet though. She just felt like she could not get up.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

An 84-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose in Feb2021 (9 days before this report) for Covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had little reaction like fever in Feb2021 and also went to the hospital. The event was considered life threatening. The outcome of event was unknown.  Reporter wanted to know if her reaction was related to the vaccine even though she received it 9 days before, if it was possible that she was exposed to the virus and since she already received the vaccine if it will test false positive, and if she tested positive will she still be able to receive the 2nd dose.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot number: EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 23Feb2021 12:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation from an unknown date and allergies to penicillin. The patient is not pregnant. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included cyanocobalamin (B12-VITAMIIN), vitamin b complex (B COMPLEX), calcium (CALCIUM), ascorbic acid (VIT C), and rivaroxaban (XARELTO) from unspecified dates in two weeks. On 24Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm was sore for a day however the day following the vaccination and the day after that (Wed and Thursday) patient had periods of dizziness like her atrial fibrillation was acting up every few minutes all day, both days. Patient was fatigued and took 2 naps each day. No treatment was received for the AEs. Patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and not tested with COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the event left arm was sore for a day was recovered on 25Feb2021, and for the other events, it was unknown.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

Around 3/2/2021, she saw her physician complaining of pain in her arm, which was attributed to gout.  At the time, she also had a nonproductive cough, generalized weakness and one episode of loose stool.  She presented to the emergency room on 3/7/21 with significant hypoxia.  She tested positive for COVID 19 by both rapid test and PCR.  A quantitative test for COVID antibodies was sent out to a reference lab on 3/7/2021 and resulted on 3/11/2021 as &gt;250 U/mL.  Pt. required CPAP, BiPAP, High Flow Oxygen and ultimately intubation.  Was not oxygen dependent before hospitalization. Pt. treated with dexamethasone, 2 doses of Remdesivir (then held due to acute kidney injury), tocilizumab X 1 dose, 1 unit COVID-19 convalescent plasma.  Pt. expired on 3/19/2021.  Sample sent for genome sequencing to check for variants of interest in joint effort between pathology and infectious disease.  Report not yet available.

                                                This is an 84-year-old woman who several weeks ago began having issues with weakness, nausea vomiting and abdominal discomfort.  She had at least 2 hospitalizations at another facility.  About 6 weeks ago she received her 1st SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and apparently had fever and malaise following the vaccination.  She continued to have ongoing weakness and failure to thrive. Three weeks ago she received her 2nd vaccine.  At about the same time she began to have worsening of her overall weakness and then for the last several days prior to admission she has had deteriorating mental status, weakness and was brought to the hospital on March 27th with severe altered mental status and possible seizures. Following her admission here she developed worsening respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.  She is currently ventilated and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging scanning of the brain with contrast demonstrates areas of restricted diffusion suggesting diffuse areas of encephalomyelitis.  Lumbar puncture demonstrated 1 white blood cell and 9 red blood cells with normal glucose and normal protein.  Cultures have been no growth.  A cerebral spinal fluid meningitis panel has shown no evidence of the presence of DNA to common bacterial pathogens.  PCR is further negative for HSV 1 and 2, varicella zoster, enterovirus and cryptococcus.  West Nile virus antibodies have not been sent on either serum or cerebral spinal fluid. Blood cultures have been no growth.  Urine culture had a light growth of Enterococcus.  Fiberoptic bronchoscopy was done and bronchoalveolar lavage cultures and studies are all negative. She has been started on plasma exchange but so far has had no clinical improvement. Electroencephalogram demonstrates diffuse generalized slowing consistent with encephalopathy as well as a single area that may be epileptiform. I do not have any history of travel or obvious recent exposures to ticks or mosquitos. The question of this being a vaccine related encephalomyelitis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been raised. The question of this being a vaccine related encephalomyelitis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has been raised.

This pharmacist reported that an 85-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) intramuscular at single dose on 21Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the first dose on unknown date. Relevant history and concomitants drugs were not reported. Per reporter, the patient was not seeing anything crazy on her chart. The patient got the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 21Jan2021. On 22Jan2021, she had been tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID-19 Rapid test).  The patient had cough and low grade fever since unknown date. Relevant test was none. Outcome of event was unknown. The nurse practitioner wanted to do a monoclonal antibody infusion and the pharmacist was wondering if they could do that?   When probed for causality, the pharmacist responded: &#34;I guess not I&#39;m not going to comment on that, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have the patient&#39;s actual file.&#34;  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, lack of efficacy of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. However, individuals may not be protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. It is unlikely that the patient would have fully developed immunity due to the very short time lag between the second vaccine dose and the event onset.

I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

After the vaccine, she had no new symptoms or signs of vaccine reaction and MD friend reports that he checked her pulse which was not elevated from baseline. On 1/16,  she awakened and continued to feel at her recent baseline. However, in the early afternoon, she complained of  headache, nausea/epigastric pain, and chest heaviness. These apparently were not unusual symptoms for her to feel intermittently.  Per her niece, who has a home O2 sat device, her 02 sat that morning was 97 with a HR of 87 irregularly irregular. She was afebrile. (continue on page 2)

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

I offered to call 911  and did so after she consented.  The police arrived within two minutes and the ambulance arrived approximately 90 seconds later.  The police officer was interviewing the patient (who was still conscious and alert) about what was wrong.  I was asked what the patient received.  I responded that she had been given the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and was then told that I could go back inside by the EMT&#39;s who showed up relatively soon thereafter.

                                                Congestive cough; Weakness; didn&#39;t have an appetite; legs felt stiff, or almost frozen; Severe muscle weakness/extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body; tremendous fatigue/Tiredness; Couldn&#39;t walk; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers. An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects.

Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy.

On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday.

Caller stated that she had very bad nerves, her husband passed away 2 years ago and she hasn&#39;t overcome that, she lived by her-self, and was wondering if some of this stress, would lead to the symptoms she was having right now.

                                                COVID; COVID; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 87-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 maybe about 11:30am at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing lung disorder started maybe 10 years ago or more, ongoing eye disorder onset may have been about 1 year ago, Carpel tunnel surgery on Jan2021 which was done on both wrists, ongoing weight decreased about 2 years ago, patient had cancer and has had some problems; they were going to the health clinics at the time and she had a horrible cough; she thinks, but does not know, if they did a bronchoscopy; but she saw some doctors and a cancer specialist. The patient had unknown concomitant medications for Thyroid. The patient was diagnosed with COVID 23Jan2021 and hospitalized in response which is ongoing. She is scheduled to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 27Jan2021. The patient body temperature is usually about 97.5 or 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit; but on Saturday: 23Jan2021 her temperature was 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient had her son take her to the hospital where they did the COVID test and it was positive for COVID; so she was admitted to the hospital for this on 23Jan2021. She is hospitalized at the same hospital where she was administered the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and the hospital staff were shocked that she had gotten one of their Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccines. The patient was at the hairdresser&#39;s on 22Jan2021 who said the patient did not look good then; that she really looked sick; but apparently the patient did not have any symptoms 22Jan2021. It was not until unknown time on 23Jan2021 that her temperature went up; patient feels like her reaction is to the fever; where she just wants to sleep all the time. Patient probably does not have any energy. Caller does not hear her coughing when she talks to the patient. Caller clarified that to her awareness the patient&#39;s potential exposure to COVID positive persons would have been through the grocery store; or the health plex gym where caller and the patient go together but the patient said the health plex gym machines are spaced out well and there are no known exposures to COVID positive persons. Outcome of events was unknown.

An 87-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EN5318, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 01Feb2021 at a single dose as vaccine for COVID-19. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications.  On 01Feb2021 23:00, the patient experienced hallucinations. It was reported that patient started hallucinating on 01Feb2021 23:00 and just saw people but never heard voices. The reporter stated that her mom never had hallucinations ever. The patient feared people were in the house and stayed up all night (from 01Feb2021 23:00), slept all day (on 02Feb2021). The reporter wanted to know if they have ever heard of this happening. She has made an appointment with the patient&#39;s doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 87-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 01Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal, glaucoma, thyroid problems, mild cognitive impairment and memory problem. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin and carvedilol for blood pressure, donepezil for mild cognitive impairment, ezetimibe, levothyroxine for thyroid problems and ongoing latanoprost for glaucoma. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3246) on 11Jan2021 for covid-19 immunization. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had fallen, did not hit her head, but she has extreme fatigue, memory loss (she has seen some improvement now) unable to be by herself now and take her medications. The patient had a mild case of memory loss and had delirium. The reporter cannot say these events occurred from the vaccine of course. However, the work up that has been done has been negative and reporter was worried. It was reported that the patient had a little memory problem prior to getting the vaccine, however, now it was worse. It was like the patient cannot be alone now. The patient did not have a stroke. However, this like sent the patient over a cliff. This is a life changing event. If patient gets better it&#39;s all good, but if she does not they are in big trouble. Patient was previously able to care for self and now she was not able too. Patient underwent lab test (unknown result) in Feb2021. Patient was taken to Urgent Care, was seen by a physician and basic blood work was done and a urine test was done (unknown result). The outcome of event delirium was recovering; all other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

An 87-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization. On Sunday (28Mar2021), the patient had exacerbated symptoms of peripheral neuropathy throughout the evening with difficulty sleeping. Day 1 post-vaccination (Monday, 29Mar2021), the patient experienced extreme lethargy. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn.

The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression..&#34; She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn&#39;t get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that&#39;s the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn&#39;t know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight. The action taken in response to the event for gabapentin was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event &#34;Pain in arm&#34; was recovering, the outcome of the event fatigue was not recovered, the outcome of the events &#34;temperature 99.2&#34; and &#34;Vomiting&#34; was recovered, and outcome of other events was unknown.

This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number and expiration date unknown, first dose, intramuscular on 26Jan2021 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mastectomy, surgery for metaplastic carcinoma. She received 4 units of blood and reacted to the blood and itched from her head to toe and they treated her with prednisone for that. She said that the metaplastic carcinoma was 10 inches big and half of her front was removed. Other medical history and past drugs included allergic to Bactrim, Sulfa drugs, Cortisone, Zocor, Keflex, Macrodantin, Penicillin, Vicodin (took three times and thought she was going to die; coughed for a year and couldn&#39;t even sleep because she developed Pericarditis), Benazepril, Levaquin, Losartan, Niaspan (whole body turned red), Pravastatin. On 07Jan2021, she had an appointment with her doctor who first advised her not to take the vaccine because of all of her allergies but she said there is an antidote if she has a reaction so she said she could take it. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Jan2021 and had a bad reaction. She was very dizzy and got sick. They didn&#39;t catch it at the vaccination site because they only had the patients wait 15 minutes. Her drive home takes 10-15 minutes. She thought she couldn&#39;t drive home because of the dizziness. She got a tightness in her chest and started getting so dizzy that she ran into the living room and slept on the sofa because she couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. It was reported that she passed out from about 12:00-15:00. She was completely out.

The patient stated she has a whole list of allergies that she gave the other agent. The patient stated that she doesn&#39;t think she will take the second shot. She also stated she takes Tylenol after the Flu shot so she doesn&#39;t get so sick. The patient mentioned that her physician does not know about any of this and said that she received the vaccine at a hospital. She said that she only contacted her doctor to notify her that she was dizzy. She was directed to take Tylenol. She said that she did take Tylenol as directed by the people administering the vaccines too and she did get sick.

The patient said that the fact sheet said to call 911. The shot did not hurt her at all, and she did not know that she even received it. She said that the person who administered the vaccine was very good. The outcome of the event headache was recovering, dizziness, shortness of breath recovered on 27Jan2021, Tightness in her chest, passed out was recovered on 26Jan2021 and sick was unknown.

She did not know.&#34; The patient also had a fever a few times. The patient would go between shivering and really hot so she would take her temperature. The patient did not normally have a fever. When the shivering came on, she was trying to cook, and could not hold the spoon in her hand. The patient did not know what was wrong, but she was cold. All she wanted to do was sleep. The only symptom she still had was being tired. The night before the report, the patient woke up so warm and was sweating; her pajamas were damp. The patient could not sleep in them, so she had to go change. The patient has not shivered since then. The tiredness was persisting. The patient slept on and off all day today, but she was feeling better in general. The patient took her temperature every day. &#34;The highest her temperature got was 100.&#34;
