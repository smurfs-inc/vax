I didn?t feel well that afternoon sneezing because I thought it was nothing. As the week went on I started sneezing and coughing and stopped up nose. I always end up with sinus infection when I get a cold Dec 28 I went to the doctor at doctors care and they did a covid test before the doctor would see I tested positive.  I went home and rested, no energy, felt like I was hit by a train, couldn?t breathe, sneezed a lot and hardly coughed.  January 1, I called ambulance and went to hospital, I was sick the first week of January.  I didn?t know that you should wait 90 days to get the vaccine after you?ve had Covid.  After I got the vaccination the adverse reaction, I woke up during the night with my arm hurting bad and throbbing and a very large red circle appeared on my arm 2? in diameter. The next 3 days I felt like I had covid all over again, the 4th day I woke up and felt a little better and got out of bed and started making progress each day. Now I?m not good, but I?m ok.

                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

                                                headache; she had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient) via a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. This pharmacist reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 10:30 AM at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in jaw and headache. Concomitant medication included Tylenol for temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw. The patient (retired pharmacist) stated that she and her husband got the COVID shot on Tuesday (19Jan2021) and prior to getting the vaccine, she was suffering temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain in her jaw and took Tylenol that morning. Patient just came back from urgent care and was prescribed a dose pack of prednisone to take for 5 days for the TMJ and she is concerned about taking it because she knows it can suppress the immune system and she does not want to make the vaccine less effective. She was trying to figure out if she should just tough it out and not take the steroid. She and her husband, who was on warfarin, had a mild headache after the first shot but he has sinus issues and she had the TMJ, they were not sure if the headaches were from those things or the vaccine. Patient asked if she can take Tylenol since she found out that that may not have been a good idea. She was advised to take Prednisone and she was asking if she can take it or will it affect the efficacy of the vaccine. She stated not knowing that taking Tylenol can effect the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine, she had taken Tylenol before she received her COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 (Tuesday). Patient said her TMJ jaw pain was still a problem after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine, so she had gone to her doctor, and her doctor prescribed Prednisone, a corticosteroid. She said she was not going to take the Prednisone because she does not want the Prednisone to cause an issue with the efficacy of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said she then read that studies performed on children said that children that took Tylenol did not get as good of an immune response from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient said since she already took a dose of Tylenol for her TMJ jaw pain before receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, she was afraid to take any further Tylenol. Patient clarified that the Tylenol she took was the generic Equate brand, 500mg. She said she took 2 Equate brand generic Tylenol 500mg for jaw pain on Tuesday morning (19Jan2021) prior to getting her first COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she had disposed of Equate brand generic Tylenol bottle and cannot provide the UPC, Lot and Expiration Date. Reported that both her and her husband did have a headache all day long after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband believes his headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her headache was from the COVID-19 Vaccine or from her TMJ jaw pain. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she usually has a headache accompanying the TMJ jaw pain. Also reported that she always gets her vaccines in her left arm. Patient was surprised she and her husband did not have anything more than a headache after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said when she had the Shingles Vaccine, she could not lay on her left side for a week because her arm was so sore for 2 days, and when she had the flu shot she could not get out of bed for a day. Patient clarified she got her first dose of the Shingrix Shingles Vaccine in Nov2020, and does not plan to go and get her second Shingrix dose until the summer of 2021. Patient stated that she does not want the second dose of the Shingrix Vaccine interfering with the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient had headache on 19Jan2021, reported as mild. Patient also had a mild soreness in her left arm after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021, and the left arm soreness was gone in less than 24 hours. Patient further clarified that she had a headache before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her TMJ jaw pain acts up if she eats. She said when she has TMJ jaw pain, she gets an excruciating headache. She said she has no headache pain at all right no. Patient expected to have kind of a worse reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine based on what other people have been saying. The events were assessed as non-serious. Outcome of the event headache and mild soreness in her left arm  was recovered in Jan2021. Patient does not think her headache pain was related to the COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT162B2 to the event headache cannot be totally excluded. The underlying temporomandibular joint and headache may be cofounders.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082288 same drug/reporter, similar events, different patient

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELI283, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 11Jan2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she had her first vaccine on 11Jan2021. On 19Jan2021, the patient was feeling really bad, had a bad headache, general malaise and was feeling sick and nauseated. She was not feeling well and has not been feeling well the last 3 days. She thought the side effect would be right after getting the vaccine however hers started on 19Jan2021 (2 days ago). She stated she had an awful headache which she still has and had nausea. She wanted to know if it was normal to have happened this far away from receiving the vaccine, this amount of time from the vaccine. The patient reported that she is not quite as bad now, but she still feels it. The patient was worried it will not go away (Jan2021). The patient became frustrated and stated that she was just trying to find out if what she was feeling was normal. The patient also thought she had COVID and took a test in Jan2021 but she did not have COVID (negative). The outcome of the events &#34;not feeling well/general malaise/feeling sick&#34;, &#34;feeling really bad&#34;, &#34;a bad headache&#34; and &#34;feeling sick and nauseated/nausea&#34; was recovering; and the outcome of &#34;worried it will not go away&#34; and &#34;frustrated&#34; was unknown.

I didn&#39;t have diarrhea, but the feeling was very intense and I had to go to bed. I took Pepto Bismal, hoping it would alleviate the awful feeling. It wasn&#39;t like any other stomach or intestinal upset I&#39;ve ever had. It literally felt as though my insides were &#34;on fire&#34;, inflamed. The feeling persisted for 2 days and then went away. During that time, I just ate tea and toast and hoped that I wouldn&#39;t see any blood in my stool. It was very frightening.

Complete loss of energy...and I am a VERY energetic person.  Tiredness and light headedness has continued from 2/4 thru 2/13 with no let up. 11 hrs of sleeping at night after being on couch all day.  NO loss of appetite, taste, smell, fever, or aches.  Headache lasted only a few days.

                                                Immediately, within 2 hours of the vaccination, I developed a severe headache, join pain (knees, elbows, mostly legs and lower extremities) which evolved into intense, burning abdominal pain.  My blood pressure rose to 160; however, there was no fever, cough or shortness of breath.  This condition lasted until the 7am on the morning of February 8th, but pains returned that evening (Monday 2/8) through Tuesday morning.  Symptoms subsided during the day on Tuesday, yet on Tuesday evening (2/9, approximately 48 hours after the injection), severe symptoms returned, similar to the initial evening.  I visited my Primary Physician on Wednesday afternoon (2/10) for a consult.

Shot in the arm hurt 1 st day where a 1st doze shot did not hurt till next day, nausea,  weakness all  over and joints hurt.  I took1/2 of 2 percocets  1half every 3 hours for 12 hours and that helped with headache and teeth..tylenol did not help headache and I never have headaches.  I thought I was dying.  I spoke to friends who have had 2nd dose and most experienced some but not all and many nothing after 2nd dose.

Went back to bed.  6 am still hurt everywhere, short of breath (oxygen concentration at 90 and sometimes below--thankfully I had oxygen as I sleep with it).  Running a temperature of 100., disoriented, heart rate at 115&#43; and I hurt everywhere.  8 am called Dr. &amp; left call-back.  1 pm tried Dr. again.  Told person on telephone and he told Nurse Practitioner.  They ordered nose spray because I mentioned I may have a sinus infection as my head hurt, my ears hurt.  I continued Tylenol every 6 hours on Friday and Saturday (all day).  I was able to get up and do a few things on Saturday.  Felt better on Sunday but still weak feeling.  Oxygen saturation back to 95-96 and heart rate under 100.

                                                The first night after the vaccine had a headache and woke up with pain near her mouth.  The 2nd night, Tuesday, 2/16/21 it got bad, woke up around the same time early morning,  had pain on the right quadrant of her upper body, from her ear, eye, throat and down to right under her throat.  When she swallows the pain is very severe with difficulty swallowing and that pain radiates to the upper part of her chest.   Then on the third night, last night, all the same pain but the headache had disappeared.   Today, 2/18/21 she is still having the same symptoms.  The hardest thing to deal with is the ear pain in the right ear, and the pain under her right throat area.  She has taken one Benadryl at 8:00 AM, and will take another at 8:00 PM.  The Benadryl triggers her tinnitus so is limited with that.  Her daughter is trying to find OTC medicine for the ear.  She has not called her doctor as they are trying to treat it with OTC medicines.    For additional information call her daughter: who takes care of all her medical information.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

Got up about 2AM to go to the bathroom; started back to bed; had a bad taste in mouth, so decided to brush my teeth.  Started brushing and all of a sudden, felt faint; before I could get the toothbrush back, I fell and my husband rushed over. Said I was out completely; got me awake and back up and went to bed and slept. until 11am.   At 3pm when taking a shower, noticed my left shoulder blade was real sore and looked and there were 3 red strips below should blade - no bleeding tho.  top R. side of head kinda sore, so must have hit when falling. Went back to bed and slept good.  Didn&#39;t need to go to the Dr. and am feeling good now.  Just rested for a couple days.  Had been feeling really good and don&#39;t take any prescriptions, so could only think it had to have something to do with the shot. Today is the 4th day and feel good.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiry date: 31May2021) via Intramuscularly to left arm on 22Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Patient medical history included bladder infection, blood pressure, she has some old age stuff like blood pressure, and she had Thyroid removed and takes a thyroid pill every day and she tends toward GERD. Concomitant medications included she does take other medications, but they are not relevant. Patient previously took Shingles shot for Shingles (Had the first of the Shingles shot but it was before that. She is due for the second one but she is putting it off for the COVID second dose). Patient reported that she got the COVID vaccine and was really excited because seemingly, she had no side effects. The shot did not hurt. Ten days after she go the shot, she got really hot at night and really strong muscle and joint aches on 31Jan2021. She was up almost all night. It just kept waking her up. So, she took something, an Ibuprofen thing to reduce fever and pain. The next night she took one proactively and did not have pain. The third night, she had it again but it was a headache all night and she was hot on 02Feb2021. It only seemed to happen at night. She felt like it was from the vaccine. She was not worried she had COVID. She had no breathing problems and did not feel like she was going to pass out. They said she should wait 48 hours and take a test to see if she had COVID. She did and it was negative. She does not feel any negativity toward the vaccine. She went in for a bladder infection and it was from a doctor&#39;s appointment that she got information and they told her she could go ahead and get it. Since she got the vaccine, she got white bump in the vicinity of the vaccine like a while mole, and another in the vicinity of the area as well. It does not itch or hurt. She noticed it about a week after the shot. She does not know the date. She was still on medication for a bladder infection but it would not have done anything. When she had reaction to the vaccine, it was already 10 days after she got the shot. She had asked them at Kaiser, and they think it was unrelated to any other medication. Outcome of event fever was recovered on 01Feb2021, for white bump near injection site was not recovered and recovering for all other events.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                I think I am having a bad reaction to my covid shots.  The first shot was 1/31; a week later on 2/7  I started having headaches that travel around my head: some are behind my eyes and my teeth ache;  some more like migraines that go up the back of my head; some more on the top of my head or on the side.  My sense of taste changed.  My second shot was 2/27.  The day after I slept all day.  The headaches continued (I have had a headache of one kind or another since 2/7).  I had a tooth that broke off last June and was removed on March 8.  I thought the tooth was infected and part of the headache problems, but since then I have been having really bad fibro pain and for the week of 3/8- 12 I ran a fever, had chills and more headaches.  I was on amoxicillin from 3/8 to 3/14, but the tooth was not that badly infected and is healing well.  The headaches do not seem to relate to the tooth.  I have had a headache every day since 2/7 of various intensity and in different areas of my head.  I am extremely fatigued and need to nap some days.  My fibromyalgia symptoms are worse than they ever have been and some nights keep me awake.  I also muscle stiffness and spasms in my neck occasionally.  This is not normal for me. I saw a ARNP on 3/16 and she tested me for neurologic symptoms. Here are her notes:  NEUROLOGIC: negative findings: speech normal, mental status intact, cranial nerves 2-12 intact, gait, including heel, toe, and tandem walking normal, Romberg negative, muscle tone normal, muscle strength normal, rapid alternating movements normal, finger to nose normal, reflexes normal and symmetric   I have a video appointment with my primary care provider 3/26 to discuss this further

                                                headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This 76-year-old female consumer (patient herself) reported that she received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route in Left arm on 16Jan2021 being 02:34 PM (at the age of 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history and concurrent conditions included Blood pressure high started on 2009, Glaucoma, she had a car accident in 2009 where she got hit from behind that caused issues with her neck and she has this in her right eye, and her doctor put her on a new eyedrop in November, but other than that her meds stayed the same. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated that her husband and her took the first dose of the vaccine on Saturday 16Jan2021. She says she was fine Saturday, then she woke up on Sunday morning with a headache behind her eyes that was not bad but she noticed it most of the day and then at night it was behind her eyes, the top of her head, and behind her head on 17Mar2021 at 07:00. She says she has had headaches all last week, and she took Advil and Tylenol which sometimes helped. She says she finally saw her doctor last Friday on the 22nd because she felt that was a long time for her to have headaches as a result of a vaccine and her doctor had her do a CAT scan to be sure, since she is 76, to check if she might be having a stroke or something. She says she has continued to have headaches, though not as bad as last week, and she was reading the material they got at the hospital because they are supposed to have the second shot 06Feb2021. She says she would like to know, have they had people report having headaches that long. She says she took both Tylenol, clarified to being Equate brand Acetaminophen, and Advil. Equate brand Ibuprofen 200mg: She says she normally doesn&#39;t take Advil. Equate brand Acetaminophen: She says she has two bottles one of which she keeps in the bedroom, so she doesn&#39;t know which bottle her doses came from. She says both of the Equate brand Acetaminophen bottles are extra strength, 500mg. She says when she took these two medications she was careful not to overtake or take too much, but she can&#39;t really tell how much she took. She says she thinks she first took one Tylenol and one Advil, then later that night when it really bothered her, she thinks she took maybe two Advil&#39;s and one Tylenol, but she didn&#39;t write it down. She says now her headache is not nearly like it was last week. She says that she spoke to her doctor on Friday because she was starting to get concerned about it, but it was not unbearable all day long, she would wake up with it then take something, and during the day it was better, then at night it would be worse. She says this week it mainly bothered her that it was at the back of her head and neck area, since she does have problems sometimes with headaches at the back of her head after she had a car accident in 2009 where she got hit from behind that caused issues with her neck. She says she doesn&#39;t have sinus issues, so the headache behind her eyes was odd, and since the information said side effect, it is too big of a coincidence that she got the shot Saturday and she had a headache on Sunday. probably in 2009, and she started taking Amlodipine 5mg then, and then after she retired from teaching her doctor decided she didn&#39;t need it and she stopped taking it. She says she has been taking again since about a year and a half ago, in 2018 at the end of the year. Amlodipine NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown, it was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, it says use before 14Nov2021. Laboratory tests included CT scan resulted negative on 22Jan2021. The outcome of the event was recovering.

                                                She got the vaccine, when she came home she started feeling the fatigue that she felt after the 1st vaccine.  She then started feeling very cold, laid down and watched TV.  She then had chills all night and did not sleep well due to that.  When she got up on Tuesday the chills were gone but had a slight headache off and on throughout the day, her temp was 97.2.  Throughout the day she would get warm spurts/hot flashes, as well as fatigue.  She did sleep that night, and when she got up yesterday morning still had the hot flashes and it was 94.2, and took it twice due to it being so low.  She was like that with fatigue and not able to sit up.  She went to bed, took some Tylenol and rested.  The heat feeling it started going away.  Around dinner time she felt more like herself, the headache was gone and her temp was 97.  She was doing pretty good, and the last thing she had was she felt on her cheeks and noticed a rash on her face, like a prickly heat type rash.  Before she went to bed she put Neosporin on it, and when she got up this morning it was almost gone but still has a tiny few bumps.   The arm itself did not hurt at all.    Feels that it is a stressful situation as to where to get the vaccine and having to travel to get it as it&#39;s not available in locations closer to their homes.  The people at the pharmacy were great, but had to travel and if it wasn&#39;t for her daughter she would probably not have her shot.

                                                Last injection Jan. 28th. On March 15 I started with sore throat and my husband seemed to have head cold. On Tues. his job told him to get a COVID test. He went in Wed. and the rapid test was positive.  I went down hill.  I had headache, chills, sore all over, sore throat, coughing, shortness of breath, sore tongue, diarrhea, didn&#39;t have fever.  Was up Thursday night because of shortness of breath. Called Doctors office and was told to go to walk in clinic and someone would come out and get me.  Was seen by PA I think. Not a doctor. They only did a rapid test and it was negative. She didn&#39;t do the second test and send it off. I have found two people who had the rapid rest and results were negative that the results s Results sent in from second test came back positive. She prescribed Prednisone  which helped.  I was sick for over two weeks and still struggling with fatigue, aching , sore throat and shortness of breath.

A 76-Year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6199 and expiry date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 09Mar2021 at 01:30 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, at hospital and administered by a Nurse. Patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium, at 10 mg, 3x/day, (three days a week) and then at 5 mg, 4x/day, (5 mg four days a week); levothyroxine (50 ug) for Thyroid disorder and amlodipine besylate (2.5 mg) and had been taking fiber and probiotics. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number; EN5318, expiry date; 31May2021, Received in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization; Had no problem with first COVID-19 Vaccine. No pain at site, nothing. Patient stated that she had arrhythmia episode and that was unusual for me; Since then I have had four more episodes in Mar2021. Patient stated that her second dose of the vaccine at 1:30 pm. The same day at 10 pm, she experienced an impacted stool. She stated that she was on the toilet from 10 pm-12:15. She wanted to know if this is a reported side effect of the vaccine. After receiving second dose, patient stayed 30 minutes and felt fine. At 10 PM felt that need to go to the bathroom, which she thought was odd. More than two hours she tried to pass a BM. It was so impacted she could feel it all around her anus. Was ready to go to the hospital. Didn&#39;t know what to do. Waited and waited sitting on the toilet. Was trying to see if she could dig anything out and it was non-productive. At 12:15 AM bowel movement finally left. It was 13 inches long and 3 inches around. She actually tore and was bleeding really bad. She usually drinks a lot of water, but was not able to the day of the second COVID-19 Vaccine. It was stated that total time of bowel movement impaction was two hours and 15minutes (Began 10PM on 09Mar2021 and passed at 12:15AM on 10Mar2021). She was not supposed to push with bowel movement impactions. Patient was told by Doctor, patient could get a heart attack or stroke from pushing impacted bowel movements. Patient was so exhausted and a very bad experience. No further details provided. Had a lot of vaccinations over the time due to living in Honduras for 2 years and traveling in Brazil. No further details provided. Scheduled mammogram fourth months from second dose. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks or prior vaccination. She had a colonoscopy 6-8 months before the vaccine and had been taking fiber and probiotics. Outcome of the events impacted stool and Impacted bowel movement was recovered on 10Mar2021; for all other events it was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                is here today for ED follow-up on A-fib. Patient stated she is not taking Eliquis.    She had no side effects from her first COVID-19 vaccine. After the 2nd one she had muscle aches, headache, freezing cold, and &#34;weird&#34;, and felt really badly then at 9:30 PM, 32 hrs after the 2nd vaccine dose she felt the a-fib started. She had not been in a-fib in many years. Cardiology had already recommended eliquis but she was holding off. She had diltiazem from 2017 that she tried but with out relief. They rate controlled her but she remained in a-fib, started eliquis, and she went home. For 2.5 weeks she had headache and chest pain, other muscle pain, felt horrible, until she stopped the Eliquis.  Since stopping the Eliquis, she still has occasional mild chest pain, and headache, and flushing.   Her current chest pain is left chest, not radiating. The quality varies, stabbing pain in a very small location at times, may be associated with eating.   She did have a stress test years ago and was &#34;fine&#34;.   She had a dental appointment planned that she had to cancel, she has moved it to May 4th.

                                                On 2/16, a few hours after the second shot, I started to feel exhausted. For 2 days I slept about 17 hours total. When I got up, I coughed nonstop and wheezed. Codeine cough syrup did nothing. On Mar 5, I was no better, so I went to Urgent Care. They said I had an exacerbation of COPD, but I have never had COPD. They prescribed erythromycin, prednisone, and a Wixela inhaler. On Mar 15, my PCP, Dr. put me back on prednisone for 10 days and added 2 OTC asthma meds. Within 10 days I was much better. On Apr 5, I had some breathing tests that were normal.  I saw pulmonologist Dr. on 4/16. He said it might have been a vaccine reaction. I have never experienced anything like this before.

The patient stated that she got her second dose of the vaccine on 24Mar2021. She reported that after her first shot she was fine. She stated that she started having headaches and dizziness the day after her second vaccine and this had lasted for 14 days. It has gone on now for several weeks and was not getting any better. She felt her symptoms went in different degrees at different times of the day. She might go one day without a headache. Today her headache was more like a numbness all around her head. She stated that her headaches come and go, sometimes start when her eyes pop open in the morning or at 10 AM. If she was going to have a headache that day, it usually started by 10 AM and was a full-blown headache.

She was cold, shaking, then was tired, joint and muscles aching, and not wanting to move, just wanting to sleep.  No appetite.  She took a baby aspirin, the headache subsided but returned when the aspirin wore off.  She was out of it from Saturday to Sunday morning.  The headache was so severe and she took some Tylenol.  During the night she sweated so much that everything was drenched.  She had to get up and change her clothes again as she was wet from the chills, and urinating a lot possibly due to the water intake.  She feels much better than she did yesterday and Saturday but still having headaches, and not wanting the 2nd vaccine.    She did have COVID in July of 2020 and hospitalized 3 times during that time-frame.  She does not want to experience the same reaction.   She has an APT with her PCP coming up in May.   She was also diagnosed with the regular flu in  January and feels that she has the same symptoms if not worse than what she had experienced in the past.   She did have dizziness a lot and  had to use her walker to steady herself first.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscularly administered in the right deltoid on 30Mar2021 10:00 (Lot number: GR8732 or 6R8732 [as reported]; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure/hypertension; had breast cancer twice with the last time was in 2010 to unknown date which was 23 years later than the first time she had it (1987). She had infiltrating ductal cancer, stage one, that was HER-2 positive. She states that this is the most malignant breast cancer. She had to have extensive chemotherapy and also took Herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. The overriding symptom from her cancer was extreme fatigue; has been in chronic fatigue syndrome and in bed for 7 years, she was getting over chemo and she can barely walk. She has trouble walking long distances; had a mastectomy from 2010 to an unknown date without lymph node dissection; had a central node dissection; took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine; ongoing anxiety, depression and nervousness which is not new to her. She has had this on and off for the past year; and antihistamine that raises her blood pressure dangerously, it does not matter which kind of antihistamine whether it is Benadryl or over the counter. The only antihistamine that does not raise her blood pressure was a children&#39;s allergy medication. She took half of a children&#39;s dose. It did not raise her blood pressure, but it did not stop her itching. Family history included her mother&#39;s sister and she are very sensitive to medications. She has the same type of problems. As her mother&#39;s sister has aged, her problems have gotten better. As caller gets older, her problems are getting worse. Concomitant medication included carvedilol taken for blood pressure on unknown therapy dates. The patient previously took dupilumab (DUPIXENT) for skin conditions that having itching which she had side effects (Lot number: 0LU23A; Expiration date: Feb2023). Dupixent is a medication used for skin conditions that having itching, not cirrhosis, she cannot remember the name of the skin condition. Her skin started itching around Jun2020 or Jul2020. She saw eight different dermatologists. She found a doctor who was an itch specialist. Dupixent is the only thing that is going to work for her because antihistamines raise her blood pressure dangerously; and one time her doctor made a mistake, he ordered her hydroxyzine 25mg PO (Per oral). The doctor did not look on her chart to see her allergy list. She cut the pill in half and took half a dose. By the time she realized what she took, she was having so much itching. She woke up and felt like her head was going to explode and her blood pressure was 220/112. She took three tablets of her antihypertensive medication. She taken carvedilol 3.125mg. She did not even bother going to the hospital because by the time they would have saw her, and treated her, she could have had a stroke. The hospital is slow to treat people. Because she is a nurse practitioner, she knew that 3 tablets would be the correct dose for how high (Apr2021) her blood pressure was. She also previously took Benadryl but that raises her blood pressure dangerously. The patient reported that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine on 30Mar2021 and she had many side effects. She reported that the most predominant symptom is total exhaustion. For the first seven days after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was in bed for seven days nonstop. She placed a large grocery shopping order. She was able to get up and use the bathroom and cook small meals. She had someone come in to help her with the dishes, and to clean up the house. She talked to her internist of 20 years, and he told her to take the vaccine. Within five minutes, she started getting side effects. She inquired if it was safe to take the second dose of the covid vaccine. She has been so fatigued that she has been in bed for a 3 weeks-time frame and then her Blood pressure went up, it was 200 something, like 223/103. She went to the ER, and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room, and because she waited so long, she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She added that the second week after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine, she was able to get up every other day and go somewhere but the next day after she went somewhere, she was in bed all day and did not have complete energy (2021). She added that her refrigerator was going out, so someone drove her to department store 30 minutes away. She walked from the car, to the refrigerator section in department store, walked into the mall to get ice cream and then walked back to the car. By the time she got home, she immediately got back in her bed because she was so worn out. That was on Saturday. She was in bed all day yesterday. This morning, she feels better than yesterday. She thought about going to the store yesterday, but she knew she did not have the energy to go. Someone is coming later today to help her, and they will have to go to the store for her since she does not have any family nearby. She mentioned that the total exhaustion began on 31Mar2021. She took a wheelchair to the hospital whenever she received the first dose of the covid vaccine. She has trouble walking long distances. She called the hospital before she went, and the hospital did not have any wheelchairs she could use. The hospital cleared everything out of the way so they could fit the most patients as possible in the building. She had trouble walking the day that she received her first dose of the covid vaccine. Someone wheeled her in and out using her own wheelchair. She cannot go to the grocery store. Using a wheelchair is the only way she could have in and out. She could walk from her wheelchair into the examination room, and then after she went right back into her wheelchair. She is glad that she called because she does not know what she would have done without a wheelchair. It is hard for her to go on, sometimes she just feels like crying. Her trouble walking does not feel 100 percent, but it has gotten better. She is anxious, depressed and nervous also. Before her breast cancer, she had chronic fatigue. She could volunteer at a clinic for a few hours a week. She had radiation, and that caused exacerbation of her chronic fatigue. Her doctor told her that for some people, chemotherapy will make chronic fatigue better and that chemotherapy could help her chronic fatigue. Before she got chronic fatigue syndrome, she had a lot of energy. She used to work in an ICU that had 15 patients, with ambulatory patients on the outside. She worked six days a week then she transferred to a hospital where she took care of patients after they had open heart surgery. She used to be a very high energy person. Her exhaustion has gotten better, because she can get up every other day and leave the house. She cannot stop doing life. It is difficult for her that she cannot go to the grocery store. After seven days, she could go out every other day. Whenever she went to a certain company, she almost fell. Her legs got weak and she lost coordination on Tuesday (06Apr2021). Since then, it has happened a little bit here and there. It is almost like she is not sure when it will happen. In an instance, she can be working in the house, and her left or right toe will get stuck. This happens to her occasionally after chemotherapy. She noticed that her blood pressure raised after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine (Apr2021) and she takes medication (small dose of carvedilol) for hypertension. She takes her blood pressure medication every other day. Out of the past four days, her blood pressure has been elevated twice (Apr2021). If her blood pressure is elevated more than normal, her doctor prescribed for her to take an extra dose. Her blood pressure has not been elevated dramatically. She did take an extra dose of carvedilol because her blood pressure was within the scope of her blood pressure expertise. She went to the ER and the ER said her blood pressure was not bad (Apr2021), they put her in the waiting room and because she waited so long she just got up and left the ER. Since she is so tired and her Blood pressure is high, she has made an appointment with the doctor. She also stated that her blood pressure went up yesterday last night (18Apr2021), not right after getting the first dose. Last night at 6:00 PM, she took a nap and after she woke up took her blood pressure, she didn&#39;t feel anything in specific, she always takes her blood Pressure pill twice a day anyway. When she checked her pressure, it was 223/120 (Apr2021) and immediately took 2 Carvedilol 3.125mg and went to the ER, by the time she got there it was down significantly (Apr2021), but she is anxious and sat there and waited. They said they were going to do some blood work and an EKG but they left her there, so she decided to take a company home. Her Blood pressure has been up, she then went to sleep and after (Apr2021), it was 189/105, 183/105, and 165/95, she is a nervous wreck. She was ill for a long time, she had cancer twice, now she lives alone, she has been alone for all these weeks, her friends are here and there and come over. The Last 3 weeks she has been alone. She hired someone, but it was expensive. Now she feels hysterical (2021), after she saw her blood pressure, last night she was crying, and called the neighbor and they drove her right to the hospital then she was waiting in the ER for so long. She got her first shot on 30Mar2021 and she couldn&#39;t do anything in bed for 7 days, she is supposed to get the second shot tomorrow (20Apr2021) but doesn&#39;t want to be in bed again like that. She is anxious, depressed and nervous that began on 03Apr2021. During the week, she is distracted by the market. She has not been able to trade, because she does not trust her judgment right now. She did buy one this morning. Anxiety, depression and nervousness is not new to her which she has had this on and off for the past year. She has a lot going on. She needed to sell her two-story house and move to a one-story house that is easily assessable to healthcare and meals. She thinks this is disabling in face that she does not feel strong enough to make a decision. She cannot make a decision and she does not feel good enough too. Her anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue. She is experiencing awful symptoms. She went to the grocery store, and the stumbled and went into a company. She had to carry her milk and other items in slowly, and little by little. She thought this is awful, and she got into bed. She could not do anything. She mentioned that her illness is too much (2021). She was crying and she lives alone. The patient mentioned that the pain at the injection site began four hours after receiving the first dose of the covid vaccine. She received the vaccine at 10:00 AM then started getting really bad pain about 6:00 PM and then about 10:00PM or 11:00PM, it started to get unbearable. By 12:00AM (31Mar2021), the pain was so bad that she could not sleep because of the pain. She was in agony. She took took Tylenol and it did not touch her pain, but her pain got worse and worse, so she took three Tylenol tablets then they worked. She her friend and asked him to come over since she is afraid to take narcotics. She just laid there in bed and spent all night in agony. She tried a thing she put in the freezer and tried heat. She does not remember if either of those worked. The pain resolved about 2 days after. The patient declined safety report, saying that she is stressed and anxious (2021), she just wants to be transferred for her question. The reporter considered the events fatigue aggravated serious and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as medically significant. The outcome of the events fatigue aggravated recovering; as for the events blood pressure raised, &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39;, lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired were not recovered; while the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 01Apr2021 (reported as 2 days after). The outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, the events fatigue aggravated and &#39;anxiety, depression and nervousness was exacerbated by her terrible fatigue&#39; with seriousness criterion of disability while the events blood pressure raised lower extremities weakness of and coordination impaired as serious (IME).Based on the plausible temporal association and product safety profile, the reported events are possibly related to the vaccine BNT162B2. administration. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021) via unknown route of administration in right upper arm on 21Jan2021 at 11:00, at a dose of 0.3mL as a single dose for Covid-19 immunization in Hospital and received new refill of Mycophenolate mofetil, which is an immunosuppressant at a dose of 250mg, 2 capsules by mouth two times daily for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis on the same day (21Jan2021). Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity), kidney problem and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Jan2021, the patient experienced the dizziness, that started 10 days after the first dose of the vaccine and on the new refill of Mycophenolate mofetil and patient felt weird when she went for walk. On 01Feb2021, the patient was not feeling that great. Last Saturday (30Jan2021) and again today she felt some dizziness, felt weird, but did not think it can be blamed on the vaccine, or did that happen. She enquired whether that could also interact with the vaccine and had zero reactions until last Saturday. So, she wanted to check with Pfizer first and then with her kidney doctor. At that time, she was dizzy and could not shake it all that morning lone. Patient was on Mycophenolate mofetil for 2-3 years and it was a refill she just started on. With the timing right then with the dizziness wonders if related to the new batch she started that day. Unable to provide the NDC, Lot, or expiry for the Mycophenolate mofetil, but provided a discard date of 19Jan2022 from the white manufacture bottle and mentions (name) label over bottle. Mentioned that she does not take product as read on bottle it has been changed after discussion with the provider. Was using this prescription 2 in the morning and 1 at night and since she has been having the dizziness, she has switched to taking it 1 in the morning and 2 at night. Did read on the instructions that this can cause dizziness, but she had taken this stuff for over 3 years and was trying to figure out if it&#39;s a bad batch or not. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced headache and thinks she was shrunk and may have gained some weight. The outcome for the events dizziness, felt weird when went for walk, not feeling that great was not recovered and for headache, was shrunk and may have gained some weight was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EW0158) via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder (Deltoid Right) on 11Apr2021 in the afternoon around 14:00 or 14:30 (at 76-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. None history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2 considered as suspect. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for sinus disorder for years as needed. She took it the day before the COVID19 injection. She hasn&#39;t taken it since before getting COVID19 injection. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She didn&#39;t have the ones on the paper. They didn&#39;t say she would have severe throwing up she almost had to call. She was choking on 12Apr2021. She was over it currently. She first threw up on Sunday evening and then was ok. On Sunday (11Apr2021 21:00) she only threw up once, but it was four intervals. Caller clarified an interval was where she would throw up then clean up and then throw up again. Then it was fine. On Monday (12Apr2021), in the evening around 9 PM she started to spin. She went to the bathroom and she was heaving and she couldn&#39;t say how many times she threw up. Her throat was so swollen and it felt like she was choking. Her throat was very raw. Her uvula was so swollen that is why she felt like she was choking. She was about to go the emergency room, but then looked it up. She did treatment that she saw online for 3 days. When she was gagging and coughing she looked up COVID19 Vaccine and it said that her throat would be swollen from severe throwing up. It made a lot of sense. She had all the symptoms listed online and it said it would get better in five days and if not seek treatment. It has gotten better. No visit for ER and Physician Office. Treatment received for all events. The outcomes of the events were resolving.

                                                March 10, 2021 I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and the following day I experienced the predicted side effects of fever, chills, headache, fatigue and lack of appetite, which were all mild and I took Tylenol for the fever. The following day I was fine. After approximately two weeks I noticed there were subtle and unusual changes regarding my appetite, energy level an itchy rash on my back and a runny nose.  I didn?t pay much attention to any of these as they weren?t debilitating symptoms, but very unique for me. Then I realized I needed to pay more attention to these symptoms as they were getting more significant, except for the fact I didn?t have a fever.  Also my ears felt they were blocked.  I thought perhaps because of the feeling of blocked ears I may be getting a sinus infection although I haven?t had one in years. I called the doctor?s office on April 5th and I was told to go to the Urgent Care, which I did.  I was examined and given a prescription for a nasal spray, antihistamine and an antibiotic in case symptoms became more severe. It was also suggested that I may want to have a Covid test. I?m not used to taking any medications except for Trazodone, and was reluctant to take what was prescribed because if it was indeed a sinus infection it wasn?t in line with any I?d had years ago. I used the nasal spray for a few days and also the antihistamine. The headache got worse, and would move from one area of my head to another and also down the side of my face and neck. Tylenol didn?t help and Ibuprofen only helped now and again. The headache had a mind of its own. Warm compresses did help. I was in contact through the portal for recommendations from the medical staff.

Could not warm up, had two down comforters on. The chills eventually stopped but the headaches Intensified, also I could. Or move my near and shoulders. Went to the ER, they did not believe it had anything to do with the shot, I was there for 12 hours, had head exrays, spinal taps to test for meningitis, they searched for anything else I might have...nothing else.. they would not say if I should have the second shot, called pfiser this morning, they could not tell me if I should have the second shot, that I should aske my doctor.......If Pfiser  doctor  does not know if it is safe how could  my country doctor.

She was itching on her knee, leg, arm, neck, and ears. She stated she takes a lot of medications. She was very funny with medications and they have to work with her to get the right one for her. Due to having these other conditions was why she wanted to get the COVID Vaccine. She reported she will have her blood drawn next week. The two that had her most worried was the memory loss and chest pain. However, these passed and she did not go the ER or physician office. She was afraid if she gets the second injection this will happen again and she may not come out as well form it. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Outcome of events spasms/spasms were like in her back where her shoulders were and it was bulging and itching/itching on her knee, leg, arm, neck, and ears was recovering; chest pain was recovered on 14Jan2021 at 19:00; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.

                                                Had shot on 2/3/21 and on Thursday around 2.00am started to feel pressure in temple area.  It lasted until Wed ..one week like a vice on my temples.  Called Primary Dr. office and spoke to  PA.  She prescribed IMITREX for migraine but I took Excedrin with Caffeine and it did not help.  I have not taken the IMITREX because we&#39;ve had an ice storm and couldn&#39;t get it.  Wed my head felt much better...I was so happy..then last nite around 2.00am again it returned!  Not as bad as before but it still returned.

                                                One hour after receiving the vaccination, I had an uncontrolable bout of diarrhea in a public place. Later in the day, I felt  fatigued, and aching, and my left arm started to get very tight and sore. The next day I felt the same, and my lymph nodes under both my arms began to swell and hurt and my rectum began to have severe pain. Still had  diarrhea.  By day 5 my left arm ,at the site of the injection ,started to swell, get very hot ,and a large, bright red welt appeared which  almost reached my elbow and went across the width of my upper arm..  I called my doctor and went to see her on the next day because it had gotten worse.  She thought it was a local reaction and recommended ice, tylenol and benedryl. Again, as with the first shot, I am not sure if this is an allergic reaction or not., but thought I would report it.

The next morning my symptoms continued but did not worsen, and then I got so dizzy that I was stumbling.  This all continued for three days.  On 02/09/21 my symptoms subsided, and I felt normal again

I was fine with the first shot, and seemed fine with the second one until the next afternoon around 3:00 p.m.  All of a sudden I could feel some aching in the back of my neck and just a feeling of aching down my back.  Then I started to get the chills, chills that were so bad my body was almost convulsing with chills.  I ended up going to bed and I turned my electric mattress pad on to warm up.  I then slept very well and I don&#39;t think I moved all night.  I woke up sort of achy, but not much to be concerned with.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had anaphylactic shock in the past to a sulfur antibiotic. There were no concomitant medications. She stated she did not have an extreme reaction for the first 3-4 days, it was fine and went away. She had fatigue, joint pain, all the regular things and they were easing up. She had an appointment on the 20Jan2021 and thought things were going okay. On day 7, 20Jan2021, that night, she had an extreme reaction of blinding headache, the shakes, her whole body was shaking out of control for hours, her neck froze completely, and she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal (this is still occurring). The patient has had joint paint on 14Jan2021; extreme tiredness, weakness and muscle pain on 15Jan2021; chills, pain in her neck and muscles were so sore from 20Jan2021. She figured that was side effects, and she was handling, and then exactly a week after, she got the shakes so bad she shook for like 5 hours, she had to put nightguard in her mouth to stop from cracking, and severe headaches and her neck completely locked up, she couldn&#39;t move her head, and she still can&#39;t. She had extreme headache, and she went to the ER on 26Jan2021, since she was in really bad shape, they wouldn&#39;t believe her that it was a COVID reaction, she was there for 12 hours, they did every test, she had spinal taps, she had a head X-ray, everything, as they said she had meningitis, but then ruled that out, they wouldn&#39;t believe she was having a reaction to the COVID shot, she can&#39;t move her head, her joints and that are ok otherwise, but she can&#39;t move her head, she has pain in her neck, and she is taking Excedrin for that. She stated her doctor told her to go ahead and take the second dose of the vaccine and just take Tylenol after. She stated Tylenol has no effect whatsoever. If she takes Excedrin the headache will go away and Tylenol won&#39;t budge it. She stated she is taking Excedrin regardless of what the doctor says. When asked for age of onset, states she was on Valium and she was not thinking straight, and asked her husband her age. She was not sure why it was given, now provides name as Diazepam 5mg. Muscle pain is fine now, it went away. She went to the doctor on 20Jan2021, as she had a regular appointment for bloodwork to be done, and said she felt pretty good, she had some reaction but was fine, and that night is when she got shakes and shivers so bad, she had 3 quilts on and couldn&#39;t warm up, her body was out of control, she couldn&#39;t stop, now states for 3-4 hours. Severe headaches started the night of the 20Jan2021. Her neck pain started right after the shakes, so maybe she pulled muscles when she had the shakes, the muscles were so sore, and she couldn&#39;t move her head, like down or to the side, she couldn&#39;t move it, which is why she went to the hospital, to the ER. She was there for 12 hours. She started taking Excedrin, states she ignored what the doctor told her. She knows her body and she can take Tylenol and Ibuprofen like it is candy, and it does nothing, one Excedrin puts everything away, she swears by Excedrin. The outcome of the event shaking recovered on an unspecified date; Joint pain and Muscle pain recovered on 19Jan2021; Blinding headache/ severe headache, Fatigue/Extreme tiredness was recovering, chills/ shivers, couldn&#39;t warm up, Neck froze completely, pulled muscles, fatigue was unknown; she can&#39;t move her head up and down normal/ couldn&#39;t move her head, Pain in her neck, Muscles were so sore, Weakness was not recovered.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 27Jan2021 13:50 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine due to her age and she was due for it. Medical history included fractured ankle. Pateint&#39;s height was five two and shrinking. She is on (networking site) with people she went to high school with and they are all getting the shot at same time because of their age. They were all saying they have had no side effects and no symptoms. There were no concomitant medications. The patient read the information they gave her after the shot. Now, she knows why she has felt so stupid. It was all the stuff on the list. On 28Jan2021 about 19:00, she had a day and a half of diarrhea and she was having chills occasionally. On 28Jan2021, she felt totally exhausted. A little bit of everything. She was not nauseous. On 29Jan2021, she has been able to eat, but nothing tasted that great. Even when her son got her what she wanted it still did not taste great. She is coming off a fractured ankle and she is going to have cancel therapy because she doesn&#39;t feel well enough to do that. She got the first vaccine on 27Jan2021. It will be a week on Wednesday. On Thursday and Friday she had diarrhea. Serious quantity of Pepto Bismol kept that at bay. The exhaustion has only improved a little. It was good for her to get up and move.  No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the event diarrhea was recovered on 29Jan2021; events chills and exhausted was recovering; event &#39;she has been able to eat, but nothing taste that great&#39; was not recovered; and unknown outcome for the other events.

(injection given at 1452) The doctor suggested heat/cold, anti-inflammatory,  brace and finally an x-ray which indicated nothing.  Four days after the second injection I&#39;ve experienced mild pain in my opposite thigh and fatigue. The second injection was given in the opposite arm (left). While chatting with others  in recovery after second injection about knee pain, another woman said she was experiencing the same and thought it was her arthritis but it felt different.

A 77-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284; expiry date: unknown) , via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 18Jan2021, at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ear problems in the past and sick. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID shot on 18Jan2021. By Wednesday, two days later (20Jan2021), both ears were messed up, she was running a temperature (also reported as low-grade fever), had a headache, and was very nervous. She went to the doctor and her doctor gave her an antibiotic shot, two steroid shots, and some antibiotic ear drops, which did not work. She then did a home call with the doctor and she provided more steroids, an oral pack, and an oral antibiotic for 5 days. She was still having problems with her ears. Mainly her left ear. It goes from ear to ear. She went to the ENT about the earaches which turned out to be infected, and has subsequently been on two rounds of antibiotics, with persistent symptoms that have gotten better over time. Patient wanted to know if this could relate to the COVID Vaccine. She has never had this happen before, and she has been really sick but not this bad. She has had ear problems in the past, but normally the antibiotic liquid drops clear it up. It was like a chronic ear ache. Her earaches were hurting bad. What she is wondering is if it could be a side effect from the first COVID shot. She clarifies that her ears are swollen on the inside. It was an infection somewhere. The antibiotics and steroids have not healed it up. All of these events were still occurring but come and go. For instance, yesterday she had a low temperature but has not yet had one today. The antibiotic ear drops prescribed were Neopoly HC OTSC 1% OTIC SU. NDC: 24208-635-62. Expiry date: Jun2022. She was unsure what the lot was but also sees: 349111. The oral antibiotics she has is Amoxicillin 875mg/125mcg. These are in a pharmacy vial. Use before: 26Jan2022. She was given two steroid shots. One shorter acting and one longer acting. She was unsure of the names. Oral steroid pack: Manufactured by Pharmaceutical name. Prednisone USP 5mg. REV 1016. 314518. lot: 1150419. Expiry date: Feb2022. She also pre-treated with allergic reaction medications. She goes back to the ENT on Thursday. Patient wanted to know if these had happened to anyone before. Outcome of the event pyrexia was unknown, for events ear swelling, ear pain and ear infection was recovering, while for the other events was not recovered.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

She felt like, she has never had a hangover but it felt like she had a hangover, that was what it felt like, and she thought she hopes that doesn&#39;t last and she got up Wednesday morning (Jan2021) and went to her podiatrist appointment. She didn&#39;t feel good but she was okay so she went to the podiatrist and then later she was fixing supper and she had some grease in a pan that she fried something in and she thought she wanted to get some water in it so she went to go with the pan and she got to the door and took 3 steps back and she thought good Lord, there is something is wrong here. She did empty the water and the grease and she thought well it is going to have to stay there, it was right at the back door so anyway. Her son came home from work and she got him get the blood pressure cuff and take her pressure and it was 158/98 and she thought, this was not good. She said she will just go lay down for a while and she went on to bed. The patient was taken into the hospital via an ambulance. She sat there until about 4-5 hours and later they got to take her blood pressure and result was 189/92 on Jan2021. They gave her some IV because she was dehydrated and she got home, she lives about 30 miles form the hospital so they got home about 3 o&#39;clock and next day she didn&#39;t feel good but she felt better. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital it was an ER visit and they sent her home. She felt Thursday was not a good day she came down off of what had her up. She was going to say no to the second dose because she was sick on her stomach and drunk as a dog, she was really dizzy, very dizzy and she just had to sit down quiet her self. She was supposed to have surgery but because of COVID it has been cancelled 3 times. The outcome of the events were unknown.

And then I got up to leave and I felt like I was going to pass out (15Feb2021). So, I sat down in the chair, my husband asked for the nurse and she came and she thought it was my diabetes which I also sort of felt that, but anyway I came home and I felt unwell (15Feb2021), that afternoon and then the next day, I would feel like that and then the next day I had improved but I started with this jerking and that has been going now since then but today it&#39;s more like (incomplete sentence). At first, it was like small and now they are getting big like a jerk. I called my family doctor yesterday and I talked with the nurse and she told me that I needed to be checked within 4 hours. So, I went to one of the in and out you know places, emergency places that you can go to and she took a lot of blood, and ones that came back were okay but the other results, she is not going to get until tomorrow, I have to go back. But have you have anybody else that has had this experience?&#34; The date when adverse event started was reported as &#34;Started out, it was like a little twitch on Wednesday night that would have been from Monday to Wednesday and then today it&#39;s just like a jerk, it&#39;s big. My whole body is just jerking. I did not feel well the afternoon I had it. But the next day, I thought I was better and that is when the twitch started.&#34; The patient was experiencing event worse than ever. It&#39;s like a bigger jerk now. No treatment was received for the events. Lab test: &#34;They took 5 vials of blood yesterday when I went to that doctor, and I heard for some of it, but for the rest, I will have the results tomorrow and I just had my blood drawn on Thursday from my kidney doctor. So, I have blood drawn all the time.&#34; The outcome of the event &#34;felt like I was going to pass out&#34; and felt unwell was recovering, and &#34;it was like a little twitch and then today it&#39;s like a jerk, it&#39;s big/whole body is just jerking&#34; was not recovered.

A 77-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm on 01Feb2021 at 09:10 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included breathing problems and COVID-19 on 31Oct2020 in which she waited exactly 90 days to get the vaccine. The patient had a small touch of pneumonia on her lower lobe of her right lung, she was on a lot of antibiotics and a strong herbal solution. She was on one antibiotic for 5 days and another for 7 days. She was on the herbal stuff for 7 days. She took all that stuff and was drinking lemon juice and hot water and breathing in lemon scent and Vicks Salve all in her nose. She also was prescribed an asthma pump. She had all that stuff going into her system. She also was tested, and she has H. Pylori bacteria. She explained her whole family must have that, it&#39;s hereditary. That wasn&#39;t her issue. However, all that she put in her stomach and in her system caused her to have stomach issues. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick. She told the person administering the vaccine that antibiotics made her sick and she was told it didn&#39;t matter and that this wouldn&#39;t interfere with the COVID-19 vaccine. Her stomach was all messed from all that stuff. The patient also has anxiety. She has never been treated with anxiety. She has had anxiety since she was a very young women and she has never been treated for it. When probed for any product information she had available for the medications that messed her stomach up and made her sick she provided the following information: The first medication she took was azithromycin (Z-PAK, lot number: KG0706, expiration date: Nov2021, NDC number: 0781-8089-26) that was dispensed in a little box. Dose was 250 mg which she took daily doses for 5 days. One of the doctors gave her a levofloxacin 50 mg for 7 days. She was given the pump, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL SULFATE HFA INHALATION AEROSOL, lot number: 102B4, expiration data: 20Jan2022) 90mcg per actuation. She explained she only took this once. She was so scared from this stuff. It squirted down her mouth. Another doctor prescribed her omeprazole 40 mg capsule every day because she told him her stomach was messed up. The patient was prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet, by mouth three times daily for 14 days and clarithromycin 500 mg tablet, take one tablet by mouth twice daily for 14 days. The new doctor also had her taking omeprazole (the doctor wrote another prescription for this). However, this time the dose was 20 mg and she was prescribed to take that twice daily for 14 days. She didn&#39;t finish this medication. She told the doctor that antibiotics made her sick and the doctor explained because of her bacteria, she ordered the antibiotics to make her feel better. The patient told the doctor if she could live like this, let her not take these medications until she gets her stomach better and she would eat healthy food and find natural antibiotics at the health food store. She mentioned using oregano. She took that once a day. When she knew she was getting ready to take the COVID-19 vaccine, she stopped taking that 2 weeks before taking the vaccine. She stopped taking cholesterol medicine at night 2 weeks ago, it was making her sick to her stomach. She stopped her potassium medicine. She didn&#39;t want any of the medicines interfering with the vaccine. The patient also took an herbal medicine that was called a Spiritual, Mental, Emotional, Elevation Science of Eternal Life. It&#39;s a detox mixture that was very strong. She took this for 7 days. She had lost weight because she was not eating. The patient has always been a junk food eater. She quit eating junk food and that probably also had something to do with her being sick. She cooks all her food. There was no additional vaccine administered on the same date with COVID-vaccine. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She has never had a flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine or shingles vaccine. This was her very first vaccine. Concomitant medication was reported as none. The patient didn&#39;t know if it was anything serious, but she tried to read all the information that was given to her. She was looking at the information and she saw &#34;if you have any difficulty breathing&#34;. That was the only one that she was having. She could breathe better moving around but when she sits down, her breathing seems to be congested. She was calling to see if this was anything serious and if she needed to go the emergency room. Since her breathing has been acting funny, she has been trying to keep moving around. She was cleaning her bathroom and the Bleach Cleaner and other cleaner opened her nose. She was listening to a town hall meeting and when she sat down to listen to it, her nose started stuffing up again. She has just been trying to get up and move around. Since she has been talking on the phone, her breathing was a little better. Her nose just swells. She got up and was beginning to eat breakfast when all of a sudden, the difficulty breathing started happening. It was around 8:45 am this morning (02Feb2021). It has improved, but when she would sit down, it would tighten up and she would have congestion in her chest. Since she has been moving around talking, it has gotten better. Sitting down has something to do with the difficulty breathing. She has had breathing problems before. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, 01Feb2021. She sat for half an hour afterwards and then came home. She then slept all night and stated her arm was sore on Feb2021, but it was feeling better. She also had a little pain in her right leg on the side she received her vaccine on Feb2021, which was currently gone. She wasn&#39;t sure if the breathing problems were from the vaccine or something else. The patient did not go to the emergency room or visited his physician in response to the events. She mentioned that if this continues, she probably will go to urgent care. The outcome of the event dyspnea at rest and respiratory tract congestion was recovering, recovered on Feb2021 for pain in extremity, and unknown for all other events.

A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Batch/lot number: EM9801), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, first dose on 04Feb2021 (Administered between 9:30-10:00AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath. She said it was cold outside by her nephew&#39;s graveside, but she felt she had to fan herself like she was overheated. She said her heart rate was flying, and she had an irregular heart beat. She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell. She said she was tested the Friday before her nephew&#39;s funeral and was negative for the COVID-19 Virus. She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her. She said when she looked down at the label, she saw an IV access was put in her arm.

After 12 hours the fever gradually subsided as did the pain in my neck and shoulder. Was left with headache that remained overnight but the pressure was not like the day before. Saturday I was just tired, I think from the fever, but by the evening I was back to normal.

The next day she was more lethargic, coughing.  Called her PCP, recommended Robitussin and Mucinex which she took.  Continued to feel worse.  No fever although she had cold sweats.  She felt a lot of GI pain, fullness, could not eat/drink.  Called PCP again by the 4th day of feeling bad.  Recommended Augmentin and she took 2 doses.  On 3/12 and 3/13, had difficulty breathing, coughing.  Called EMS on 3/14 and taken to hospital where she was treated for dehydration and pneumonia with a broad spectrum antibiotic and vancomycin, IV.  Given morphine for pain.  She tried to take a  GI cocktail which she felt like she was choking on. That evening on her BP bottomed out.  They continued to give IVFs to raise BP as fast as possible. She was unable to receive chest compressions due to aorta issue and her heart gave out and she stopped breathing on 3/14.

                                                Rapid onset of fatigue following 15 minutes post observation time, guest sat in chair and notified staff (11:42). Took her own prescribed carbidopa prescription as she stated she was due for a dose and that fatigue is common feature of her Parkinson&#39;s and that she usually feels better 20 minutes after medication. She then reported shortness of breath that felt &#34;different&#34; than her usual shortness of breath so internal aid was called for. EMT staff assessed guest to find vital signs stable and able to speak full sentences. Guest reported feeling better at 12:15 and was moved by wheelchair to her ride to go home.

                                                Chills; aches and pains; chest spasms; a fever a little shy of 101; hard to breathe; feel ill; activated all that discomfort; she thought she was having a heart attack; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for herself. A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                March 12, 2021 - On Friday about 2pm, I started with a runny nose ? by Sunday afternoon it was like a faucet turned on ? running down my face. March 13 - Saturday morning, I started coughing c chest congestion, and had Phlegm rattling in my chest, started sneezing very frequently/ some diarrhea.  Otherwise, I felt fine. March 14 - Sunday morning, I started wheezing slightly, coughing more and sneezing frequently.  Felt fine.  Went shopping.  Nose ran so much in store, had to run to the store to get paper towels to catch it.  Later, when I carried a heavy bag of groceries from one car 12 feet to another, noticed I was very exhausted and had to rest about 15 minutes before driving home.  Wheezing more. Monday, March 15, I took my B/P meds at 1:00am and my blood pressure was way up x 4 (160?s/ 70?s) p58-64,  at 2:08am ? B/P was 183/92) so I took my PRN Clonidine and ate all the high Potassium foods I had in the house.   By 3:40am my B/P was 120/66 but went back up later with coughing.  I felt fine but tired. A little after 4am,  I carried a bag of apples and a bag of oranges up my stairs and was totally exhausted ? I felt the energy draining out of me, and so was out of breath I dropped the bags on the floor and  sat hyperventilating to get enough air in my lungs until I could breathe normally ? for 40 minutes -  it felt like fluid building in my lungs.  I started massaging my abdomen like crazy and coughing until it subsided ? considering whether I should go to E.R.  My breathing did get some better But I sure did not exert myself.  Just picking up my computer was taking my energy. Still coughing and getting rid of some phlegm.  This was very scary and I was on the verge of going to the E.R.   at 4:45am - I called the E.R. who said I probably could wait for a urgent care to open or talk to Dr.?s office.  My breathing was some better.  By 6:10am I was so tired I fell asleep.   At 10am my B/P was 138/77 p53.  Still very weak, coughing, wheezing, and trying to get rid of phlegm. I had no other symptoms.   I called my Dr. who got me in a urgent care in her building at 3pm.  That evening I started Postural Drainage which helped in getting rid of the phlegm.  I have continued that still. March 16 ? I ?chatted? my doctor to let her know all that was going on.  She scheduled me to see the Respiratory office in her building on the next day.  I was feeling much better ? little nasal dripping, lungs felt better,  March 17 ? Wednesday ? went to Respiratory appt but declined treatment because I felt so much better. More energy, better lungs than Tuesday, wheezing gone, less phlegm, still some coughing ? which is okay with me.  I think this is a severe enough reaction that I should not have the second dose ? which is known to be more severe than the first.

A 77-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 25Jan2021 (vaccination age 77 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

She is &#34;so weak&#34;; she &#34;can hardly speak&#34; and &#34;can hardly function&#34;. When she &#34;lays down&#34;, her &#34;heart is racing so fast and [her] BP gets so high that it won&#39;t let [her] sleep&#34;. She feels like her &#34;body is going crazy&#34;. She &#34;cannot get more than 2-3 hours of sleep other than 1-2 exceptions&#34;.  Also, her &#34;BP wakes her from a dead sleep&#34;.  When she wakes up, she usually &#34;takes a rice [pad] and applies hot and cold to her neck, and she sometimes takes some Tylenol&#34;. &#34;Every time [she] wakes up, her BP [readings] are around 152/101 and 160/97. She has been in and out of the hospital for her high BP.  After the hospital, she called (Number) because her BP &#34;was off the chart&#34;. Her cardiologist ruled out heart issues. She did an &#34;echo, a stress test and EKG&#34;.  On 01Feb2021 she was admitted to hospital with 200/103 blood pressure. Ruled out cardiovascular &amp; placed on Amlodipine. Now 37 Days later with many visits to doctors, blood pressure remains high. Cardiologist ran stress test &amp; echo with no heart issues. Placed on many Blood Pressure Medications that also created side-affects (urination, flushing, dizziness, extreme headaches); Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol 25 mg, Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, Propranol 20 mg. Today, picking up yet another (Hydralazine?) as last-ditch effort. BP daily spikes remain high (160/99 and 175/100). Racing Pulse &amp; BP wakes me out of a dead sleep within 1-2 hours.

She specified the headache and pain were so bad it lasted for 1.5 hours, and her BP was 150/93 at 3 am .She added she had a &#34;red and flushed face&#34; and therefore took a &#34;Benadryl at 4am&#34;.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

                                                allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine; 1st dose last 22Jan2021 - 2nd dose was on 08Feb2021; 1st dose last 22Jan2021 - 2nd dose was on 08Feb2021; doesn&#39;t feel good; one heck of a temperature; By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine/ That&#39;s what she was afraid of; redness and swelling in her right arm; redness and swelling in her right arm; feeling hot all over the body; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 77-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included weakened immune system because of the alcohol allergy (started while 19), and aches and pains. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (expiry date May2021) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 77 years old last 22Jan2021 administered on the upper righthand arm later clarified as upper right arm; and she was still going through that systemic reaction when she had her first COVID vaccine. The patient asked on regarding how effective the vaccine was related to receiving steroid therapy. Patient was advised by doctor to go to urgent care to have a covid test to see if she and husband were exposed to covid before the vaccines kicked in.  Patient stated that on an unspecified date in 2021, she still didn&#39;t feel well and was running one heck of a temperature (increased). Patient reported she had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. She filled out the forms. Patient felt like she should be put in the hospital. She has a horrific allergy to alcohol. Each time she receives an injection it gets worse. She knew when she received the second dose that the third ingredient was alcohol. She thought about was worse, the virus or the reaction. Within a minute of taking the vaccine she had a reaction. She reported it at the site and was watched for a half hour. Her question was &#34;because she took prednisone immediately after getting the vaccine does that negate the shot?&#34; She was not asked the name of the steroid that she took. She was taking prednisone 20mg, 2 tablets as soon as she gets a shot then 2 daily Monday-Friday. It was still going through her system and it was reeking havoc on her. If she goes to the hospital they will give her Benadryl and monitor her. Patient stated that on 08Feb2021, she had an allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine. Patient stated that she had both COVID shots and had adverse reactions and took some medicine for the adverse reaction and now the patient was concerned it might mess with the shot, it might not work for her as it should. She knew that this was going to be a long process and she knew her allergies were rare, but they were there. She is allergic to isopropyl alcohol, even if it is in shampoos or liquid soaps, she gets reactions. She had her first COVID vaccine and she had her own hospital cleanser that she has with her at all times and she used it which was not a problem. For her second COVID vaccine, the nurse was naming the 3 ingredients that were in the COVID vaccine and asked if she was allergic to any. She said this last shot had alcohol in it, she sat with her husband next to her, and thought which was worse: getting COVID, the cases in the city are high, or having a reaction to the alcohol. She chose the latter. When it went into her arm she immediately knew she was getting a reaction. She had steroids with her just in case this happened. Each time the reaction happens, it gets worse. She said she sat for half an hour and has been on steroids until last Friday. She was supposed to be on them for days. On Friday, she was wondering if taking the steroids negated the effectiveness of the COVID vaccine and that&#39;s why she called in. She knew that this was rare and it was not something that the company going to say that the company know how to fix it. Patient worked in the health unit of a university as a hiring and firing people person. So, she was around it, but she was not a doctor or a nurse. So, she guessed the answer was no. Last week she received her second COVID vaccine. She said, she has got to get rid of 5 pounds, but it&#39;s harder to do that when you&#39;re older. She experienced the reaction from the isopropyl alcohol within her second dose of the COVID vaccine last week, 08Feb2021. She said she was still going through it and will for a while. When asked for the outcome, she said she couldn&#39;t answer that honestly. She said she didn&#39;t feel good (2021). Period. She knew that when she goes through this it takes, each time, an extra 4 to 5 days to get over it. When she got up this morning, she didn&#39;t feel good. Her husband asked if she wanted to go sailing, and she said not in 30 degree weather, but for her to say no to sailing, her husband knew she didn&#39;t feel well. She couldn&#39;t say worse, but she can say she didn&#39;t know how long it was going to be, which was scaring her. By doing what she did, if that negated the COVID vaccine, then lets go from there. That&#39;s what she was afraid of. When she tells people she is allergic to alcohol, and when it happens, they look at her like &#34;nobody is allergic to alcohol.&#34; She is 77 and has the aches and pains of a 77 year old, which she hates. But she doesn&#39;t think there are related medical conditions to what she experienced. This (allergy to alcohol) started when she was 19 and it has gotten progressively worse. So she tries to be careful. She says this was her, not dumb, but her decision that she made and now she is concerned.  She said no to any tests done. She had the immediate reaction and she knew what to do. Patient further reported that she has allergy to alcohol and had an adverse reaction after the 2nd shot due to alcohol swab and on an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced redness and swelling in her right arm and feeling hot all over the body. Patient asked if her doctor will prescribe Benadryl to manage my allergy will it affect the effectiveness of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The patient did not recover from the event &#34;allergic response to isopropyl alcohol in second dose of COVID vaccine&#34;. The outcome of the other events reported was unknown.

The concomitant medications were not reported.  on an unspecified the patient experienced atrial fibrillation (AFIB), tachycardia, chills, lethargy, brain fog, felt like i had a cold spent 2 days feeling like that, hypersensitivity. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of AFIB, tachycardia. The  outcome of events was unknown.   The course of events was as follows: On an unspecified she had reacted to the first vaccine: the first day she was fine. The next day she had chills, lethargy, kind a brain fog, felt like she had a cold and spent 2 days feeling like that. On Day 3 she had AFIB and tachycardia for 3-4 days saw the heart doctor and got medicine for that. She had a temperamental immune system. The stress test was super important. She was wandering if she had the Pfizer vaccine a week after the stress test. She got it at the university, and she wandered if they were restricted to give it to her a few days after my scheduled date: They wanted to rule out blockage in her heart.  She was having a test done around the same time as the 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She wanted to know if she could get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine later/ a week after the stress test. She wanted the vaccine, it was important. On 04May21 she was going to have a dye based test checking your heart, a stress test. The stress test was scheduled the same morning as her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She was advised to consult with your doctor or pharmacist for further guidance.

This 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EW0171), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies and sinus headaches which she takes (Excedrin) off and on for years in the past, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included atenolol (manufacturer unknown) taken for hypertension, start and stop date were not reported. Past drug history included the patient received a flu shot (unspecified Flu shot) with a mega reaction she was sick for weeks which was at least probably 15-20 years ago So, she never got a flu shot after that and she has never had the flu. On 29Apr2021, the patient had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, dizzy/light headed, felt like I am going to faint, and ringing in the ears. On an unspecified date in 2021, she experienced allergic reaction. On 01May2021, she was really ill, and her blood pressure went up over 220 and pulse rate went way up. On 02May2021, she experienced headaches. On 06May2021, she was feeling a little weird and nauseous. On an unspecified date in May2021, her memory is a little off right now. The clinical course was as follows: the patient reported, &#34;I had a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine, it&#39;s okay now, I couldn&#39;t really move it. I feel I may be having a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine) got on Thursday (29Apr2021) of this past week. I am very light headed, dizzy and felt like I am going to faint, has ringing in the ears, and all that has been going on about a week, since last Thursday (29Apr2021). Then I was really ill last night (01May2021). It started last night when we went to bed around 11 O&#39;clock. I have never had anything like this in my life. My blood pressure was through the roof. With a blood pressure cuff and a stethoscope, her blood pressure went up over 220 which was so high that had never happened before, so I took an extra pill (atenolol 25 mg tablet) last night (01May2021) which helped a little bit but not enough, and I really thought that I was going to pass out and be really sick. Because I thought that it was either having a stroke or a heart attack, my husband had to call ambulance to take me to the hospital last night. The systolic and diastolic and pulse rate went way up.  They did chest x-ray, blood work, and urinalysis, and everything came back fine and they could not find anything. They just felt that I was just having a major reaction to the shot so they sent me home. I just got home this morning (02May2021) from having to go to the emergency room. But as soon as we got home, I started with a humongous headache and so I had Excedrin/Tylenol for headaches because I used to get sinus headaches. So, I took that, and it helped a little bit, my headache got a little better. Anyhow, I am much better right now and I am sleeping. But tomorrow it will be the same.&#34; Later the patient also reported, &#34;Today (06May2021) I am feeling a little weird with ringing of ears and is light headed sometimes. Because of the light headedness, I feels a little nauseous. But I am a still very nauseous. I feel like I am going to faint again and my blood pressure I think has gone back up. I am trying to keep calm and trying to figure out what is going on. But I am really afraid if I am having a reaction to the vaccine unfortunately. I am dizzy and I do not want to start getting worst again. I guess I will feel better if you tell me that this happens sometimes and what can I do to decrease somehow?&#34; She also stated that she did contact her doctor about this event but she didn&#39;t get very far. Her memory is a little off right now because she really has not felt well. She stated that her biggest thing is her blood pressure. She also stated, &#34;The only thing that I am really concerned now is about getting the second shot because I already had the reactions by the first shot. Am I going to face the same thing or even the worse with the second shot?&#34; Treatments were received for her blood pressure went up over 220 and headaches. The clinical outcomes of the event &#34;a really really sore arm for two days after the vaccine&#34; resolved on 01May2021, the event nauseous was not resolved, while the events, allergic reaction, really ill, felt like I am going to faint, pulse rate went way up, ringing in the ears, dizzy/light headed, Headaches, feeling a little weird and memory is a little off right now were unknown.

The doctor told her, that if she had any eye tearing, nasal drip, or other things like that, to take a Benadryl. Caller waited 12 hours, because her eyes did start to tear, and she was sneezing and so she took a non-drowsy Benadryl, but she waited 12 hours to take the Benadryl, because she didn&#39;t want it to interfere. The patient experienced fast heartbeat started in the evening on the same day. Patient also had fast heartbeat yesterday. She reports she had a fast heartbeat; it was in the low 90s, she knows that&#39;s not fast for some people, but it was fast for her, and it would come and go like palpitations.

She looked on the internet for lymph nodes in neck, she knew she had lymph nodes in her neck and it was really, really tight. It was both sides of her neck. It&#39;s not as bad today because she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore last night so she could take Tylenol. She was to a point sitting in a chair, how could she stretch her neck because it hurt so bad.

A 77-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 14Feb2021 probably around 1 or 1:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose, dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 21Jan2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

This past Saturday, 15May2021 she was diagnosed positive with COVID-19 by a COVID-19 rapid test. No other tests reported. Patient stated the case she has was not too severe. She got a knee injection on the same day of the vaccine. She was not sure what medication it was but she thought it was cortisone. She stated it appeared her immune system didn&#39;t react properly so it made her feel she was not properly protected by the vaccine. Patient added that she had a couple of injections into her knee and she did not know if that can have any effect on the vaccine and break down immunity. Patient asked if she can get an additional shot since this one obviously did not work. Patient added that she did not want to get COVID19. She wanted to find out why did it breakdown, why did her immunity breakdown. Secondly, once this is all over, can she get another shot? She is not going to get comfortable based on what is going to happen. Diagnosed with COVID19 after receiving vaccines, patient stated that she had a few symptoms and was shocked it came back positive. She had no fever, she had no nausea. She had headaches, chills, and a really bad cough in 2021. Her nose was running continuously in 2021. When she got the headaches, she felt like her head was pounding or coming through her ears in her head. It was like something she never experienced before and it was out of the ordinary. She thought it was something more than an ordinary cold so she went and got tested. Patient was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) and she took some Coricidin for treatment, and stated this was an over the counter decongestant. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. Patient just went to the medical building.    Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 12May2021 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included acne and migraine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 12May2021, patient experienced soreness in arm. On 13May2021, she had symptoms of rash on her face and it&#39;s itching, and the rash started in her face and ear, all on the left side, on her ear half way down the outside of the ear. She could see all the pimples on the face so she put hot water on it and used rubbing alcohol, which she thought would help curb the itching and dry it up, the bottom of the ear lobe is very much active going into jaw area still. She also had headache, and tiredness following her dose, the doctor told her if headache was severe, take a Tylenol with codeine, she took something with codeine and it went away after about three hours. She also had some breast pain (only in the enfold of her breast closest to the middle of her chest), sore to the touch, and it was very sore for about 24 hours, and that it hasn&#39;t fully resolved. Then, while bathing, she noticed a knot in the vaginal area right in the fold of pelvis and thigh inside of the pelvis that was painful, large, and the size of a quarter, if she push on the pelvic bone area, it would be painful. Also, while bathing, she identified cysts in the rectal area; after bathing she was trying to identify what they were, when she touched it, it hurt, it felt like a ball and eventually it went down and she caused them to bleed, not a lot of blood, just a small amount. She also started getting more growths in the vaginal area/bottom area near the rectum. Patient got sleepy and now made herself go lay down and she doesn&#39;t usually do that. She felt a little bad, she didn&#39;t think it was severe side effects, she knew things were going on that she could pinpoint to what would possibly happen but not these cysts. She was recently seen by her gynecologist, a week ago, and none of these problems were apparent at that time. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. Patient had blood work done on 07Apr2021 and 10Apr2021 before the vaccine. The outcome of cysts bleeding and soreness in arm was recovered on 13May2021, itching rash, breast pain, painful knot, cysts in the rectal area was recovering, headache was recovered, other event outcome was unknown.

Two (2) days after the second vaccine on 21Feb2021, neuropathy felt worse; her eyes were extremely sensitive to light. She sat inside with shutters closed. She was very sensitive to light. She went outside to walk, wore sunglasses and large brimmed hat. At times she had to stop. She couldn&#39;t open her eyes. She felt more on her left side. She had to pull the brim down. She was also getting muscle spasms in right arm and under right breast and going across her stomach and in legs at times. It was more in her arm and stomach areas. She was getting in in legs also. Her eyes are still a little sensitive but not bad. Her doctors wanted her to go off her neuropathy medication. They also talked about replacing the Gabapentin with other medications, but it was explained they all have side effects. She had been taking 2 pills and went down to 1 pill. Neuropathy got worse. They did not think the Gabapentin was part of it. Confirmed with caller that neuropathy medication was Gabapentin. They did not think pill had anything to do with it. Caller stated that she had been on it for at least 4 years. She had been afraid to start on something else. She said everything had something. Caller reported that she has been back on 2 pills of Gabapentin for 3 weeks now. On unspecified date, the end of her fingers and toes are still hurting and feel frozen. At her next appointment, she wanted to know if can go on 3 pills and then cut back. She had it for 4 years, but it got worse. This was under control, the neuropathy, and now all of this threw it out of control. Caller stated that everything calmed down about 9 days later. She had problem with her eyes, she did not have to sit inside in the dark. The neuropathy was there but not quite as painful. After going down to 1 pill of Gabapentin, it got worse. In the past she had dry eyes. She went to 3 different doctors and had different eye drops. They mentioned that her blink was not normal. They put plugs in and for about year, her eyes didn&#39;t bother her. At her first appointment, she checked her eyes. She ordered permanent plugs for her eyes for her dry eyes. She had slow abnormal blink on 21Feb2021. Very slow blink. It was causing eyes to be dry. They had suspicion that it was Benign Essential Blepharospasm on unspecified date. She wanted her to stop taking the Gabapentin as side effect is loss of muscle. On unspecified date, her eyes were red and irritated when she was in for her treatment. She was having hard time in there. Her next appointment was 19Mar2021. Caller said her first appointment was 09Mar2021 and she put in plugs. Her vision was blurry. PRIVACY felt she definitely had Benign Essential Blepharospasm. She talked to other doctors and it was agreed this is what she had. The only cure for Benign Essential Blepharospasm is these little Botox injections in her eye. Caller stated on 23Mar2021 she went back. Her eyes were getting worse. She had abnormal blinking problems opening and closing her eyes. She injected Botox on top. Her vision was clear and her blink was back to normal. This only lasted for half an hour. At the visit she saw white circle around the cornea. Caller stated the cure didn&#39;t work. Next visit was 30Mar2021. Her eyes were getting worse and worse, mainly only the whites of her eyes were showing. She was having trouble keeping her eyes open. Caller said that a few years ago she got up 3 times in the middle of the night and it took a minute or two to get her eyes open. Her fear was that she couldn&#39;t get her eyes open. Caller stated that it was exhausting to keep her eyes open. She got medicine drops to keep her eyes open. 06Apr2021 the white circle around her cornea was getting smaller. It was still blurry. It was burning, but it was a pinch better. She had more control over the muscle. The drops were Apraclonidine ophthalmic drops. At this point her eyes were barely open. Mostly saw whites of eyes. Barely color. Caller stated that she started 2 pills of Gabapentin. On 19Apr2021 white around cornea gone. She had blurry days but also clear ones. They ordered MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging). Her blink was still abnormally slow. When she tried to read or watch TV, it strained her eyes. 02May2021 MRI was done. She saw PRIVACY 03May2021 for treatment and he already had MRI results. MRI normal. They talked about Gabapentin and said he did not believe it was that. Caller says she told him that she had gone back on it. She was getting more muscle control. She continued to use ointment that they had given to her. She told her not to drive. She used the ointment twice daily. It was Erythromycin 5mg. She put in in her eyes twice daily. On 07May2021 appointment PRIVACY said vision was 20/30. It was 20/50 when it was bad. The white circle in her eyes was slightly back. Seeing improvement. On 21May2021 was last appointment. PRIVACY checked her vision and it was 20/25. Caller said she was dancing around. She looked so much better. Her blink was more normal. PRIVACY confirmed that all of the problems were from the second dose. Caller stated that her friend knew a scientist that said that if it was from vaccine, it would take at least 3 months to get normal. It is getting more normal, her eyes. She is driving. Once in awhile it gets a little blurry but mostly pretty clear. It is nothing like before. She could only read one line and texting she knew where it was. She mainly sat around with her eyes closed resting them. Her biggest fear was they would close and not open. Treatment for the events slow abnormal blink, Benign Essential Blepharospasm, her eyes were red and irritated, vision was blurry, white circle around the cornea included Eye plugs, Apraclonidine ophthalmic drops, Botox on eyes, Erythromycin Ointment. She had transplant 3 years ago, bone and blood for Multiple Myeloma. Her doctors researched the chemotherapy she had for the transplant to see if it had anything to do with this. Caller than gave more information regarding the transplant. She had pneumonia. She was supposed to have transplant. There was a shadow on her lung. She had CT scan on unspecified date. She had to cancel her transplant. Something was in the lung. They did a biopsy on her lung (unspecified date). During the biopsy, they pulled her arm down hard. That is when the neuropathy started. She had fungus from the pneumonia. It took 3 months to heal the fungus. Cancer was back up higher than the first time. When it was down low enough, she had the transplant. Caller stated that day or two after blood test for Myasthenia Gravis, she had difficulty swallowing. She looked at internet. She thinks it was just nerves and trying to keep her eyes open. It was exhausting. She called a girl to come stay with her and it went away. When she looked at the internet, she got shook up. The events neuropathy felt worse, extremely sensitive to light, slow abnormal blink, benign essential blepharospasm, her eyes were red and irritated, vision was blurry, white circle around the cornea, muscle spasms in right arm and under right breast and going across her stomach and in legs at times resulted in physician office visit. The patient underwent laboratory test which included Blood test for Myasthenia Gravis in 30Mar2021 with negative result, MRI eyes on 02May2021 with normal result. The outcome of the events neuropathy felt worse, slow abnormal blink, Benign Essential Blepharospasm was not recovered; the events left arm hurting, eyes were extremely sensitive to light was recovering; the outcome of white circle around the cornea recovered on 19Apr2021; and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration upper arm probably only about 4inches down from shoulder blade on the left on 12Jan2021 18:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID on 01Oct2020. Concomitant medication included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) as blood thinner. The patient previously took a flu and shingles shot and experienced her redness and swelling on her arm. The patient did not have vaccinations four weeks prior, and no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. She got it because she was told by her doctor that her antibodies will not last forever and it was still necessary to get it even though she already had COVID antibodies. She contracted COVID on 01Oct2020, that was the date when she had a positive test then she was last tested in December and she still had the antibodies then. She received her first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday 12Jan2021 and 24 hours later on 13Jan2021, she experienced chills and feeling very hot, which she took Tylenol extra strength for and it disappeared the next day. Her arm also swelled, not the whole arm, she would say about 3 inches around the site, 4 inches at the most and it was still swollen, it was red and itchy. Then she woke up in a horrible sweat but by the following morning it was gone. She wouldn&#39;t say it was a horrible reaction but she wanted to be certain she can go ahead and get the second shot which she had an appointment for. She said everything has resolved completely except for the swelling, her arm was still swollen, itchy, and red. Since the swelling, redness and itchiness began she would say it was slightly better than it was. The patient received the vaccine at an independent assisted living facility, not a military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events chills, feeling very hot and woke up in a horrible sweat was recovered on 14Jan2021, while the remaining events was recovering.

A 78-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization, ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication and pirfenidone (ESBRIET), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at an unknown dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included pulmonary fibrosis (diagnosed between 2007-2010), Lymphoma type B, blood pressure (abnormal), cholesterol (abnormal), vertigo, biopsy, tightening of legs and feet, drip (nasal) and pain. Concomitant medication included gabapentin for tightening of her legs and feet, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for drip (nasal) and meloxicam for pain. It was reported that the patient took the vaccine and had two sleepless nights on 05Jan2021, her body turned very hot but she have some conditions. Sleepless nights: they have been really rough nights. Scary. Coughing and choking. She thinks the vaccine kicked in and started beating the hell out of it. The patient clarified that she is having sleepless nights because of the coughing, choking, and burning and she feels that it is related to the vaccine kicking in. She slept last night, 14Jan2021. The cough is starting again today (as reported). She hopes it calms down. When she said her body was hot, like burning she was describing her sleepless nights. She is afraid. She is keeping in contact with her doctor. She figured she better call because more people are on this medication. The patient also experienced congestion on 06Jan2021.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), intramuscularly left deltoid on 12Jan2021 10:50 at a single dose for prevention (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included cystitis interstitial and headache. There were no concomitant medications. The patient didn&#39;t receive other vaccines in the last 4 weeks. The patient reported that she had her first dose on 12Jan2021 around 10am and she experienced severe chills where she could not get warm and nausea the night of 13Jan2021, about 10pm. It lasted approximately 8 hours. She probably had a temperature, but she was shaking so much, she did not check. She could not get warm. The next day, she was tired, and probably because she could not sleep the night before. The tiredness was back to normal on 14Jan2021 at 8pm. She was awake the whole night until 8am. The chills stopped and she was very, very tired. Around 8pm on 14Jan2021, she felt like her normal self and it was amazing. She was not feeling well that day (unspecified date). She is due for her second dose on 02Feb2021. She added that she had severe chill (&#34;couldn&#39;t get warm&#34;) and nausea then the next morning, she was tired because she didn&#39;t get good sleep the night before and then felt like herself the following day. The nausea stopped 8 hours afterwards. The tiredness was back to normal on 14Jan2021 at 8pm. She mentioned that she was treated for interstitial cystitis before she took the vaccine. She began to experience a headache prior to receiving the vaccination and called the hotline to see if it was COVID. They did not want to test her since she did not have any other symptoms. She got tested for COVID on 18Jan2021, and it came back negative. She inquired if she can take 25mg of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) prior to her receiving her second dose to prevent side effects. Treatment was received by the patient. The outcome of the event feeling unwell was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 14Jan2021 20:00.

                                                Immediately after receiving the vaccine had heart palpitations while sitting down for the 15 minute wait time.  She thought it would be temporary and go away, but did not.  She came home, and it was still happening, still having them.  She talked to her daughter and went to the ER.  They did an EKG and blood work for fear of having a heart attack, all was negative.  Didn&#39;t do anything more for her.  After 3 hours and moved to a chair and then it suddenly stopped.  She did have this reaction for about 5 hours.   Still feeling tired but not sure if it was from weather or stress itself.

                                                little depressed; not feeling like herself; weak; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 78-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140 and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose on the left arm on 19Dec2020 10:30 (lot number: EL0140). Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had no side effects after the first vaccine except for a little tenderness which went away. On 11Jan2021, after receiving the second dose, she felt really tired but which went away. On 20Jan2021 (last Wednesday), she started to feel tired, weak, and not feeling like herself. On 22Jan2021, the patient was a little depressed. She did not have a headache. Her blood pressure was fine and she never had a fever. She had an X-ray back in Sep2020. Her vision is good. She is not hurting anywhere. She doesn&#39;t feel as strong. She doesn&#39;t understand the tiredness, weakness, and depression. Outcome of the event tired was recovered on 11Jan2021, of the events doesn&#39;t feel like herself and weak was not recovered, and of the event depression was recovering. The reporter assessed all the events as related to the bnt162b2. The events depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself were reported as serious: medically significant while the other events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory role of bnt162b2 in triggering the onset depression and doesn&#39;t feel like herself cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 78-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3248, expiration date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lupus from 26Feb2019 and ongoing, biopsy done/diagnosed 26Feb2019, known to be cutaneous, unknown if systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-not officially diagnosed as SLE yet but keep monitoring to see, patient sister has possibly compromised immune system with lupus; ongoing allergies, included ongoing allergies/reactions to insect stings, wasp stings-that was first reaction 8-9 years ago-carried EpiPen since then, dye in a contrast medium for CT scan in Sep2020; had serious surgery, 2 subsequent surgeries, couldn&#39;t remember anything within last couple of years, 1st surgery: fall or beginning of 2019; scheduled to have surgery to repair abdominal surgery as a result of all the other stuff, had to cancel it and reschedule for spring due to rash, rash diagnosed as lupus; compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic / chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity; overweight. No allergies/reactions to vaccines historically. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydroxychloroquine (Zydus Pharmaceuticals, Lot number: E003901, Expiry date: 31May2022, NDC: Unknown, UPC: 4181077301, repeatedly verified dispensed in standard amber/orange pharmacy bottle; but had manufacturer label on bottle-no NDC) for lupus. The patient previously used epinephrine (EPIPEN, reported as Epi-pen) first/only time 2020: maybe summer/fall/Sep2020 for anaphylactic reaction to yellow jacket sting. On 24Jan2021 around 2:30pm she had onset of extreme fatigue (just like kind of an overwhelming fatigue). She had not even discussed having the vaccine with her PCP and did not consider extreme fatigue to be serious or something she needed to contact the doctor about. She ended up getting home, eating something, going upstairs and going to sleep (went &#34;straight to bed&#34;). She slept really well. Outcome improved, she was better, ok. She wondered if this was an extreme reaction to the vaccine or was this normal because this was the first shot, she read that the second dose creates even more pronounced side effects. She was asking if that was a normal reaction and can she expect that after the second dose? No vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The adverse event did not result in Emergency Room or Physician Office, and patient was not hospitalized. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the event was recovering.

I literally slept all of the next day only getting up occasionally and most of the day after that.  I started to become more normal feeling the late afternoon of 1/28/21. I also felt very stiff and uncomfortable.  Sore neck and joint pain and a slight headache.  I had a sore area across my arm (felt like a bruise although there was no discoloration) about 1 inch inch below the injection sight which was on my upper left arm.  That persisted for several days. I slept and took 1 800 mg Ibuprofen (on   1/27/2021). Am feeling better but still not feeling 100 %.  That may be due to increased allergies due to time of year of etc a

                                                My Mom had an an allergic reaction four hours after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her face swelled up and became red....worse on the right side than the left...her eyes were swollen as well. It lasted this way for four days....it is a little better now, but her face is still a little swollen (seven days after shot). She had a headache on and off and felt tired (which we understand is not an allergic reaction, but rather an immune response). Her family physician suggested taking antihistamines before her second shot. Needless to say, we are apprehensive about what the outcome from the second shot will be like for her.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 25Jan2021 at 13:00 (at 78 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included anxiety, headache, dry eye and low potassium, each from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included potassium oral at 10 meq daily for low potassium, cholecalciferol (D3) oral at 2000 iU once a day to help with bones, fish oil oral at 1200 mg once a day, alprazolam at 0.5 mg as needed (take one three times a day) for anxiety, clonazepam oral at 0.5 mg once a day for anxiety, nortriptyline HCl oral at 10 mg once a day, paracetamol (TYLENOL) at 500 mg as needed for headache, estradiol (SYSTEN) ophthalmic one drop as needed, all from an unknown date and ongoing.  The patient experienced one or two hours after the vaccine (on 25Jan2021), she went to talk, she couldn&#39;t get her sentence straight. She knew what she wanted to say but she couldn&#39;t say it. Her first thought was that she was having a stroke and it really scared her. She became very tired and went to sleep, when she woke up, she was talking straight but she was still really tired. The next morning (on 26Jan2021) she had diarrhea three time and after that she felt better. The patient outcome of speech disorder and diarrhea was recovered on 26Jan2021 and the outcome of tiredness was recovering.  The information on the batch number has been requested.

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

A 78-years-old female patient receive first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID Prevention. Medical history included ongoing High Blood Pressure, she was diagnosed approximately 5 years prior to starting blood pressure medications in 1998. Concomitant medication included hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN AND HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) at 320mg/12.5mg, once daily, by mouth from 1998 and ongoing, amlodipine besylate at 5mg, once daily, by mouth at night from 1998, both for High blood pressure. The patient stated that she did not realize, but she must have been exposed to the COVID Virus, prior to getting her shot. She stated that on 15Jan2021, she went and got her Pfizer COVID shot, and that same day, by the time she got home, she was starting to feel bad and it went downhill from there. She mentioned that on the same day on 15Jan2021, she &#34;came down with covid&#34;. She finally went in on 22Jan2021, and got tested, and she did test positive for COVID. The patient was tested Positive for COVID-19 on 22Jan2021. She did believe she was getting better. On 29Jan2021, she felt fairly decent, and today, she is kind of weak but she is assuming that will happen. She was scheduled to go back for her second dose on 08Feb2021, and she is wondering if there are recommendations about the second dose, for people who tested positive for COVID after having gotten the first dose. When queried for her PCP contact information, she stated that her head is not working really great and she feels stupid she did not have this information handy to provide. She states that the first week with her symptoms, she just figured she did have the virus. She had a cough but it never got down to where she had trouble breathing, and she just figured that her body had to go through, whatever it was going to go through, and as long as the patient felt like she was okay, there was not anything anyone could do, she just had to play it out. When she did finally go get tested, the doctor told her to get on Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what the patient has been taking, and she feels like it has helped a lot. Before she saw the doctor, she was taking Acetaminophen, but the doctor told her to do the Nyquil and Ibuprofen, so that is what she has been doing. By the time she got home from getting her vaccine, her heart was racing. She took her blood pressure and it was okay at 125/73, and her heart rate was 72. She has high blood pressure and she takes two medications for that, so she took her night time blood pressure pill and the fast beating of her heart went away. The next day, she got to aching. She has had all different aches, and she ran a fever that got up to 101, and the rest of the time it was 100 or 99, but the fevers were not all day long, they would just come and go. Now she has had no fever in four or more days, and she is doing better. She does still have the cough, but she also has allergies so she does not know what is causing the cough. As far as the reaction to the vaccine, just her arm got sore. But she thinks she was exposed prior to getting the vaccine and just did not know it. she stated that the people took her temperature the day of the shot and she didn&#39;t have a temperature. She did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of fever was recovering, of cough and allergies was not recovered, of her heart was racing was recovered.

Just noticed that my vaccine card shows Lot #EN6202 but the letter sent says Lot #EL9263, for the 2nd dose.

                                                LTC Pharmacy was notified of a potential vaccine related hospital admission on 3/8/2021. The following information was gathered from discussion with RPH at Hospital. The patient received second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/26/2021. The patient then had nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. On 2/27/2021, the patient went to the bathroom and while on the toilet, had a vasovagal event which led to her hitting the side of the face while falling. Patient was then taken to the hospital for evaluation. The patient does have a pacemaker but the cause of the event was determined to likely be due to dehydration. Lab work was performed and pertinent lab values include: potassium of 3.1, SCr of 0.8, and BUN of 13. The patient received potassium supplementation and IV hydration in the hospital. Patient was discharged on 2/28/2021. Of note, the patient does have a pacemaker and a follow-up appointment with cardiology to evaluate the pacemaker was scheduled upon discharge.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

                                                I had the second Covid (Pfizer) vaccine on February 22. The next day I had chills, fever, aches, nausea and was very weak. After about 30 hours I felt okay again.  However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.  Since the rash was almost certainly covid vaccine related, I am making this report, which my doctor recommended. I had no other changes in diet, medications, environment, etc. ? only the Pfizer vaccine was new to my body.

The patient had regular flu shot a few years ago it was mentioned that doctor told get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and she was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine. Concomitant medications included rizatriptan benzoate (MAXALT) at 10 mg, as needed for migraine. Consumer stated, &#34;I had Tubular Dysfunction been diagnosed many years ago and I live with dizzy every day In Mar2021. I have tried everything to get rid of it and nothing is working. This is going on for Probably 40 years may be more anyway (Intent: History). I had my second vaccine on 10Mar2021 and on the first day, my doctor told me since I had the reaction to the regular Flu shot a few years ago my doctor told me get a Benadryl an hour before my shot which I did and the first day everything was wonderful. I was so happy you know no reaction, I didn&#39;t have any. The first time I got the flu shot I was in the hospital for 5 hours on a Breathing machine, it was beautiful. I thought I was free and then the next day my arm got real sore and I expected that and I expected to have a fever I expected to feel nauseous and all but the dizziness set in and just got progressively worse and it will be a week tomorrow since the vaccine still I was dizzy In Mar2021. I have been so off-center In Mar2021. Sunday I could hardly do over I was just so sick with the dizziness and yesterday the same thing and this morning I thought I will get over maybe today will be a good day and it&#39;s the same. I called my neurologist and he said that any pre-existing condition can be exaggerated by the vaccine while the system is building up his anti-bodies so I expected but is this going to go away, this thing, is this going to go away and reported just so beside myself, I just can&#39;t live like this anymore everyday you know this is beyond dizzy.&#34; tried taking, I do have a prescription for it starts with M wait a minute it hasn&#39;t helped but I tried it , if it doesn&#39;t help for the first time I won&#39;t take it again but I have a prescription for Meclizine 25 mg Tablets. Consumer stated, &#34;I spoke to somebody earlier and told me to call this number and tell you that what&#39;s going with me. Tomorrow will be one week, since I had my second Covid shot and the first day, I got it everything was fine. The second day I was feeling a little off and I thought okay will they told me that I would feel little, may be not sick-sick but not feeling good and then the second day after that Friday. I got it on Wednesday and by Friday, I have a pre-existing condition and it is called Vestibular Dysfunction. Consumer stated, &#34;I had the Vestibular Dysfunction from 40 years. So, I live with dizzy all the time. But by Friday, it is just unbelievable dizzy, Saturday was worse, Sunday was even worse, yesterday was little bit better. Today, I am still shaking and dizzy and Tomorrow will be one week since I have the shot and I read that stuff happened in the first week and I was wondering, have you had the other people with the same problem, Consumer further added, &#34;It is not an inconvenience, this is horrible way to live. I feel dizzy all the time, this is horrible. Was I told that I should talk to you about, can the shot exacerbate a bad situation like this, they told me to call you, now I getting no help at all can anybody tell me.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;Nothing I have no recollection of any of that no, I just started coughing and they told me to go to the emergency room so I did you know In Mar2021. The patient has received treatment with Meclizine 25 mg tablets. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

There was so many people so she just kept walking and luckily was able to get to car and told her husband she did not feel good. By then she had a terrible headache and when she got home she laid down right away. Then things started spinning and she was very nauseous and is aware that these things can happen with the vaccine. Had flu like symptoms like she never had before, but this was worse. She did not have a fever, but was flushed and very cold, chills. Her arm was not hurting until about 9pm and during the night she had a rapid heart beat, but not really. Was very anxious like something was going to happen and she tried to calm herself by taking deep breaths but does not know if that worked. Finally, after 3 hours she was able to go to sleep and did go to the bathroom a couple times and felt week with the flu like symptoms, they were very bad. When she got up today she was 60-65% better. She did eat something later yesterday and had thought the nausea was because she hadn&#39;t eaten all day long. The food was flat tasting and she know she has that whenever she has the flu where nothing tastes right. She clarifies she has that anyway since 16 years ago she had cancer and a strong dose of chemotherapy and radiation and her immune system since has not been the same and has been very deprived. Whenever she gets sick she gets deathly sick and has to be watched or she may have to get hospitalized due to weakened immune system. States some people say that the second dose is worse, is that true or is it the same feeling. If she feels like that with the second dose she may not get it. No further details provided. Mentions as the day goes on she comes around more. Has to get her glasses to see card given. No other vaccines given that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. The outcome of event her immune system since has not been the same and has been very deprived was unknown and other events were not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

                                                caller doesn&#39;t feel great; Headache; was exhausted/she was so worn out, she just felt zapped; had chills; fever of 100; overall a feeling like she had the flu; had no appetite; felt sluggish; she slept most of the day; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 78-year-old female (pregnancy unknown) patient receive second dose in series of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN5318), via unknown route of administration on Right arm on 03Feb2021 09:00 (the day of vaccination), at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history includes High blood pressure, and historical vaccine Caller had the First Dose on 13Jan2021 and it was Lot number EL3302. Caller had the Second Dose on 03Feb2021, and it was Lot number: EN5318. Caller reports that she got both doses via injection into the right arm. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that caller states that she would like to talk about side effects from the COVID vaccine. Caller had the first dose of the product on 13Jan2021 and the second dose, this past Wednesday at 09 AM. Caller states that she was fine the whole rest of that day but then she woke up at 3 AM the next day and everything had changed. Caller states that she had a headache, she was exhausted, had chills, a fever of 100, it was overall a feeling like she had the flu. Caller is wondering if these are known side effects of the product because the caller&#39;s husband also got the vaccine, and he did not have any of these symptoms. Caller states that her primary care doctor is her Gynecologist and he is not aware that the caller even had the vaccine because she only goes to him once a year. Caller confirms the product was not prescribed to her by anyone in particular. Caller states that she had just read about the product and saw stuff on TV and thought that because of her age she should get it. Caller states that her brother in law is a physician and he told the caller to get the product. Caller states that her brother in law got the shot too and after his first shot he was fine but he had a few symptoms after the second shot, where he was feeling like he had the flu but he did not have as many symptoms as the caller had. Caller states that she got through the whole day of the day she had the injection and everything was great until 3 AM the next morning and she woke up with all the side effects. Caller states that she was so worn out, she just felt zapped, she had no appetite, a dull headache, she slept most of the day, fever of 100, and overall she felt sluggish. Now today, caller doesn&#39;t feel great, but she has no symptoms, she is just washed out. Caller states that she just guesses she did not know to expect that from the product. Caller states that she had heard there were some side effects and some people get them more than others but her husband did not get a single one. Caller is also wondering if the side effects will just go away on their own. Caller had no other vaccines on the same days as her doses of the COVID vaccines. Caller states that she has not had any bloodwork done in a while.

                                                Two weeks and six days after the first shot, my left arm became swollen, as if it was lymphedema, something I don&#39;t get, or perhaps gout.  After the second shot, the arm swelled more, with the hand looking like a balloon and a few days of tiredness.  I put on a few pounds.  Dr wanted to rule out a recurrence of breast cancer so she sent me for ultrasound, mammograms, and CT scans, with a week gap to take antibiotics for a UTI.  At a coincidental checkup with my glaucoma doctor, he said the intraocular pressure had shot up and added 0.5% Timolol eyedrops, a beta blocker.  In a few days, the swelling is less and the extra weight gone.

A 78-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Solution for injection; Lot number: EM9809) via unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were not provided. It was reported that caller and his wife received the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, he experienced a little of body aches that disappeared; however, his wife experienced a severe reaction: ongoing chills from 10feb2021, ongoing sweating from 10feb2021, ongoing headache from 10feb2021, from 10feb2021 to 11feb2021 experienced fever, ongoing body aches from 10feb2021 and today she broke out in rash on the front of her body from 11Feb2021 and ongoing no appetite from 10feb2021. They would like to know if there are any recommendations on what to do. Calling about the Covid 19 Vaccine. States that he and his wife had their 2nd doses of the vaccine on Tuesday afternoon. He had very little side effects; just body aches. But his wife woke up the first night after getting the shot with chills, fever, sweats, headache, and body aches. Today she is feeling a little better; her temperature this morning was 99.2, and she had a really bad headache. When she got in the shower, she noticed that she had a rash on her body; it doesn&#39;t itch. States that she has a little appetite today, which is good because she didn&#39;t eat at all yesterday. Asks, what does he need to do, if anything at all?

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 78-years-old, administered in arm on 25Feb2021 15:45 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus from 2011 (Verbatim: Diabetic; Diagnosed 10 years ago), rheumatoid arthritis from 1995 (Verbatim: Rheumatoid arthritis; Diagnosed in 1995), cardiac failure congestive from Oct2020 (Verbatim: Congestive Heart Failure), adrenal insufficiency from 1990 (Verbatim: Adrenal insufficiency; Diagnosed in probably 1990), atrial fibrillation from 2017 (Verbatim: Atrial fibrillation; Diagnosed 4 years ago). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (&#34;she takes lots of medications. Too long of list she probably takes 15 different medications, reporter chose not to provide them). No-other vaccines were given at the same time. She gets the flu vaccine every year, shingles vaccines, pneumonia vaccines every year but, has no idea where they were manufactured. Confirmed she did not get the listed vaccines at the same time she got the COVID Vaccine. The patient&#39;s husband and the patient (his wife) both received their 1st COVID shot on the 25Feb2021 and was scheduled for 3 weeks later. He got his COVID on the 18Mar2021. The patient got Pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital but he does not know the exact time the Pneumonia started. It developed over a period of several day started with a mild fever (in Mar2021) and after the 2nd or 3rd day her fever spiked and that&#39;s when she was admitted to the hospital. He reports his wife went into the hospital with Pneumonia on 18Mar2021, the day she was supposed to get the 2nd shot. It was also reported that Pneumonia was related to MRSA. She laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks, the weakness (&#34;very weak&#34;) may have happened in the hospital or a few days before, date was confirmed to be on 15Mar2021. The event &#34;pneumonia&#34; was totally unrelated to COVID and now she is in a nursing home, she went in on 26Mar2021. She probably won&#39;t be able to have the 2nd shot for a couple of weeks. She was in there for a couple of weeks and still quarantined. He wanted to know will the fact that she is not getting the 2nd shot at the 3-week interval reduce the efficacy of the vaccine since she is getting the 2nd dose late. Does it make a difference with the effectiveness of the vaccine if she&#39;s going take the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks or even a month and a half rather than the usual 21 days interval? No treatment before going to the hospital other than calling the doctor and the doctor saying take her to the hospital (not reported if patient received treatment during hospital stay). No treatment done over the weekend, while she was in the nursing home. The adverse event pneumonia required a visit to Emergency Room. The patient was hospitalized from 18Mar2021 to 26Mar2021. Investigations included had a lot of blood work done, a CT scan, an X-ray on unspecified dates. He does not have any of the results but, the physicians have them. The outcome of the event mild fever was unknown, for very weak was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovered on 26Mar2021.

I was transported by EMTs to the ER and was later diagnosed with inflamitory bowel by a CT scan.  I took antibiotics and was feeling fine.  My gastroenterologist performed a colonoscopy on 3/24/21 and the findings were that I was healed and tissue samples were normal.  3/25/21 I had an annual physical and was told I was in good health.  Later that afternoon I began feeling light headed upon standing.  In the night I called my health insurance hotline because my blood oxygen meter was beeping  continuously.  The Dr. on call told me to go by ambulance to the ER.  When sitting or lying down, I felt fine and all the tests at the ER for my heart and my vital signs were good.  A few hours later, they did a hest Xray and then a CT scan of my lungs which showed a saddle embulism.  I had also  thought I had bruised my knee if and when I fainted on 2/18 and  1o hours later a blood lot was found by ultrasound of my left knee.  I was given blood thinners in the ER and then in ICU where I spent the next night.  I am now taking Eleris.  I was also given pantoprozole for GERD coughing the next day.  I continue to have periods of abdominal ramping/pain, light headedness in waves and pressure in my head.  I have disontinued the stomach medication with some feeling better with the lightheadedness.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER- BIONTECH COVID- 19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL1283) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypo thyroiditis (does not have it anymore, it was 30 years ago when she was a teacher), knee that was broken twice and allergic to antibiotics from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, really bad pain in her right knee, muscles really tight, didn&#39;t feel so good, she was scared to death, her nerves, anxiety and very frightened. The reporter stated that feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down, was happened after she got her first covid shot. The patient asked to know if it was safe for her to get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient wondered if anyone else, she had the first Pfizer vaccine, later clarified as the COVID vaccine, a week ago last day before the time of this report, and she used to have a really fast heartbeat, but it slowed down, and once in a while, it was fast and stuff, now she had this happened twice, where she felt something click in her body, her heart beats really fast, and she drank water immediately, it slows down, has anyone said this after getting the vaccine. She has been on the phone for two hours. She never had a little click, she had thyroid hypo thyroiditis and every evening she would have a fast heartbeat, her blood pressure would go, but she never had when she would feel this little click, like a little, and her heart was really fast in morning of the report, it was really fast, and the minute she drinks water, it slows it down, it does not make sense. Also, her muscles are really tight, she was 78 and having a hard time with this pandemic, her nerves not good, she was nervous about the vaccine. She stated she was a teacher, and her weight was 106-107 pounds. About the event feeling a click right before her fast heartbeat then drink water and slows it down/something clicks in body, heart beats really fast, the patient stated, unknown when this started, exact date unknown, this has happened twice, this morning was the second one, and the minute she drank water, it slows it down, but it was very very fast, and she did not feel so good after, she was scared to death, her nerves are shot, she has trouble with anxiety, she was feeling ok now. She was nervous about what was going on and would feel better if someone else said they experienced the same. About the event muscles being really tight, the patient stated she has knots, her muscles are tight in her shoulders and neck lots, last night she was writing recipes, she does recipes boxes for her grandkids, and she was using her right arm a lot, she does not get to go to spa since the pandemic, she has not gotten to go to her for over a year. Her husband rubbed it out, and she did heat. Her muscles were tight right after she did it, so it could be something, it said if you think you had a symptom and also the second night after, she had a really bad pain in her right knee, it lasted one night, it was a knee that was broken twice, which may be why it was that leg. She was very very frightened to take it, she reacts to things strangely, when she has any procedure, they always say they never had that happen to anyone, she was allergic to antibiotics, different things happen when she takes different things, she was nervous about the whole thing, which may have to do with it. The second dose is on 12Feb2021. The outcome of the event muscles really tight was recovering and unknown for other events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

She said that she gets up and eats then goes back to sleep or does whatever else she had to do. she can&#39;t lay in bed anyway so she sleeps on the sofa. she did get up the next day and all the time had a headache. She says she doesn&#39;t take the flu shot because her older brother had a terrible reaction to that, none of her siblings take that shot, but she knows what it feels like to have a bad cold with your head heavy, that kind of feeling, she imagines that is what the flu feels like. The patient received treatment with Tylenol for headache. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure (blood pressure measurement): 110/70 mmHg on an unspecified date, blood test: unknown on an unspecified date, Pulse (heart rate): pulse was ok on an unspecified date. Caller said that she was so surprised when she went to her doctor&#39;s appointment that her heart was racing, and she thought her blood pressure would be sky high, but the bottom number was 70 something, which is low for her, and the top number was 110, so it was perfect, which she doesn&#39;t usually have. She said that her pulse was ok and everything else was ok, and she had blood work taken that day but they didn&#39;t get those results back yet, so she doesn&#39;t know what they are. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (13May2021): Follow-up attempts completed. No further information expected.

                                                Tooth reinfected between the two doses; Fever and chills; Fever and chills; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (Patient).  A 79-year-old female patient of an unspecified age received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number: ER2613), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (at the age of 78-year-old), as single for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from 1979 to an unknown date, osteoporosis, back surgery, car accident prior to the pandemic, broken wrist and nerve damage, head and neck cancer, stroke, Brain tumor (inactive), vestibular issues, corneal transplants (two), tooth infection/ like slow infection from 2018 to an unknown date; she was visually disabled; her root canal that got infected and her thyroid was removed surgically, both from 2018 to an unknown date. The previously took bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in Arm left on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 78-year-old), as single for Covid-19 immunization and Shingrex vaccine with horrible reaction. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE) taken for thyroid hormone replacement therapy and zoledronic acid (RECLAST) infusion one time in a year, taken for osteoporosis. On an unspecified date, after the second dose the patient experienced tooth reinfected between the two doses, fever, and chills. She stated that she went to a site where vaccines were being administered by nurses and mentioned that she was diagnosed with cancer there in 1979. When she got the first dose of the vaccine, she had to fill out a health history form, had to talk to a nurse about it, then she got a shot while at the second time around it was different because the nurses leaned in the back window to talk to her and gave her the shot, and she did not have to fill out a form during second shot. The nurses told her that her vaccine would only be 40% effective because of her cancer history as her PSH scores showed that she had a weakened immune system. she was a thyroid cancer patient survivor as her thyroid was removed surgically and was on hormone replacements for that, prior to the vaccines. They also tested her TSH scores. She has not had chemo but a month before the pandemic the doctor started doing labs to track her PSH levels and was going to change her thyroid hormone doses. She took a thyroid hormone replacement, levothyroxine. She stated sometimes if the dose was wrong, got heart palpitations. She stated she used to be on 112 mcg and now was on 75 mcg. She was hoping that doctor knew about endocrinology and had figured out why her hormone replacement was not as effective as it should be. They checked her labs but had not called and said that she had a better immune system. They kept pushing her procedures further and further without diagnosing her. They tested her for covid antibodies, but she tested negative. She had stoke, brain tumour that was inactive, vestibular issues, two corneal transplants, and she was blind. Additionally, she had a horrible reaction to the Shingrex vaccine in the past and mentioned that she got vaccines for everything as she was trying to live to be 90 years old. she was also on Reclast infusion one time a year for osteoporosis and wanted to know if that could affect the vaccine, she was recovering from back surgery, was in a car accident prior to the pandemic, she typically would get shots in her weaker arm as she had a broken wrist and nerve damage, prior to the vaccines; she was visually disabled, since before vaccines; she was a head and neck cancer, and stroke, prior to vaccines. She had a root canal that got infected in 2018 and it was like a slow infection, started prior to the vaccine which was reinfected between the two doses, had fever and chills. She thought it was a reaction to the second dose then realized it was the infection in her mouth. Hence, she saw her dentist. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                She got her vaccine, had no reaction.  The next morning/afternoon she had a headache/head pressure, light headedness.  As the days went on she had impaired equilibrium issues, which she is still having therapy for.   She called her doctor after about 4 weeks of experiencing these symptoms every day, and he suspected that since she was dizzy and had equilibrium issues that it could be an inner ear problem, and referred her to an ENT.  She went to the ER with pressure in her chest and headache.  She had an EKG, stress test, doppler on the carotid arteries, and chest x-ray.  All of these tests were negative for any findings.  She then saw the ENT and he ruled out Meniere&#39;s disease, any inner ear problem, ordered a brain MRI.  This showed mild constriction of the small blood vessels consistent with her age and that was all.  She continued to have the problems, and her PCP recommended balance therapy and sent her to therapy for that.  This therapy is helping her, and she continues to still go for the therapy.  Any of the doctors that she saw felt that it was an over-reaction of her immune system to the vaccine.

A 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in arm left on 21Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6200) (at the age of 78-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HDL) and hypothyroidism, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously took SSRI, PNC (unknown), sulfa and oxycodone; the patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in arm left on 31Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9265) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Within 12 hours of vaccine (on 22Feb2021) the patient developed symptoms of fatigue, malaise, headache (HA) and severe and near syncope.  She visited the emergency department (ED) the following day.  Work up at that time including blood work and no imaging.  She was treated with IVFs and discharged.  Symptoms of malaise, fatigue and HA persisted for &gt; 1 week.  A computerized tomogram (CT) of the head was performed on 05Mar2021, this CT showed the following: acute subarachnoid hemorrhage involving both hemispheres; acute on chronic right subdural hematoma up to 7 mm thick; 2X3 left front hemorrhagic contusion with edema. The events required emergency room visit and physician office visit.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and includes conservative measures (as reported). The patient outcome of the event was recovered with sequel.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 78-years-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included macular degeneration. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included tetanus vaccine on an unspecified date for immunisation. She got her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine on 25Feb2021 and thought she was having a reaction. She called her doctor and he said go get some Benadryl to make sure your throat doesn&#39;t get swollen. She went out and bought Benadryl and she took the Benadryl every six hours. Her doctor said don&#39;t get the second dose of the Covid 19 vaccine because these side effects she had are a warning and the second dose might not be helpful for her. The patient reported that she stayed at the facility that gave her the Covid 19 vaccine for 20 minutes and her husband was waiting for her. When she was driving away from the facility her tongue felt burned and then her mouth was burning and then her throat was burning on an unspecified date. She does have acid reflux but this wasn&#39;t like any acid reflux she&#39;s ever had. She got home and she drank some cool water but everything was still burning. By then it was almost supper time so she took 20 mg of Pepcid. Her mouth burned throughout her meal. She called her doctor again and he asked her if her mouth was swollen and she told him she didn&#39;t know. She took more Benadryl. One of her daughter&#39;s told her that the Covid 19 virus was so bad that she should get her second dose of the Covid 19 vaccine no matter how bad her reaction was. Her doctor told her not to get the second Covid 19 vaccine. She assumed it was a done deal. She wasn&#39;t going to get the second dose. She was supposed to get her second dose on 17Mar2021. She had gone to the doctor a couple times and each time he told her, do not get the second Covid 19 vaccine. He showed her the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine print out with side effects. When her mouth started burning after she got the first Covid 19 vaccine her husband did ask her if she wanted to turn around and go back to the facility where she got the vaccine but she told him no. Now she&#39;s missed her second Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021 because she thought that what her doctor told her was the final word. She was afraid to get the second Covid 19 vaccine and she wants to listen to her doctor because he knows what&#39;s best. During this Covid 19 virus time she was also diagnosed with Macular Degeneration. That&#39;s keeping her from driving and she&#39;s lost even more of her independence. She&#39;s heard if she gets the Covid 19 virus it can attack her eyes. Every time she hears the words fully vaccinated it makes her want to cry. She&#39;s worried that people won&#39;t want to be near her because she&#39;s not fully vaccinated. Her husband had both of his Covid 19 vaccines and he had no side effects. Her husband gets every vaccine on the market and never has any side effects. As far as she&#39;s concerned she feels like a pariah because no one will want to be around her because she&#39;s not fully vaccinated. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (02Jun2021): No follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 11Jan2021 10:50 (Batch/Lot Number: EJ1686; Expiration Date: 20Mar2021) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE, vaccinated at the age of 78 years old for covid-19 immunisation. Patient received the first dose on 21Dec2020. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism Diagnosed 20 years ago, ongoing colitis, ongoing proctitis, ongoing diverticulum, ongoing gastrointestinal pain, and breast cancer. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for hypothyroidism, start and stop date were not reported. Caller states she was told by a couple of doctors that she needed to report this. Caller states her first vaccine was 21Dec2021 and then her second dose was on 11Jan2021. Caller states four days after the second dose, she wound up in the ER with severe headache, abdominal pain, dry heaves and she had a morbid feeling. Caller states after that, she saw her doctor and for two months she had problems with nausea, severe nausea, where she couldn&#39;t eat, lost 13 pounds, hypothyroid went to hyperthyroid, very serious extreme anxiety, which she is still battling. Caller states the Endocrinologist felt it could&#39;ve been associated with the vaccine. Caller states the ER ran tests and abdominal scans and all they showed were the usual things she knew she had, nothing new. Caller states she asked the ER doctors, and they said they didn&#39;t know if it was related and when she asked Endocrinology, they said they don&#39;t know for sure. Caller states her Primary doctor said it could be related, anytime a person has a vaccination, if they are immunocompromised or have inflammation, it can possibly trigger this and events occur. Caller states she had dry heaves, an aversion to food, lost weight, and had terrible anxiety, all four days after vaccine. Caller states after the first vaccine, she was fine. Caller states after the second vaccine, she woke up that morning four days after, it was acute, this had never happened before and she had a feeling of doom and dry heaving. Caller states it took her two months, before she started to eat and put the weight back on. Caller states the nausea is gone and she is able to eat and put weight back on. Caller states she still has extreme anxiety and she is seeing a doctor for that and is being medicated so it is persisting by improved with medicaiton. Caller repeats, this all happened four days after her second injection. Caller states no one knows that much about the vaccine but they said something that this reaction should be reported. Caller states the nausea and other GI issues lasted for about two months, but she can&#39;t give actual dates of when it recovered. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know dates of when the other side effects recovered, but they only thing she still has is the anxiety. Seriousness: Caller states the Nausea was disabling, she couldn&#39;t eat at all, she had to drink ensure and boost. Caller states the rest were medically significant. She was worked on by her PCP and Endocrinologist, and they adjusted her thyroid medication to bring back down her levels, and she is sure that is part of the reason for her anxiety and anorexia. Caller states before she had hypothyroid. Treatment: Suppositories, Zofran, Reglan, Anxiety Medication, Adjustment of the thyroid medication Synthroid. States when she lost an extreme amount of weight, her thyroxin increased, so they dropped her dose to the normal range. Causality: Caller states she feels it is related because it was an acute onset and rare for her, even though she is older, she is healthy. Caller states she has had breast cancer but nothing that stopped her from working. Caller states it is hard to know, but she thinks it is related. Caller states her one son was home and called and said mom looks like she is going to pass out and she is not an alarmist and usually would say no, but she said yes, he better make sure that she gets to the ER, she felt impending doom, with abrupt onset. Tests: Caller states they did an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy because of her abdominal pain and they found colitis and proctitis and every, itis, a person can think of along with diverticulosis and inflamed gut, but she already had those, they were not caused by the vaccine, she had them in the past. Outcome of anxiety was recovering, of others was recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship between events anxiety, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, retching, malaise, weight decreased, hyperthyroidism, decreased appetite, eating disorder and company suspect BNT162B2, the causal relationship cannot be denied.

                                                Feeling unwell; fast heart beat; nauseous; unbalanced when walking; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 78-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN9810 and Expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 04Feb2021 14:35 as 1st dose single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included anxiety from Unspecified to Unspecified date. The patient concomitant medication included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for anxiety from Unspecified to Unspecified date. The patient received no other vaccines in the past 4 weeks period. On 05Feb2021, morning, she noticed she is feeling unwell and had a fast heart beat. After eating it got a little better. It says on the paperwork normal side effects to expect like feeling unwell and fast heartbeat which has calm down for her, but she was wondering how long this was expected to last and have the side effect. She was not feeling good this morning. She doesn&#39;t want this to last a long time. The patient reported that after the vaccine she felt nothing, no pain, no pain even at the arm. The patient reported that, she was not completely sure how she was feeling because she was sitting now, she felt nauseous and unbalanced, she was feeling unwell. As she was sitting down, she thinks it was better, but she still feels unbalanced when walking. The patient took half a Xanax when her heartbeat was fast, that was usually the trick that slows it. It was reported that, she takes Xanax for anxiety and maybe that was it was. She took the Xanax because she had to wait on the phone for so long to speak to someone. The second dose was schedule date on 02Mar2021. The patient had so many medications, but had not taken them before this started, she took them later. The patient received list of what she could expect, on the list what she had was a common reaction, but the Fast heart rate was in the call section, but it was not that bad for her to call 911 as she knows a fast heartbeat can happen with her anxiety. She usually gets the flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, she does not remember when she had it last, she usually gets them when it comes out or when pharmacy announces it and asks her. The patient noticed that people who usually get the COVID virus die of Pneumonia, so she thought she would get the pneumonia vaccine. The patient had some exam 2 weeks ago, and yesterday the Physician left a message about the results and did state on the phone that she has nothing to worry about. The outcome of Feeling unwell was not resolved and fast heart beat was resolving.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 79-year-old elderly female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On unspecified date the patient experienced, the patient could not catch her breath, her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220 reported dyspnoea and hospitalization on an unspecified date, had high blood pressure, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing, coughing, soreness in her arm, slept all day long. Additional Context: Consumer states that her doctor wanted her to call and report this, because she has asthma and allergies that are chronic. Consumer states that she took her first Pfizer injection in April. She saw her allergy specialist on the 1st, and she tested the Consumer before she took the vaccine. She states that her breathing was at 113% breathing capacity (good) and the allergy specialist wanted her to go ahead and get the injection, which the Consumer did. Consumer clarifies that she received the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 11Apr2021 and that she did really good with that one. Consumer then received the second COVID vaccine on 13May2021. She came home and slept almost all night long and thought she was okay. The Consumer explains she was not feeling real good before she went to receive her second dose. It was kind of like she was having some coughing and stuff, but she thought it was not bad and that she could still go ahead and get it. She went ahead on 13May2021 and had the second dose. Consumer states that on the first day, she slept all day long- the whole entire day, she didn&#39;t even wake up. On the second day, the Consumer states that she had soreness in her arm. Then, she noticed she was getting really sick and started running a 99.9 temperature. It was getting worse day by day, and she kept coughing and getting worse. Then, on 18May2021, her husband took her to the emergency room and they just automatically treated her for asthma and allergy and sent her home. This was on Tuesday night. On Thursday night, she got so bad that her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her husband rushed her back to the ER and this time, they kept the Consumer and hospitalized her for a week. Her blood pressure was high. She clarifies normally her breathing on her peak flow meter, she can always do from 350-400. Well on Thursday night, her peak flow was all the way down to 220 and she could not catch her breath. Consumer states that she was admitted to the hospital and they had her on oxygen and blood pressure medication. She states that they did a bronch on her and still did not really come to a conclusion of what was happening. She was told it looked like it could be an infection in her lungs. Consumer states that she is having to see three doctors this week because of this since she got out of the hospital. She saw her medical doctor, Dr., yesterday who was very concerned because she had a recent patient that was about the same age as the Consumer- he was 75 years old. This patient had done the same thing, only he ended up taking pneumonia and dying with it. The doctor told the Consumer in her x-ray, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing. The Consumer asked her doctor while she was in the hospital about the pneumonia and they refused to listen to anything the Consumer said, so Dr. told her that the Consumer needed to report this because she is still so sick. Consumer clarifies that she was hospitalized for a week and that she just got out on Saturday, 29May2021. While reporting the event details, the Consumer stated that she had and emergency call coming through and that she had to take it. Consumer had to end the call, stating she had to go and requested this call handler call her back. The patient was hospitalized due to events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 99.9, peak expiratory flow rate: 220 Units: x-ray: had pneumonia showing. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (also reported as Pfizer Covid vaccine, lot number: EK4176), intramuscular into left arm on 05Jan2021 16:00 at single dose indicated as presentation because she is a nurse/Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Type 2 Diabetes, about 2 years ago in 2019 in which she takes metformin 1,000mg twice daily. Concomitant medication included metformin on unspecified date at 1,000mg twice daily for Type 2 Diabetes. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine nor there were additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.

She is running a fever, has chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite because she is nauseous; all on 06Jan2021 at 06:00. This is the third day of it.  She would like to know what she can she do. She said that it all started Wednesday morning when she got up. It just gets worse every day.  It looks like it would get better by now, but it hasn&#39;t.  She never runs a temperature, but she has now (unspecified date).  She is still freezing to death on unspecified date. She usually has a good appetite.  Even the thought of food makes her sick. She further reported that she has had nothing but chills, fever, and nausea and states it will not go away. She is treating it with ibuprofen. She confirms she already talked to a nurse in this department to report this and she was transferred to see what she could do and states they never answered. This is her first dose and she does not know if she should get the second dose. The patient can&#39;t calm down since she has been sick since last Wednesday. She stated that she needed some help because she is so sick. She was suggested to call again calling Pfizer medical information department. She stated that she had called back three times, but there is no such number. The events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous were considered serious (Other medically important condition). The outcome of the events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous was not recovered, and the outcome of the remaining event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completed based on known safety profile and a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 79-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246, expiration date unknown), intramuscular on the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 14:15 to 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient previously received flu vaccine and experienced a slight reaction to the flu vaccine, she does not recall when she had it. She got it in the supermarket (she was told one vaccine was super and one flu vaccine was regular, and she had the super vaccine and she thinks that is why she had the side effects). She does not know the name of the flu vaccine or have lot number to provide. The patient was calling about the COVID vaccine that she received a couple of days ago. She received the first dose on Friday, 08Jan2021. She wanted to call and report the side effects. She had a mild headache and was tired. She started feeling tired on Saturday, reported that she felt wiped out. It was reported that the events headache and feeling tired both started on Saturday (09Jan2021). It was also reported that she is about 5&#39;1&#34;, she thinks she lost an inch, and that her headache is going away - it was not a major headache, not a migraine. She also took Tylenol as treatment. Her tiredness went away about 48 hours later, and confirmed she recovered completely as of that day. She was alarmed at first and she was wondering where the headache was coming from. She read the paperwork she received, and it is listed as a side effect. She was told that there may be some soreness when she went in to get the vaccine. The event tired, feeling wiped out resolved on 11Jan2021 while the mild headache was resolving and the outcome of the event she thinks she lost an inch was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included major reaction to eating conch, and tested positive for COVID on 22Nov2020 There were no concomitant medications. Patient read that was not a good thing to do, to get the vaccine after only 2 months instead of 3 from diagnoses. When she had COVID she had major headache, chills, and diarrhea.

                                                I am very allergic.  I have had reactions in past to flu vaccine.  My allergist told me to take a Zyrtec in the morning and evening for 2 days before taking the Covid vaccine.  I did that and also took chlorpheniramine on the date I received the vaccine (I do not like Zyrtec.  it is too strong).   I had no immediate reaction;  I waited 40 minutes at the hospital and then went home.  3 hours later my throat became very scratchy and sore.  I took another chlorpheniramine pill and went to sleep for about 1 hour.  When I got up, the scratchiness had gone. About 3 years ago, after a regular flu shot, my throat became scratchy 45 min. after the shot.   My dr at the time said I should not get flu shots again.  Then he died.  My new dr was very big on the flu shot.  I did it in his office.  That time, the reaction occurred 20 min after the shot.  I did not get flu shots thereafter.  However, with the severity of the Covid  epidemic, I decided to get the Covid shot.  I spoke to my allergist, who told me to take Zyrtec in the morning and at night two days before the shot so I would have a lot of antihistamine in my system.  I did that.  I did not take it on the day of the shot because it is too strong.  On the day of the Covid shot I took chlorpheniramine. I was fine after the shot.  I only had the reaction 3 hours later.

This 79 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284) in left arm, on 18Jan2021 at 12:00 PM or 01:00 PM, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pacemaker (she just had it checked on 18Jan2021 at the cardiologist and they said it was good for five more years), heart issue, dementia (before getting the vaccine). Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Jan2021 the patient experienced dementia (she had a bit of dementia right now, which she also had before getting the vaccine) and her feet felt like they were numb, like neuropathy (maybe she had that, it had never been checked). Since 19Jan2021 the patient could not walk, had difficulty in walking. She was using a cane as she did not want to fall, she weighed 200 lbs and her partner would never be able to get her up if she fell. She was able to walk with the cane. The patient said that there had been no other treatment for her difficulty in walking and it seemed to get better. The initial caller (patient&#39;s partner) said she had the shot too on 18Jan2021 and did not have those symptoms, she was not the one who was sick, she did not know what else was going on in her partner&#39;s body, they did not think the shot caused it. The patient said she was supposed to be on a sleep apnea machine but she could not get in to the doctor to get the machine checked, it needed a test to be rechecked but they could not get in to do it because of everything that is going on. The patient was scheduled to get the second dose on 08Feb2021 at 10:00AM. Difficulty in walking was improving. The other events outcome was unknown.

                                                Felt fine the day of event, during the night she felt like she had a heavy head, but when she woke up around 8:00 and she realized that something was very wrong, she could not sit up due to nausea and the room spinning.  She texted her daughter who is a nurse and got there about 1:00 PM, she was still in bed.  When she tried to sit her up she felt like she was going to throw up.  She put her legs over to the side of the bed, and she felt like somebody was pushing her with her daughter over a cliff, in a tornado and on a Ferris wheel.  She started vomiting and having diarrhea.  She had heard about an epley maneuver and after a time she sat her up again and still had the previous feeling of going off a mountain in a tornado.  She did the epley maneuver and tilter her head to the left and was still very dizzy but not as bad.  She then tilted her head to the right and it was not as bad.   Things started to settle down and eventually she was able to get up, still nauseated but 90% better.  She was able to go to the restroom with her daughter&#39;s help.  She stayed in the bed all that day and finally in the evening was abler to keep food down.   She limited her distance to the bed to the bathroom.   Her doctor was notified and called in some nausea  and vertigo medicine (meclizine), which he did and only took 2 doses of that.  The next morning she went up and down the stairs to make sure she was able to.  She was very, very cautious but each day has been better.  On 2/2/21 she called and got an APT with ENT but will not see him in a couple of weeks.  They are going to send a therapist tomorrow to evaluate her for the vertigo.  She is scheduled for the 2nd vaccine on 2/11/21.   Saw her internist today and he evaluated her and did 2 blood tests and sent the referral for the therapist to come tomorrow.

Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.  Encephalitis immune antibodies are pending, myositis panel, MOG antibodies ADEM are pending, GAD65 antibody pending.

A 79-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EL8982) on 16Jan2021 14:30 at single dose in right arm for to prevent Covid-19. Medical history included ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome, hypertension.  Prior vaccinations, the patient maybe tired and unwell from the flu vaccine and shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for immunization. There were no concomitant medications.  No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient got her first vaccine on 16Jan2021. About 3 days later, on 19Jan2021, she was really tired but it only lasted for that one day. States that on 19Jan2021, 20Jan2021, and 21Jan2021, her blood pressure shot way up and she went to the ER on 21Jan2021 because it had been so high for a few days.

Monday night around 9pm I had a fever 101.3, my normal pain lever increased bad, and my balance of worse than normal, to walk 20 yards I had to stop at least 5 times because my back was hurting so bad. The next day, I woke up with normal fever but there was redness on the injection site a little larger than a silver dollar, around 8 my fever went up to 100. The next night, Wednesday night my fever was at 99.6, the next day my temp was normal and continued to be the rest of the time. The redness on my arm started fading and has continued to fade but I can still see where it is.

                                                sinus infection; cannot see out of her right eye; sick; terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple; can&#39;t sleep; pressure behind her right eye; head is all fuzzy; mind isn&#39;t good; throat hurts; jaw hurts; little off balance; she walks she falls into things; she walks she falls into things; can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye; pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  Concomitant medication included atenolol for blood thinner.  The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. The patient stated that she received the second dose of the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and has been sick ever since. She has a terrible terrible splitting headache on her right temple and can&#39;t sleep and was having so much pressure behind her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t even lay her head on a pillow. She stated she had no reaction to the first shot but this time her head is all fuzzy, her mind wasn&#39;t good and when she sets things down she can&#39;t remember where they are. The second shot was really giving her a fit. Her throat hurts, jaw hurts, head hurts, and feels like she is running a temperature. She is a little off balance, when she walks she falls into things because she can&#39;t see things hardly in her right eye. She stated she can&#39;t put up with the pain any longer, it is terrible behind her temple and eye. She thought it was a sinus infection but now she thinks it was from the shot. She stated she almost had a wreck today because she cannot see out of her right eye because of the shot. She hit a telephone thing and almost wrecked 3 or 4 times. She tried to get tested for Covid but she didn&#39;t have an appointment and she cannot go to work until she finds out about the virus. She was going to get tested tomorrow but was going to have to call the rescue squad because she can&#39;t drive and she was not putting her son through this if she has the virus. The patient asked if she was allergic to the second shot or if these were normal symptoms. She asked what she should do. She stated she takes Atenolol, a blood thinner, and thyroid medicine. She stated she was taking Tylenol but it doesn&#39;t help any and nothing seems to help. All the events occurred on Feb2021. Outcome of all the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 (lot number: EL3286) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fever. The patient reported that she had her shot this morning (29Jan2021) at about 08:30 and towards evening, the shot started to hurt and so she wanted to make sure that it didn&#39;t go against anything, and put a little ice on it or maybe it was worthless on ice on certain situations after the fact that she thought this was too late. She wanted to make sure she could do that. The patient&#39;s blood pressure also went up on 29Jan2021. She was taking several different medicines for blood pressure. She took them already tonight. She was hoping that she will be feeling a little bit better. Sometimes, she gets a little fever on Jan2021, also like maybe 99 (unspecified). She just wanted to know if any of the medications were good or not for the shot. The patient was asking whether the drugs interacted. The patient also reported that when she took her first shot, she had a little fever and asked what she could take for it. An agent stated that she could take paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she took her pills, otherwise, her head felt like it was going to explode on Jan2021. She took her high blood pressure medicines. She has three medications namely clonidine, losartan and propranolol. She has a lot of medical conditions that was why she was calling because she takes other medications. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 78-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3286), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included clonidine, losartan and propranolol. It was reported that the patient called after the first shot also which was on the 8th. She called on 9th because she got a fever and I asked if she can take a medication because she is trying to figure out if it is same thing interacting with anything. The outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Three days after second vaccine, I started to get sore in left shoulder, two hours later the pain had moved up my neck. By nighttime I could barely move my head to the left and pain was severe.  i was very chilled and could hardly stop shivering until I took a heating pad and dressed warmly and went to bed.  Sunday, still have a lot of pain and taking aspirin for the pain.  Also will use SalonPas for the painful areas to see if that helps.  Still cannot move my head to the left without pain.

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 02Feb2021 12:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, knee surgery, and bulging disc.  The patient had an MRI on an unspecified date in Jan2021 (a week and a half prior to the date of initial report) with result of bulging disc. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate (ARNUITY ELLIPTA) for asthma; She was supposed to take 1 puff a day. However, being in the house, she had no problems, she had maybe used it twice a week since she hasn&#39;t had any problems, she last took 1 puff on 01Feb2021). She was also taking vitamin pills concomitantly. On 04Feb2021 23:00, 2 days after the vaccine, the patient had sweats, was wringing wet, and was not feeling well. Her hair was wet, and she was sweating. She was okay on the morning of 05Feb2021 but not herself. She had a little nausea on 05Feb2021. She was just not quite herself on 05Feb2021 but doesn&#39;t have the sweats. She further reported that she had her first shot on 02Feb2021 12:00. She was fine and had no problems. However, on night of 04Feb2021, before bed, she started getting hot and sweaty, like she was wringing wet. She didn&#39;t feel good, but 2 days had gone by and she was fine. She also went to bed with something like chills (later clarified as not chills), she went to sleep on the morning of 05Feb2021 and felt okay but not that great. When queried when the chills started, she said that it was not really chills, she was just very sweaty, wringing wet. She stated that she never sweats, and in this case her whole hair was wet. Being older, she was wondering what was going. Her feeling hot and sweaty subsided during the night. She did start to feel nausea, or she thought maybe she hasn&#39;t had anything to eat and so had a half banana and then she was okay. She thought she was hungry and felt funny, she had the half banana and was okay. She also felt a little shaky and nervous on 04Feb2021; however, it all subsided after going to bed. At the date of report, 05Feb2021, she felt okay but she didn&#39;t feel completely herself. Her second dose is scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:15 AM. Outcome of events feeling hot and sweaty was recovered with sequel on 05Feb2021. Outcome of event not feeling well was unknown. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 05Feb2021. Outcome of the events shaky and nervous was recovered on 04Feb2021. Outcome of she was just not quite herself was not recovered.

I also had more drainage than normal from my head.  During night I felt a fierce sore throat.  Next day, sinus headache, slight sore throat, additional drainage from head.  Last meal that day was lunch.  Going to bed, I vomited.  Next day, sinus headache, drainage, cough and yellow phlegm from lungs--a cough.  Took Tylenol during these times.  Vomited before bed.  Next day I took Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold meds in a.m. and again in afternoon.  Felt better.  Ribs very sore from coughing.  Appetite began returning.  Congestion much improved.  Following day (today) still congested but improved.  No meds so far today.

It stopped after a few minutes as she went back to do more observation. Her blood pressure (BP) was measured high at the time. then from March 5-22 she had 5 nose bleeds, some can be stopped after a few minutes, some took a long time (one time it took 30 mins or more, and bled maybe 120ml and lastly on March 22 at 4am, the nose bleed can&#39;t be stopped, we called the ambulance). She&#39;s been self monitoring her BP at home since March 5, they were all normal, and just once a bit lower than usual. Besides the nose bleed, she also has been experiencing more mild headaches and fatigues. All of the 3 symptoms are rare for her, especially nose bleed. We already tried to use humidifier, be gentle when blowing nose, not eating spicy food.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

I had my second vaccine this past Friday at about 8 O&#39;clock between 8:15 in the morning. As the day went on I felt my arm is a little bit sore, no problem. Okay I went to bed and about 3 O&#39;clock in the morning, I woke up and I was shivering, I was so cold and I ached all over and I said okay I am getting the flu, went back to sleep, by the time I got up in the morning about 6 o&#39;clock the aching was gone but I could not walk, it was like I was drunk. I have a little dog and she was barking to go out and it was like 0 here so I sat there for a minute and I left her out and she started barking, to bring her back and I could not walk, I kept walking into the walls and my house was just this dark, I thought it&#39;s so dark in my house so I got my little dog back in, sat down and again and I thought what, maybe I will take my blood pressure, so I did and it was 66 over 48 so I though okay, so I started drinking, I thought I got to eat, I got to drink, so I get that, my pressure came up to 80 over 62 or something, my pulse rate was like 116, my O2 stat was like 98 percent so that was not a problem.

I was not taking any blood pressure medication, I mean I have but doctor took me off long time ago, I did not I mean I have no aches, I have no pains, I have nothing just a little bit of headache, not even enough to bother me, every now and then I think about it, I also, I mean I thought I have got to the bathroom, I had diarrhea terribly, something, I did not know if any of this is from the vaccine. I have not called my primary, I thought I called him tomorrow I mean I am fine, I am little short of breath when I walk up to the stairs but that is nothing unusual.&#34; Causality: Reporter stated &#34;I don&#39;t know, I am thinking it does I never had anything like this before but you know I don&#39;t know, I don&#39; know, I am just reporting it, I am 79 so I don&#39;t know how much this is, I don&#39;t know.&#34; When probed from where reporter got the vaccine, Reporter stated &#34;I got it the first one at (Institute name).&#34; LOT# of COVID-19 Vaccine administered on 22Jan2021: Reporter stated &#34;You know it&#39;s not on my little card, just the LOT# of second one is on here.

When they got results, they called her at home and told her that she had to call the ambulance and go the hospital in the ambulance, so she did; Ambulance to ER (hospital) on 11Mar2021. There was also a problem with the left ventricle of her heart (12 Mar2021 12:30). She stated whichever part pumps blood into the pulmonary vein, something is wrong there. She was going to have an echocardiogram to check that out again on 29Apr2021. She does not know the outcome of that yet until she gets that done. They gave her Eliquis as a blood thinner and oxygen.  She has not really needed the oxygen around the house.  But if she goes outside, she may. She took it to the grocery store with her and if she needed it, she used it.  She also had a headache after second dose on 24Feb2021 09:00. She felt tired on 24Feb2021 21:00 and stuff (as reported). The outcome of event blood clot in lung was unknown; the outcome of other events was recovering.

                                                Since the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, up to and including today, I have had daily periods of fogginess.  I feel as though I am wrapped in cotton and am seeing things from a distance.  These events generally go away in anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour.  Sometimes the recur in the same day, sometimes not.  When I am in the fogged state, when I take a step, I find I have no control of, or contact with my lower limbs and I stumble.  This has been going on for over a month.  And the feeling of exhaustion felt after dose #1 and dose #2 has continued intermittently.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6202; Expiry Date: 30Jun2021), administered in left arm on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 79-years) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced discomfort, mild malaise, trembling, on an unspecified date she says she feels a little fuzzy, like she was not thinking clearly and she says she was not able to do anything due to exhaustion. she has been having three days of discomfort and mild malaise for a week. The patient says she was not able to do anything due to exhaustion, so she thought Pfizer would want to know. She says that she could not type due to trembling to complete a report online. Patient second dose was on 26Mar2021, and they did not ask for her vaccine card, so she does not have and was not able to provide NDC/LOT/EXP from the second dose. She says that the NDC was not provided on her vaccine card for the first dose. The patient mentions a COVID test, but says that this was just a paper, she had forgot that she had a card, the test was to do a job. Patient says it was the second dose that she had a reaction after. She says she got both doses in her left arm. She says her reaction was discomfort and mild malaise beginning Saturday. Patient said that it has not got better or worse, she was having intermittent trembling periods where she would feel ok but then start shaking and be exhausted again, so it has been about the same since Saturday. Patient said that she will be ok for a couple hours, and then it will all start again, and she will shake all over. Patient felt a little fuzzy, like she was not thinking clearly, and so tired and trembling. The patient said that her prolonged reaction was not enough to go to the hospital, but she was not feeling so good, and thinks maybe people should be warned. The patient did not receive any treatment for adverse event. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Hypertension; Tachycardia; Extreme flushing to face and neck; glowing red; took her pulse and it was 145; Persistent head to toe macular erythematous Rash; Dull Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient).  A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered on the left arm on 21Apr2021 13:12 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia (diagnosed more than 20 years ago), bladder cancer (diagnosed 13 years ago the first time, 8 reoccurrences and has been cancer free for 2 years, cancer free for 2 years), multi drug allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic /chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, diabetes, and obesity. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, levothyroxine, and oxazepam. No vaccines received within 2 weeks. In 12 minutes after the injection on 21Apr2021, while she was still sitting in the parking lot, patient developed tachycardia on and extreme flushing to face and neck on 13:20.  They were as red as being in the sun.  She was aware of tachycardia first.  Then she looked in the mirror and was glowing red. Patient was observing in parking lot and took her pulse and it was 145. Persistent head to toe macular erythematous rash occurred next.  They took her to the ER about 20 minutes after the injection. In the ER, she was given 25mg of Benadryl IV and 125 mg of Solumedrol IV.  When both of those wore off the next day, the generalized rash came back on Thursday (22Apr2021).  The rash was persistent but not as flushed looking as before. When they got her into ER, the first blood pressure reading was 198/117, which was within 20 minutes of injection. Hypertension was experienced on 13:30. Her blood pressure usually was fairly low and was back to normal now. She had one reading of 124/76 to 170/something. Her normal range is anywhere between 150-170/70-80&#39;s. She is on Lisinopril. The other morning when it was 124/76, was just a fluke. That was an unusually good reading. They did a regular panel of lab work when she went to the ER. They did not tell her that anything was abnormal.  She asked them to run an A1C, but they told her they could not. They did a chest film, EKG, placed IV to give medications, but no fluids given. Her doctor said not to get second dose of the vaccine.  She had it at the hospital and they had reports of other people with a rash. The patient considered the events tachycardia, extreme flushing, macular erythematous rash and hypertension were medically significant while for headache was non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were possibly causally related to the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  This case will be reassessed should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At that time her temperature was 97.3. She felt fine the rest the day.   At 1 AM she woke up with shakes. She continued with nausea and that resulted in vomiting and then diarrhea. She also had severe pain in her thighs. This was severe enough that she called the ambulance.   Patient also relates later that she had had some burning on urination 2 days prior to the vaccination. She had leftover Macrodantin that she took 9 PM yesterday.   Also relates back in December she was seen by Dr for vaginal infection and 2 times a week she has to administer intravaginal antibiotics.

She also relates she has an enlarged spleen and is followed by Dr.   In the emergency room she was noted to be febrile and hypotensive. She received a total of 5 L of normal saline in the ER to bring her pressures up with a systolic below 100. She has a very elevated procalcitonin as well as lactic acid. Urine is positive for large amount of blood and small leukocyte esterase  Hospital Course 79 y.o. year old female with HTN, infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast stage I status post lumpectomy with positive margins was on anastrozole but taken off secondary to abnormal liver enzyme testing, CLL/thrombocytopenia stage I with no treatment needed, fatty liver complicated by portal hypertension/splenomegaly resulting in bleeding esophageal varices, history of viral cardiomyopathy in 2006, B12 deficiency, history of admission for septic shock, chronic diarhea, presented to the emergency room on 2/14 complaining of fevers, myalgias fatigue nausea and vomiting 24 hours after having a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Went to bed, woke up soaking wet, diarrhea, vomiting, dizzy.    She did not have skin feeling funny like with regular flu, but mostly all intestinal.  She changed her clothes and then was shivering and could not get warm, and had hard shaking chills.  She slept very little and has had it continuous since the vaccine.  She has been falling a sleep a lot, day, night and was previously very active and now falls asleep at a drop of a hat.  Over the past week and a half has had the cold chills less, but has awakened moist.   She is having the diarrhea and GI issues less, but feels nauseous at times during the day.   She is still waking up between 11:00 and 2:00 waking up, but falls sleep a lot, does not have a regular schedule as she did before.   It is not debilitating as much but still tired a lot.

Per patient, she was gardening last week and developed chest pressure/SOB when moving around some mulch this lasted on and off for 3 days and then was followed by intense fatigue which persisted today so she came into ED. She was placed in observation for chest pain, and to rule out ischemia. Upon admission, a COVID-19 test was run for screening, and was positive. Other than fatigue and chest pain, she was not endorsing other symptoms and did not have hypoxia or coughing at all.  Although on admit, there was plan to get a stress test, given the COVID-19 diagnosis, this was deferred. She was discharged to home in stable condition on 5/5.

A 79-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Formulation: Solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0150; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left upper on 24May2021 11:30 AM (at the age of 79-year-old), as 1st dose, 0.3 ML single dose, for COVID-19 immunization.

(Patient Had headache, took Aspirin in 20 minutes had severe reaction-like never seen. Did not go to hospital, never felt throat closing off, coughing, trouble breathing. Skin felt on fire inside and out, took everything off, ice cold shower, skin beet red felt on fire all over, skin looked like elephant skin, wavy; Neighbor nurse gave her liquid Benadryl she drank. Within 15 minutes everything started to clear up, never been near Aspirin again). Patient has allergy to Advil from 1985 To Ongoing. (Had Severe reaction. Did not go to hospital, never felt throat closing off, coughing or trouble breathing. Couple years later had new job picked up fever from little kids coming in.

On her right hand the numbness was still there. Patient underwent EMG test and a couple weeks later he told her he thought she has carpel tunnel. The concomitant medications include Eliquis taken for pulmonary embolisms (2.5 mg, 2x/day) from unspecified date of Jan2017 to ongoing. Synthroid taken for thyroid problem from unspecified date to unspecified date. Eliquis has to be a pretty powerful drug; don&#39;t know about Pfizer Covid Vaccines, wondered if something interacted because excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers took a little over 4 days after Pfizer Covid Vaccine for onset. The patient previously took (years ago) hepatitis vaccine, shingles vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, no reactions to those; she was very cautious did not leave the office too soon after vaccines. She never got flu shot; when she was first in nurses training, she had a reaction to the flu vaccine in like 1960 and was in the emergency room. This retired Registered Nurse was the patient who called regarding her first dose of Pfizer Covid Vaccine. She reported tiredness; eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see; excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand; She couldn&#39;t move her fingers. She also mentioned red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site. She reported she had absolutely no symptoms, nothing after the Pfizer Covid Vaccine other than tiredness, feeling kind of tired, that&#39;s about it. On27May2021 in the afternoon she had onset of her eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes. She washed her eyes out, and the burning and watering went away after she washed them. She had no make-up on, no eye make-up on for a few days at that time. Otherwise, everything was ok. She went to bed last night and during the night she woke up with excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand. She couldn&#39;t move her fingers for maybe a minute or two. Eventually she was able to move her fingers a little, then more and more and the event stopped, she kind of went back to normal and fell asleep. A couple of hours later she had the same event reoccur, just down to the hand, all 10 fingers, couldn&#39;t move them for a few minutes and then after that she could, they seemed to be ok, and she fell asleep again. Whether event started 27May2021 or 28May2021 is unknown, unknown onset times. She has been fined all day. She has written checks out, made meals, coffee, washed and dressed herself, had no other problems. At her age it was hard to tell when the tiredness started regarding time of onset. Thinks in the evening of 24May2021 she felt onset, tired and the next day on 25May2021 she had a couple episodes where her arms felt really heavy just for a short time maybe 30 seconds and then the episodes went away and she just felt tired. 26May2021 she noticed she was not as tired, and yesterday and today improved, feeling pretty good. Seriousness of all the events was not specified by reporter. The outcome of the events eyes really burning and watering, she almost could not see for a few minutes was recovered on 27May2021. Time of onset: late morning, probably about 11:00-11:30 really burned, then eyes started to really, really water. She was familiar with her house so she held onto furniture to get to the bathroom and as soon as she rinsed her eyes out event never happened again. Her eyes are not bothering her.The outcome of excruciating pain in all 10 fingers, just to the area that connects to the hand, nothing in her palm or hand and couldn&#39;t move her fingers was resolved on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the event tiredness and red mark about the size of a quarter at injection site was recovering.  Follow up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on close temporal association the causal association between the reported event she almost could not see for a few minutes with the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The contributory effect of the patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications also need to be considered. The case will be reassessed should the additional information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. About lot, the reporter doesn&#39;t know if it is an L or a C, 3249, and thinks it is a C. Age at vaccination was 80-years-old. Medical history included blood pressure high. Concomitant medications included lisinopril for blood pressure high plus an unspecified long list. When she got the shot, she got bruise on the injection site about the size of a half dollar. She has headache too, first two days. Onset of headache was reported as 8th or 9th day after vaccination (Jan2021). The patient is supposed to go back on the 29th.

An 80-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via unspecified route of administration, on right arm, on 14Jan2021 15:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination Facility type was at Health department gave it at the fairgrounds. Medical history included ongoing COPD, blood pressure high, GERD, former smoker she quit 30 years ago, had COVID while she was in a rehab center in Aug2020, for which she said it felt like bronchitis; broke her hip last August (Aug2020). Ongoing concomitant medications included hydrochlorothiazide, telmisartan (TELMISARTAN HCTZ) for blood pressure high, pantoprazole for GERD, vitamins, ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), zinc, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), magnesium. On 15Jan2021, patient had a 101F fever, a headache and chills all day. Her concern was that she had never had any kind of reaction to any kind of vaccine before. From what she&#39;s heard, people have had a worse reaction to the 2nd shot, and since the first shot was so bad she was worried about getting the 2nd one. She was scheduled for her 2nd dose on 02Feb2021, and she had an appointment scheduled with a specialist on 03Feb2021. The morning after getting the vaccine, she woke up and got dressed but kept thinking that she was cold so she put on an extra sweater. Stated that even with the extra sweater on, she still had the chills, then she started to get the headache, and then she took her temperature. Stated that she had also had a sore arm, it&#39;s finally starting to feel better today. The outcome of event sore arm was resolving, outcome of other events were resolved on 16Jan2021.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot: EL8982) intramuscular in right arm on 22Jan2021 at 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Gastroparesis from 2016 and ongoing, ongoing Osteoarthritis (diagnosed about 10 to 20 years before), acid reflux (esophageal), blood pressure, osteoporosis, arthritis, anxiety, high cholesterol, stomach problems, allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, leg cramps at night, allergic to all kind of bites. Patient previously took shingles vaccine as immunization and she had had a small reaction, she had a patch of shingles break out around her arm at the site of injection site. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for Gastroparesis, ongoing erythromycin, ongoing aluminum hydroxide/magnesium carbonate (GAVISCON) for acid reflux (esophageal), ongoing calcium for Osteoporosis, ongoing losartan for Blood pressure, ongoing acetaminophen for arthritis, ongoing spironolactone as diuretic, ongoing tramadol for Osteoarthritis, vitamin C [ascorbic acid] as general supplementation, ongoing alprazolam for Anxiety, ongoing doxazosin for high blood pressure, ongoing fenofibrate for High cholesterol, ongoing vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX) as general supplementation, ongoing bisoprolol for high blood pressure, ongoing magnesium good for heart recommended by cardiologist, ongoing biotin for hair and nails, ongoing zinc as immunity booster, ongoing montelukast sodium for allergies and pretty bad sinus problems/sinus trouble in the winter, ongoing levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) for allergies, ongoing cyclobenzaprine for leg cramps at night as muscle relaxer, ongoing macrogol 3350 (MIRALAX) as laxative and ongoing &#34;CVS brand multivitamin at one tablet once a day oral as general supplementation&#34; (as reported).The patient experienced face felt hot and flushed and face red on 24Jan2021; gray spot on forehead on 25Jan2021; was tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot, face was burning and burned bright red face feeling sunburned in Jan2021.Events were described as follows: patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 22Jan2021 and she had a few mild symptoms. She did not feel really good for a day or two but it was nothing that alarmed her, she was tired and wiped out. She always took a shower since she had arthritis and it get gets her joints going. On 24Jan2021 after she got out of the shower, her face felt hot and it was red. She didn&#39;t think too much about it and it went away pretty soon. She did not connect it with the vaccine. On 25Jan2021 she took a little longer shower and the same thing happened, but it was 10 or 12 times worse in regards to her face feeling hot and was red. She was drying off and getting dressed and reported her face felt funny and it was really hot. When she looked at it was bright red like she had the worst sunburn, it felt like a sunburn. Her face was red and eyes were red bloodshot and it lasted about half an hour; her face got real flushed like a real bright sunburn and her face was burning and burned bright red. She started putting on cold wet wash cloths to help cool her face down and when it the wash cloths got warm, she would wet it again to cool her face down some more. She was alarmed but about 30 minutes later it started lightening up a bit and pretty soon it was back to normal. Her face felt different in the afternoon, it was a little red. She worked out in yard and last summer she got an insect bite on her forehead that turned gray, it was the size of silver dollar. After the hot flush thing this morning, that gray spot came back. Her doctor said it might take a while for it to go away. Her face felt warm like it has been sunburned. Her throat was dry since she has been waiting on the phone for an hour. Her face feeling sunburned/hot was about 95% gone, barely there. Her face getting red started on 24Jan2021 morning and it was almost gone. Treatment included ponds face cream and it was very soothing. Patient just wanted to know what to do about this flushing of her face and if it was dangerous what she can  do. She would like to know if she should be worried about this, it only happened when she took a shower. She was asking if there was anything she can do before she can get the second injection, so it does not happen again or what to do if it does happen again. Final outcome of tired and wiped out, eyes were red bloodshot and face was burning and burned bright red/her face feeling sunburned/ face got really like the worst sunburn was unknown; outcome of the other events was not recovered.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

I did not feel good on Sunday, so I ate very little that day and my sugar was about 42 points higher than normal.  On  Monday, I had the same breakfast and lunch that I normally have -- no changes in routine and  my sugar had jumped 60 points when checked just prior to dinner.  Today it is still abnormally high (30 points higher), even when  checked first thing in the morning. Since my sugar is pretty stable, if I watch what I eat this is extremly unusual. and occurred after the second vaccine shot. I believe the sugar readings are decreasing steadily and will see how they are today and tomorrow.

                                                Fatigue started late morning 2/17; fleeting low-grade headaches started later on 17th or on 18th.  Fatigue has continued since it started on the 17th. Headaches last 30 seconds or a minute or two, then are gone, but return shortly after. Headache appears to be centered on the top of the head, slightly to the rear and to the left. It has not interfered with my sleep, as I am sleeping much more than normal.

On a scale of 1-10 the symtoms were 7-8 I also developed a rash on my arms as if I had been burned.  I had to use  an inhaler that I already  had and I ussed Hydocortisone cream on the rash  I saw the Nurse Practicioner on 2/10 2021 and was given Medrol 4mg tabs Today I am still coughing with slight tightness in my chest and the ras is resolving but scars linger.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on her left arm on 30Jan2021 to 30Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took phenytoin sodium (DILANTIN) and carbamazepine (TEGRETOL) and experienced allergy as her reaction to those were sometime between 2010 and 2012. On 30Jan2021 after three and a half hours, the patient felt sensation at her foot for that she could not walk, experienced chills, hands were shaking, had a swollen ankle and foot and pain. Around 5 o clock, the patient stated that it was like a strange sensation in her foot and she also got chills. By 7 o clock, she was in pain. The patient stated that she took two Tylenol. The patient stated that at around 9 o clock, she noticed that her ankle and foot were swollen with red blotches on it so she took two Benadryl and then slept until noon. The patient stated that Benadryl actually gave her some relief, although the pain didn&#39;t completely subside, but it subsided a little so that it was more tolerable. The patient stated that she had been debating if she should have gone to the emergency room (ER), but she didn&#39;t because she has a high pain tolerance. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9266 and expiry date 31May2021, via unspecified route of administration on 15Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, broke her elbow from 04Dec2020 and surgery from 12Dec2019 and second surgery was from 15Jul2020; the patient thought that the second surgery on her arm was in 2020 and she actually broke her arm in 2019. She thinks it was actually Dec2019 when she broke her arm and the second surgery was on 15Jul2020; ongoing with the arm the pain and movement in that arm (movement disorder) and arm; weakened (same arm that she broke). There were no concomitant medications. The patient was taking the same medications she always takes, and she waited until after the dose to take them. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 lot number EL02162, expiry date 31May2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient was calling about the vaccine, the second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She experienced some side effects, there was joint pain on 15Feb202 later that nigh and the most obvious thing was exhaustion that began later the same day as well; but one thing was unusual, the strange side effect that has happened on 16Feb2021 was that her hand felt like it was sleeping especially her finger tips it felt like neuropathy but it was much better now, it was the same arm that she broke, it seemed weaker now which it seemed like the side effects go to areas that were weakened before. The patient stated that the main thing was the neuropathy thing, it felt like she was sitting on her hand and that persisted, but it was 90 percent better and she thinks it will go away. The neuropathy feeling was ongoing but much less, it was improved it happens only if she squeezes her hand so it was much less and she hoped it just dissipates. The patient&#39;s main concern was the neuropathy and it has improved a great deal. The patient mentioned with the arm the pain and movement in that arm has worsened since the injection (Feb2021).

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1687), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, at the age of 80 years, on 29Jan2021 17:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cataract, arthritis and seasonal allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications.The patient stated that a couple of times she did not feel good and got very sore and could not bend over to pick things up and her eyes blurred up.

Then the next day she was stiffer than ever and she couldn&#39;t bend over. She added her eyes were blurry, they felt like she had a cold in them, and she felt pressure in them. She added she always has this problem with her eyes but it got a little worse after the shot. All of that has gotten better now. It was stated they are telling her the second dose was worse and she was unsure about getting the second dose. Also mentioned they were saying you can wait a little longer and she was unsure if maybe she should wait. She wanted to ask about getting the second dose. She added she was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 19Feb2021. The patient said it was right sided back pain. She said she applied heading pad and took ibuprofen. She also experienced &#34;eye pressure&#34; and &#34;blurry eyes&#34;, &#34;how you feel when you have a bad head cold&#34;. She said, &#34;I have allergies-seasonal, so this isn&#39;t new to me&#34;.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of back pain (back pain). The outcome of the events did not feel good, eyes were blurry/ she felt pressure in them and  bad head cold was unknown while other events were recovered on 31Jan2021.

At first, they were days apart.  Then they started coming closer together.  Yesterday, I had the headache all day until I fell asleep and awoke today (3/5/2l) with just a slight feeling of pressure over my eyes.  Could the vaccination have triggered this?  Could that first headache the day after my vaccination irritated some nerve in that area and started this?  I have never had any headaches unless I had a sinus infection and I don&#39;t have any sign of this now.  I

                                                completely covered with a rash; I was very tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included thyroid disorder; patient also stated, &#34;I have sinus and allergies because I am allergic to dust. Dust is everywhere. I get the runny nose.&#34; Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid. The patient reported &#34;I have the vaccine on 3rd of this month and I had the Pfizer one and I was fine except I was very tired. I ended up going bed around 8 O&#39;clock which is not like me but I was just so tired and then I woke up around 10 O&#39;clock completely covered with a rash. So I took I had and allergy pills that had Benadryl in it so I took that and went to the bed. Next day all of it was gone. It was little bit left on my right cheek and my neck. I don&#39;t know if I still go for the other vaccine, this 24 or not. I didn&#39;t have temperature or anything.&#34; About the start date of the event, the patient further stated, &#34;It was the 3rd between 10 or 10:30 in the night. It was 9 hours after I had the shot. I didn&#39;t have reaction right away, I was fine except I was tired, 9 hours later I have the rash.&#34; The patient stated that she was fine. Treatment for the event rash includes allergy pills that has Benadryl. The patient also asked if it was okay to go for second shot on the 24th. The patient was recovering from the rash while outcome of tiredness was not yet recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Myocarditis/had another virus that went to her heart; trouble remembering; incredible fatigue; could sleep around the clock; brain fog; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (Patient). An 80-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265), intramuscular at Right Deltoid from on 16Feb2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included stomach was burning, heartburn, low thyroid, myocarditis and was hospitalized a year ago, Milroy&#39;s disease, and low potassium, heart disorder and Back disorder. Concomitant medications included bumetanide (BUMEX) Has been taking for about 40 years for Milroy&#39;s disease, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) from Jan2020 for Myocarditis, levothyroxine Has been taking for 40 years for low thyroid, tramadol Started about 10-12 years ago for back, metoprolol from Jan2020 for heart, omeprazole (PROTONIX) Started taking about 8 years ago for stomach was burning and heartburn, potassium Has taken for 40-50 years for low potassium, vitamin B12, vitamin D3 and baby aspirin 81mg, all were ongoing. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL8982) on an unknown date for covid-19 immunization and she got a really sore arm. The patient experienced Myocarditis/had another virus that went to her heart on an unspecified date, brain fog on 17Feb2021, trouble remembering on an unspecified date, incredible fatigue on 17Feb2021, could sleep around the clock on 17Feb2021. The clinical course as following: injection was on 16Feb2021. She has had incredible fatigue. She was asking how long is the fatigue going to last. She knows it is a side effect but she could sleep around the clock. She stated she goes to bed at 6PM if not before then and gets up at around 8AM and by 9AM she could go back to bed. She is sorry she got the shot because she is miserable. She mentioned she has been reading up on the vaccine and it said &#34;you might have fatigue for a day or two&#34;. Her fatigue has now been 8 days. She thought &#34;how long is this going to go on&#34;.  Patient reported that with the first shot she got a really sore arm. Stated she thinks the person giving the injection put the darn thing through her bone. She thought it was to be expected, but it feels like the person who administered the vaccine was a poor shot giver. She provides the first Covid Vaccine Lot number: EL8982. With the second shot her arm did not get sore at all. The only thing she&#39;s having was the fatigue, she can hardly walk past her bed without wanting to get back in it. She tries to get up to shower and fix her hair and be motivated and she&#39;s been fighting the fatigue all day to not get back in bed. When probed for the seriousness criteria of the fatigue, the caller explains she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s that significant. She thought it will go away. However, she was just coming out of myocarditis. She was just in the hospital for myocarditis and they did a heart cath and she has no plugged arteries, nothing. They couldn&#39;t find anything other than she had another virus that went to her heart. She had another virus a year ago January. She wonders if COVID was out there then, because she had never been so sick with the flu. She kind of diagnosed her problem and it was like a wave over her body. She also had a terrible irregular pulse. When she went to the hospital the next morning, her cardiac enzymes were 4.5 times more than normal, her troponin was out of sight. She doesn&#39;t think that would have a bearing because she should be coming out of that myocarditis because of the medication the doctor put her on. She doesn&#39;t know if that would complicate it, too. Her heart doctor said a lot of people have myocarditis, especially athletes, but they are young and fall over dead. 90% of the time, its myocarditis because you don&#39;t know you have it.  She reports she&#39;s getting a foggy brain. Her son asked her who her dentist was because she had a root canal and she couldn&#39;t think of the dentist&#39;s name. She thinks her son threw that in because her son knew that she wouldn&#39;t be able to remember. She&#39;s not confused. It&#39;s just difficult to get the word out, but if she waits a couple minutes, she has the answer. She is also getting old, too. She lives by herself; she has no stimulation and she thinks that is significant to her circumstances. She thinks it&#39;s a problem with the COVID-19 injection. Caller explains she had blood work very recently about 2 weeks ago. She just looked at lab reports and everything was okay except one of the vitamins was a tiny bit high (she can&#39;t remember what the vitamin was), but nothing she was worried about. It could have been a Potassium was a little high, but she is not worried about that. Her main question is how long the fatigue last, she thought for only 1-2 days. She mentions she took her temperature every morning and its always like 97 something and it&#39;s never wavered. The outcome of the events brain fog, incredible fatigue, and could sleep around the clock was not recovered and the outcome of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, viral myocarditis is most likely due to a viral infection in this patient with cardiovascular co-morbidities and is not related to suspect product.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Mar2021 13:30 (at 80 years old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome, allergic to gluten, lecithin, and other barky parts of plants, high pressure, she did not hear very well, left breast surgery, skin cancer. She had a small skin cancer taken off each of her legs, one removed in Jan2020 and one removed in Feb2020. They are all healed up and they are fine, it was not the bad kind. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient experienced choking experience in which her throat tickled, and dizziness, dehydrated, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does, couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction all on 01Mar2021 with outcome of unknown.   Clinical course was reported as follows. She mentioned that she was fine for 20-30 minutes to an hour after she got home. That afternoon, she noticed that her bowel movement was regular, constant, and repeating which was not normal and would typically indicate SIBO (Small intestine bowel overflow) in which the colon empties everything. She mentioned that this was indicative of her gluten allergy. She reported having had bowel movements all afternoon which is a common allergic reaction she has to plants like lectin and gluten especially due to the irritable bowel system-her whole bowel system will empty and she will have to replace 2 days worth of food. With this event starting 01Mar2021 her bowels just kept emptying and emptying. During dinner while she was eating and watching tv, her heart started to pound (a rapid heartbeat), her ears started to ring (a pounding in her ears), she had pressure in her jaw, chest, head, ears, and allover, she had high pressure, and a choking episode in which her throat tickled, and dizziness that she couldn&#39;t get up. She took hot water for the tickling sensation and took one aspirin for the other symptoms, but she still did not feel very well. She went to bed at 9pm but couldn&#39;t sleep due to high adrenal stimulance, she only slept like 2-3 hours long which she can get from Novocaine with her teeth. She got up 3 times and excreted a cup of urine per time. In the morning, she woke up and excreted 1 cup of urine more than what she usually does. She got herself weighed and had a weight of 109lbs versus the normal 122lbs which indicated that she was really dehydrated so she took her fluids and ate breakfast. Other than this, she mentioned that she got up today and felt fine and feels that in 2 days she will be fine. She felt pretty good and she was going to run but did not dare burn any more calories or fluids so she is sitting still and taking it easy. Regarding outcome of event she reported the pounding pressure like high blood pressure are better, fine# she had a normal breakfast# she can get around and do whatever she needs around the house except she needs now to spend the day recouping from the dehydration so she needs pay attention to what she eats and drinks. She mentions that she runs 3-4 miles a day and tries to be active for her age. She is asking if she can take the 2nd dose in 3 weeks. She is unsure if this is an allergic reaction or something psychological. The outcome of the event was reported as recovering.

It became worse on the 22nd &amp; 23rd so for safety on the 24th  I had a &#34;nasal Covid-19 test&#34; done at a Urgent Care facility to determine if I had possibly contracted the Covid-19 virus.  The test came back &#39;negative&#39; -- I did not have an active case of Covid.  The symptoms I was experiencing finally calmed down about Friday - the 26th and by Sunday, they were over.  It was almost like a further delayed adverse reaction to my final March 6th 2nd dosage shot although the muscle &amp; joint aches and fatigue were worse than just after the 2nd shot?

In the days since then I have several bouts, every day, of wanting to sleep and spend hours drinking coffee and trying to stay awake.  What those shots have left me with is debilitating and I am afraid that I will be stuck with this for the rest of my life.  I read that  there is no cure for ME  If you can help, you have my contact information.  I would gladly be part of a study.

They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (states she was diagnosed about 40 years ago), Allergies, lung collapses (due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), preemie, no fusion in her eyes (States she sees out of one eye most of the time), does not retain sodium and potassium (related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), egg allergy. The patient previous received pneumonia and shingles vaccine for immunization and was fine, the first dose of the bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration in arm on unspecified date as single dose for covid-19 immunisation and fine. Concomitant medication included potassium as does not retain potassium; spironolactone; a list of medications. Her mom got her 2nd dose on Sunday and is in the process of needing to report that. She ended up with severe gut, lower abdominal, intestinal pain and bloating along with other normal things. States she saw her doctor yesterday and he believes it could be caused by the Propylene Glycol in the vaccine. Her mother received her shot at 3pm on 4Apr2021 and does not know which arm. Her symptoms started around 8:30 with body aches everywhere, a severe headache, her bones and joints were hurting so bad she couldn&#39;t barely walk much, she made it to the bathroom and that was it, and nausea. Caller states by 10 her mom had hard cramping, that it started at 8:30 with cramping in her abdomen and severe bloating. States her mom could still void but it was pressure tying to go and caused severe pain and abdominal pain was causing pain to void. Caller provides that her mom continues the same until Tuesday morning and then the intestinal cramping and bloating is still continuing now and it&#39;s more primarily her lower left area as of Wednesday. She has a big history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and her doctor that she met with yesterday feels this is probably from the propylene glycol component that caused the flare up, as she usually doesn&#39;t have this and he is hoping it will calm down in about a week. Her mom also couldn&#39;t eat or anything until Tuesday. She was down all of Sunday night and Monday for about 36 hours. Stated the voiding is somewhat better but not much better and the rest of the symptoms are consolidated and persisting. Reporter stated her mom can&#39;t go without her medications. Her mom did a virtual doctor visit and will follow up later this week. Her mother got the second dose of the vaccine and had severe intestinal pain, headache, joint pain, nausea, abdominal pain.

I had to go to a lot of doctors to figure out what they are going to do, and I am sleeping a lot, there is something wrong. I just want Pfizer to know just something not right with that. If you want also my husband but he came with me and he had shot with me. He had headache for five days but nothing else just the headache for 5 days from the same LOT.&#34; On 21Apr2021, information due to 2nd shot of Pfizer was again reported.

She passed out and didn&#39;t remember falling or feeling anything before falling. The patient also has a primary physician, but she had been seeing the plastic surgeon for this. The patient asked what does she do if she needs to get a booster. It scared her to death if she would have to take another shot. The patient asked (name) to hand her a pair of glasses to read the plastic surgeons name. She stated the printing is so small on there. She was supposed to see the doctor on 19Apr2021, but she didn&#39;t feel good enough to go see the doctor. For busted Mouth, they put in 3 layers of stitches.

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

An 80-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN9581), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 80-years-old) as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter stated that since then (having both doses of the vaccine), she has been to the emergency room 4 different times experiencing side effects. She has a metallic taste and horrible smell that she experienced in which it made her not want to eat or drink. She has minor hallucinations, chills, joint pain, and her tissue is tender. Her joint pain has improved. Then stated, &#34;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to die from it.&#34; She asked if anyone has reported these reactions previously and what should she do about them. Her family physician&#39;s nurse looked up a study in which 11% of the patients were experiencing a metallic taste. Also stated, &#34;This is very discouraging and depressing.&#34; The outcome of the event joint pain was recovering while of the rest was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of minor hallucinations cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

An 80-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Jan2021 15:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included visually handicapped and could not read her vaccine card; vertigo before, a year ago. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had her first COVID 19 vaccination, on 28Jan2021, about 3PM and she will get the booster on 22Feb2021, but it seemed like she had kind of vertigo on 29Jan2021, this just happened in the last hour, all of sudden she felt unbalanced, like her head was heavy, and she was holding onto things when she walked, She did call her primary doctor, he didn&#39;t think it had to do with the vaccine, so she thought to call and ask, she was fine, and then all of a sudden she started to get this kind of vertigo, he asked if her head was spinning, but it&#39;s not, it felt heavy and she has had vertigo before, a year ago, but she doesn&#39;t know. Her doctor told her to rest, so she was laying down, and when she lifted her head she could feel, it was not spinning, she knew she was not feeling balanced. When asked to clarify her question, states she wasn&#39;t sure this happening had anything to do with the vaccination, she called her primary care doctor and he thought it wasn&#39;t, had nothing to do with it, so she thought since she called, she would wait and talk to Pfizer in case, that other people have experienced the same thing. States she was hoping this agent could tell her it would go away in a little while, but her primary care doctor said it has nothing to do with it, but it may have to do with it, it was somewhat of a coincidence that was happened, and she was fine for 24 hours, all of a sudden she started to feel this whatever. States she did not need anything else at this time. Outcome of the event vertigo was not recovered and all other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

By night, muscle ache was continual and continued throughout the night.  Very difficult to walk. Sunday ... called Telehealth around noon, They triaged me into Dr.&#39;s office.  By Sunday afternoon, less discomfort, but still a headache. During this discomfort time, I would take 2 Tylenol (500 mg), which relieved it. Before I settled down for the night, I took 1 Tylenol and when I woke up at 3:00 a.m., the ache was not there (the Tylenol would have worn off by then). Monday a.m. ... could walk much better. The headache and the constant muscle ache are gone.  Nurse called; I am to keep watch, and if there are any changes for the worse, I will go into the Dr.&#39;s office.

Around 2 a.m. (36 hours after vaccination), severe stabbing pains radiating from colon up through ribs on left side. Only shallow breathing possible; any more than that brought unbearable pain. Took 10 mg. of Bentyl  and another 10 mg about an hour later. Pain subsided in less than an hour after 2nd dose. Discomfort &amp; occasional sudden pain in abdomen, along with achiness, through the next day. Continued to take Benadryl.  Dr. reachable by phone only said this probably not a repeat of the diverticulitis I have had several times over the past 15 years but simply spastic colon. By 3rd day, only mild abdominal distress &amp; mild fatigue. I do not know whether this experience is related to the vaccine at all. I had no difficulties after the 1st Covid vaccine.

                                                Patient was flushed and sweating, seemed to be a little dizzy. Vitals were all okay and within normal limits (BP, glucose, O2 Sat, HR).  I administered a Benadryl 50mg IM injection to the patient, and the hospital staff later gave her a dose of Zofran as she felt nauseous. Since then the patient seems to be reacting well to treatment.

An 81-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid, on 16Jan2021 (also reported as 15Jan2021), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included therapy for her back. There were no concomitant medications. After the patient got her first vaccine on 16Jan2021 (also reported as 15Jan2021) which was almost a week now, she was experiencing side effects. In Jan2021, the patient had chills, fever of 101, swollen lymph nodes, and aches. The patient had swollen glands or lymph nodes at the base of her skull, the lymph node venapathy (unspecified; as reported). The patient underwent a COVID-19 test yesterday (21Jan2021) to be sure (unknown results). The patient asked that if this is from the vaccine, how long could she expect to have these side effects. The patient was scheduled for it for the second dose in February. As treatment for the events, the patient was taking ibuprofen (MOTRIN), had taken paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH) at 1000 mg every 6 hours, and ibuprofen (ADVIL) at 400 mg. The patient had not recovered from the events. The patient considered that the events had a causality with the suspect product.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

I had the temp (not much as I take Tylenol for arthritis tid) and fatigue but my other symptoms were gastrointestinal. Epigastric distention, abdominal pain and nausea. It was over in approx. 12 hours. I had similar but more severe symptoms last April that I thought were food poisoning. Now I wonder if they were COVID-19 related.

An 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 21Jan2021 08:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included lymphoma from 2018. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer. The patient previously took rituxan for lymphoma (Reported she had been in remission for a little over a year. She said she had received only 4 Rituxan infusions for the lymphoma before she went into remission). 12 hours post injection: she &#34;experienced significant rigors and shaking, muscle and joint aches, her equilibrium was off at some point, she was tired, had generalized pain, and chills&#34;. She also confirmed feeling better.  She stated she heard the the second dose of the vaccine caused more reaction than the first dose and would like to validate the information. She explained the first instance she experienced rigors was after a lymphoma treatment. She believed the rigors lasted &#34;12 hours&#34; but was not certain because she &#34;fell asleep and got warmed&#34;. The patient felt great all day on 21Jan2021 after receiving her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said almost exactly 12 hours later, she started to have rigors. She was shaking so hard that her hands and body were jerking. Her muscles and joints were hurting, her equilibrium was off, she ached all over, she had pain, felt tired, and she had chills. The rigors started first. She said she felt really cold at the same time, so she went to bed and covered up, trying to get warmed. She fell asleep for awhile, and then woke up and went to the bathroom. When she went to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, she stood up, and every bone and muscle in her body hurt. She said she was aching all over, and her equilibrium was off. She didn&#39;t feel like getting up, and finally went to sleep to get the rigors to stop. She felt cold all the time now, but the rest of her symptoms had improved. She said it seemed like the muscle in her right leg was still pretty sore. She said she recovered from the rigors completely. She had rigors once before when she had an infusion. She clarified the infusion was Rituxan. She said she had a reaction to her first treatment of Rituxan. She said she had rigors when the Rituxan infusion was first started. She was given a couple things (but she didn&#39;t know what those things were), and she stopped shaking. She said the infusion staff waited a few minutes and tried to restart the Rituxan infusion, but she would have rigors again. She said the infusion staff tried slowing down the Rituxan infusion rate, as well. She said the Rituxan infusion normally takes 2 hours, but after 8 hours, she had only got about 20% of the Rituxan infusion, before the Rituxan infusion was stopped. She stated she had 3 subsequent Rituxan infusions at later dates, and did not have any problems with those infusions. Her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine was administered high up in the muscle of her left arm, close to the shoulder joint. She said the COVID- 19 Vaccine injection didn&#39;t hurt, and her left arm never got sore. She said on 30Dec2020 she had lab work done for her oncologist. She went about every other month for blood work to make sure she was still in remission. She saw her oncologist on 06Jan2021, and her oncologist said her blood work looked pretty good and was better. She asked her oncologist about the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her oncologist said she definitely wanted her to get the COVID-19 Vaccine. Her next appointment with her oncologist was in Mar2021. She said she had been seeing her oncologist every month, but her oncologist this time, wanted to try seeing her after 2 months. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of events rigors, shaking was recovered in Jan2021. The outcome of events muscle and joint aches/her muscles hurt, equilibrium was off, aching all over, tired, bone and muscle in her body hurt, hands and body were jerking was recovering. The outcome of event feels cold was not recovered.

                                                Developed blisters/rash on left buttock on Jan 31, 2021. I also felt extremely fatigued and had chills. I went to an appointment with a gynecologist for an unrelated chronic issue . (inflamed hemorrhoids) She examined my rash at that time and diagnosed it as shingles. Since that appointment the blisters began drying up. I continue to have itching, burning, and nerve pain on my left buttock.

An 81-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9261, Expiry date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at Single Dose (dose unknown; by injection once to left upper arm) for covid-19 immunisation, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.75 mg once a day, and orally from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at 0.88 mg, once a day for thyroid disorder.  Medical history included cancer, heart stents, irregular high blood pressure, breathing problem, underactive thyroid, back problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient took a flu shot 20 years ago for immunization and got really sick, took Pneumonia shots for immunization and was fine.  On 19Jan2021, the patient had a little lazy and tired. On 21Jan2021, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off; beating so fast and rapid it, and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head; on 21Jan2021, her body was shaking. In Jan2021, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath; she had SVG, she thought, it was irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart. Details were as follows: On 22Jan2021, she woke up in the morning around 3-4 am and said &#34;my heart was beating out of my chest and my head and ears closed down.&#34; The sensation subsided by 8 am. She called her family MD who did not respond so the following Monday she was in contact with her cardiologist who put her on a Holter monitor for a few days. He later told her she had SVT and prescribed a beta blocker for her to take. The patient stated &#34;I am so allergic to medicine.&#34; She took Plavix after a stent 5 years ago and was fine taking it for a few years. Then she had another stent placed, was prescribed Plavix again, and was &#34;so sick and dizzy and short of breath - it was the Plavix.&#34; States that she can take Cipro, ibuprofen, and synthroid and that her list of allergies is about &#34;2 pages long.&#34;  The patient wanted to know if she should take the second dose? her cardiologist advised that she not take it. Caller states she doesn&#39;t want to take the second dose and probably won&#39;t. She had a long history of allergic reactions to medications. She never had the flu, she hasn&#39;t had mumps, chicken pox, measles, occasionally, rarely a cold, about 20 years ago, she took a flu vaccine and got so sick after the shot and never took it again, she never got the flu, she does take Pneumonia shots and was fine. States she seems to have a natural immunity against typical disease you can catch. Other things, she had cancer, heart stents, and things of that sort, as far as infectious diseases, she had no problems. She had a reaction she thinks came from the COVID shot. She had a blood test and it showed her thyroid went a bit more underactive, so about 2 weeks ago, her Synthroid was raised from 0.75mg to 0.88mg, so 0.88mg was a new medication, but it was minimal. Communication: Caller was advised to slow down to assure accurate documentation. Synthroid 0.75mg: no NDC, lot, expiry. States this has been her only change in meds recently. She got that Synthroid the same day as she got her COVID vaccination, which was 19Jan2021, that afternoon, she got a Pfizer COVID vaccination. Also she got a prescription for her new Synthroid. The first day, 19Jan2012, she had no reaction at all, she took two Tylenol, someone suggested. She felt a little lazy and tired, for the rest of Tuesday, then Wednesday she felt more tired, she laid around on the couch watching TV, she stayed in her pajamas, had no serious reaction, just tired, then Tuesday and Wednesday, and then on Thursday night, she never did anything on Thursday either, she went to grocery store, was not feeling better, and on Thursday, 21Jan2021, at 3AM, she was awakened from sleeping, she did not sleep all night long, she got up often, her heart, she never had this before and had 3 stents, her heart was beating out of her chest, like she had a drum going off, it was beating so fast and rapid and her head felt closed off and ears- she could feel heartbeats in her head, and this went on, she didn&#39;t want to call, she lives by herself on a farm, and thought to wait and see if it goes away, and about 7AM, it was basically really bad from 3AM to 5AM, and at 7AM it went away, the rapid heartbeat was so far throughout and her body was shaking, and chest was so she never had it happen before.  At 8AM she called her family doctor office, she wanted to go and see them and she was told she wasn&#39;t in that day, they would send a note in the computer to get back with her. The doctor did not get back with her all day Friday, and then she felt ok Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, she had a couple tinge-y pains in her heart and shortness of breath, but her heart didn&#39;t feel like it was beating out of rhythm. Then Monday morning she called her heart doctor, he said he doesn&#39;t know, it doesn&#39;t sound to him like it was the Synthroid, since it was a small change of dose, but he didn&#39;t know about COVID but he hadn&#39;t heard it as being an after effect, but he said to come by 2:30PM on Monday, to be fitted with a heart monitor, which she wears on her heart and it listens 24/7, listens to her heart function, so she wore that, he said to bring it back on Monday and leave it in the office, and she did that, she wore it Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, she never had that really huge feeling in her in heart anymore, she thought it was a waste of time, then she got a call from the heart doctor on Tuesday, he asked how she was feeling, she said she was fine, and sorry if she caused a commotion and he said she has a heart problem now, she said she didn&#39;t feel anything, but her heart is beating erratically, and he doesn&#39;t know why she didn&#39;t feel it, he said she has SVG, she thinks, it is irregular heartbeats coming from the top of her heart and he says he will send in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a beta blocker, she thinks Metoprolol. The pharmacy just got the medicine in and she is sitting there waiting now. He told her a couple months ago, her heart sounds fine, there seemed to be nothing the matter. She asked if it was the COVID vaccine, he said he doesn&#39;t know, and she asked if she should take the second dose on 09Feb2021, he said no, he doesn&#39;t think he wants her to take it, she is going to see him in 2 weeks and will try the medicine, but she wanted to report what happened to her. Has Pfizer heard of anyone having rapid heartbeat after COVID vaccination. States she is overweight. Second dose is scheduled for 09Feb2021, at 1PM. Caller states going from 0.75mg to 0.88mg on Synthroid is a minimal adjustment, it can go up to the 200&#39;s for underactive thyroid, it&#39;s minimum, she is supposed to take it on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning with water. She has had underactive thyroid since she was 20 years old, so for 40 years, and had no problems with Synthroid before. The patient had irregular high blood pressure: it is high during the night and normal during the day, and if she would take, she had been going to physical therapy, she had a back problem, it came from a different thing, her knee is bone on bone, and they want her to get a knee implant, but when she limps on her knee it makes her back, it hurts from not walking straight, so she went to physical therapy, and what was causing high blood pressure, if she took Ibuprofen or Aleve, it would significantly increase her blood pressure, so she has a sensitivity to pain medicine, especially Ibuprofen and Advil, it increases her blood pressure, and often when she doesn&#39;t have it in her system, her blood pressure is much more normal. She does not have Ibuprofen, Aleve, Advil to provide lot/expiry, she is in her car. She is interested, she feels she won&#39;t take the second vaccine, she wants to see what they say, she also wants to ask how much protection with just the first shot?  The action taken in response to the event for levothyroxine sodium was unknown. The outcome of the events heart was &#39;beating out of chest&#39;, &#39;head and ears closed down&#39; was recovered in Jan2021, of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number:  EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm  on 23Jan2021at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease; scalp issue; abrasions on her head like eczema; and weight loss. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with Hashimoto. A thyroid disorder. She is not on a thyroid medication. They have just been watching it to see. She took the shot. For background, the last couple of months the patient has had abrasions on her head like eczema. She has been going to the Dermatologist for the last year. They have been trying to figure out what is going on. Concomitant medications included Phentermine for weight loss. The patient took the shot on a Saturday 23Jan2021. She did fine Sunday, but by Sunday evening on 24Jan2021, she was feeling bad. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site really red, hard and warm but didn&#39;t hurt; head broken out so bad; and joint pain. On 25Jan2021, the patient felt very dizzy/ light headed, fatigue and lethargic. As the evening went on for two to three days later from the vaccination, she experienced side effects. She got up in the middle of the night that night, and her head was broken out so bad that she couldn&#39;t comb her hair. There were least 100-150 small little bumps on her head. They almost feel like they have oil under them. They were sore and very irritated. Her scalp was blood red with inflammation. This has went on the course of 8-9 days. She also had joint pain really bad. Almost like a flare up of Hashimoto. She hasn&#39;t been having issues with it. It was like her skin was on fire. Even regular water in the shower feels like it was burning. It felt like some kind of nerve ending issue. She was also very off balance, and light headed. She never ran a fever. She was so exhausted that she couldn&#39;t get out of bed for the last 8 days. She is scheduled for the second shot.  She is scheduled for the second dose 16Feb2021.  Her doctor told her to go ahead and get the other shot, but she would like more information. She did not have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine at a a local hospital where she goes for testing. She could never get through to get ahold of the hospital so she tried to go through another facility. She finally got an appointment through the hospital. She was wondering if it is okay to get the second shot. She has had a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is. They have tried to treat it with a steroid. She has seen several who don&#39;t have a clue what is could be. Whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse. The joint pain was almost 100 % better since yesterday. It was mostly in her feet and knees. She was very dizzy and light headed. She wasn&#39;t falling all over the place or anything. That has improved over the last day or two. The first night, she got up to go to the bathroom, and she lost her balance but caught self. she was very careful from then on. She has fatigue as well. She still has a little weakness since the 25Jan2021. She never lost her appetite, but she felt very lethargic since the 25Jan2021. She has recovered from most of these issues, except for her head. She is in very good health except for her thyroid issue. That she has been diagnosed with for a couple of years, and the stuff in her hair. They don&#39;t know what has caused that. Every test has been negative. She thought at one point it could be the medication she was on. She was taking Phentermine to lose weight. She was wondering if it would have any recourse, but her doctor said no. She quit taking it the day before the shot just in case. She hadn&#39;t taken it again until today. The dose is 37.5mg. The way she felt at first, she felt like she had COVID. The patient stated, &#34;I had some reaction to the (first) Pfizer covid 19 shot I took on 23Jan2021 wanted to ask if I would be able to take the 2nd shot. I took the shot fine, got home. The injection site was red, hard, kind of warm. My arm was never sore but the day after into Sunday I felt very washed out and thought I was tired. I have a thyroid issue, I&#39;ve been having a scalp problem and this sometimes come with my thyroid issue. Little bumps in my scalp, they were kind of under control because of the Clobetasol propriate foam that I put in my hair and ever since then my skin is on fire. But the main thing I was exhausted, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands. I laid around and for 5-6 days and today is the first real good day. I still have the bumps but I&#39;m seeing a different dermatologist. I have an over active immune system Hashimoto&#39;s disease and something can set up a flare.&#34; The outcome of the events almost like a flare up of hashimoto and a scalp problem, but nobody knows what it is/ whatever she has, the vaccine aggravated it 10 times worse was not recovered; events she was feeling bad, joint pain, knees, feet, even my hands, very dizzy/ light headed, i felt very washed out and thought i was tired/ exhausted, lethargic and she still has a little weakness was recovering; events the injection site was red, hard, kind of warm was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of the other events was unknown.

It is better but not completely gone yet. The sneezing is not constant, as of today but still there.

Asking for information on muscle and joint pain after the vaccine and recommendations on what to do. So far she didn&#39;t know what it was, and if it was a side effect of the arthritis, because once in a while that happens but when it happened it went away right away but this time her wrist pain was there still there. Patient sat down and now she was stretching her leg, she sat down on the chair and its gone she had no more problems. Patient said her right hand, she was very slow writing.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

I then had painful cramping in my left calf and then the entire leg which then followed by Muscle pain and cramping in both legs.  I was told that I should exercise, so I went for a long walk.  When I returned home, i felt even worse so I went back to bed. Headaches began. I had flu-like symptoms (chills and discomfort) I covered my self with two blankets and drank lots of water and took an Aleve.which upset my stomach.  3/03 (the next morning), my usual sinus stuffiness was Gone! and I could breathe better than i have in a long time (by days end my sinusitis had returned) and so had my headache. Today 3/04 I still feel exhausted and I have swelling, puffs under my eyes (not usual) and occasional headaches.  My Left Arm (area of the inoculation) Has Never Been Painful!!!!!!

Medical history included seasonal asthma, allergy to class A antihistamines that started in her 20s, facial &amp; peripheral edema, blood pressure abnormal, and celiac disease. The patient had known allergy to Benadryl and when she takes it she gets peripheral and facial edema, lip swelling, top and bottom, hives around her whole right eye. The patient also has an allergy to Class A antihistamines that started in her 20s. She said the allergy started with Seldane &amp; Claritin. She said she had giant hives with Claritin. She said she was told there were 2 classes of antihistamines &amp; she couldn&#39;t use the Class A antihistamines. She said she previously reported her Seldane, Claritin &amp; Benadryl allergies, saying she has facial &amp; peripheral edema. She said she only uses the Class B antihistamine Cimetidine now. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, omeprazole, and pravastatin. On an unspecified date, the patient was experiencing an allergic reaction, rash. On 21Feb2021, the patient experienced &#34;her upper lip became puffy/bottom lip began to swell,&#34; multiple hives all around her right eye, wheezing, and didn&#39;t feel comfortable. On 21Feb2021 at 14:00 (reported as about 2PM), the patient experienced &#34;Itching eyes/My eyes started itching.&#34; On 21Feb2021 at 21:00 (reported as 9PM), the patient experienced little coughing spell. The reporter considered the events swelling lips, itching eyes, multiple hives all around her right eye, and wheezing as serious medically significant. The patient further reported that she felt fine after the shot, her arm was not sore, nothing. She said her arm was fine, and she had no problems, whatsoever, after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has had some weird allergic reactions in the past, but no anaphylaxis. About 12:00 to 12:30 PM (also reported as around midday), the patient&#39;s lip felt puffy. She said she had ate an apple and thought maybe something was on the skin of the apple. She said then her bottom lip began to swell, so she took 3 Cimetidine (NDC Number: 49035-820-72, lot number: 9AE2576A, expiry date: Dec2020). The patient stated that she was allergic to what she believe are class A antihistamines as they gave her facial and peripheral edema including Benadryl and everything on the list. About 2PM, the patient&#39;s eyes felt itchy, she took allergy eye drops (eye drops seasonal relief with tetrahydrozoline HCL 0.05% and zinc sulfate 0.25%. She said the product packaging reads it soothes eyes, and she said the eye drops worked. Lot number: AC8K275, expiration date: Sep2021). She said when she looked in the mirror, she saw a large hive on her eye (clarified as multiple hives all around her right eye). And about 4PM, she realized that her lips felt puffy, so she repeated the Cimetidine, it kept them from getting worse. At 7PM, her eye felt worse. She had this real hive that surrounded her right eye, she took a picture so she could report it to the doctor. The patient have an appointment on Wednesday. At 7:30PM, the patient&#39;s lips were puffy, she repeated the Cimetidine again and took of the 200 mg, she takes 3 at a time, she mentioned she could take 4, but she takes 3. She said she took more Cimetidine at 8:30PM, and talked to a pharmacist, who told her to call Pfizer to report her reaction. She said she attempted to call Pfizer last night, but it was too late, clarifying Pfizer Medical Information was already closed for the day. The patient also reported that she had a little coughing spell at about 9PM, so she stayed up with her husband till 10PM because she didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The patient told her husband to wake her up every once in a while. The patient felt a little wheezy, she used both of her inhalers, she could hear the wheezing, she used the serevent diskus (Serevent Diskus 50 mcg Inhaler. She said she has been using the Serevent Diskus Inhaler for seasonal allergies for years and the inhaler works. She said she occasionally uses the Serevent Diskus for colds during the winter. She said she realized she was wheezing last night and thought she should use the Serevent Diskus. NDC Number: 0173-0521-00, Lot Number: VV3E, Expiration Date: Sep2021) and Flovent (Flovent HFA 110mcg Inhaler, NDC Number: 0170719-20, Lot Number: C47A, Expiration Date: Jul2021). That seemed to be okay, she went to bed, and had a good night no problems. She said she woke up this morning and felt better. She said she sounds a little gunky this morning, clarifying that was somewhat typical for her. The patient further reported that she got up at 6:30AM, she took a shower, she was having a rebound reaction, and wheezing, so she took 3 more Cimetidine and repeated the inhalers. She clarified while her symptoms worsened after the hot shower this morning, her symptoms are much less than yesterday (21Feb2021), saying she was aware of her symptoms today, and paying attention to them. She said her lips became puffy, and she was wheezy after the hot shower. She said she took Cimetidine and her inhalers again this morning to treat the rebound reaction. She decided to repeat again at about quarter to 10AM, she repeated again trying to keep it under control. In the meantime, she spoke to her doctors office, and they just said keep doing what she&#39;s doing, and if she get real bad, call 911 or go to emergency room (ER). The patient have an appointment, the patient&#39;s big concern was that she probably shouldn&#39;t get the second COVID shot. She read on (website), that there was a very rare, mild anaphylactic reactions. What caught her eye was that this takes place about 4 hours after the dose. This was when her symptoms began, lucky her. Her whole life has been allergy related. The patient don&#39;t know if celiac disease has anything with this. The patient wanted to know whether or not there was some way to take the shot without killing herself. She said she was not having breathing difficulty, she was just wheezy. She said she repeated the Cimetidine about a half hour before she called Pfizer today. She said she called her doctor&#39;s office this morning, and her doctor said for her to keep treating her symptoms as she had been doing. She said her doctor told her to call an ambulance or go to the emergency room if her symptoms happen to get worse. She said she read online that skin anaphylaxis (hives, itching, and swelling of the eyes, face, lips and throat) can occur with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she read the information about the COVID-19 Vaccine at (Website name). She said she read skin anaphylaxis was extremely rare and less than 1% of the population has the allergy, and those individuals should not get the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was upset because what she read probably means she can&#39;t get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said she read the skin anaphylaxis appears within 4 hours after getting vaccinated with the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her symptoms occurred in almost the same amount of time as to what she read about a skin anaphylaxis reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she has a regular check-up on Wednesday (24Feb2021) with her doctor, and will speak further to her doctor about getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine.

Day after, Saturday, itching intensified, throat tightened (muscular feeling); and tongue began to become sore, and began to show redness on sides.  Bad enough that I finally took a 4-6 hour dose of Benadryl, and slept afternoon.  Felt better when I woke up but when effects of Benadryl wore off, the tongue swelling intensified and frightened me.  Decided against emergency call on weekend and took Benadryl (4-6 hour) about 8 or 9 Pm and next morning (about 5 or 6AM) noted that I felt okay and tongue had become pink not red though still some swelling on the sides of tongue.  Had no strong adverse effects after first dose, some chills in the evening and arm swelling/pain  that resolved by 3AM.

Often trembly with complete lack of appetite (lost 6 pound in 2 weeks). Only wanted to sit or lie down- unable to  go for daily walk (no strength).  No fever or respiratory symptoms.  This extreme condition lasted for approx. 10 weeks, during which time I saw my doctors five times for diagnosis or assistance.  They could find no reason for my sudden symptoms except for adverse reaction to the vaccine, and were unable to assist.  I mostly sat and laid around  for 10/11 weeks , after which my symptoms improved gradually, and I  am feeling better at this time.

A 81-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9262 and expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 17Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot: Lot 1283) on 27Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included immune system disorder. Concomitant medications included promethazine (PHENERGAN) and loratadine (IMMUNIX). It was reported that patient experienced the headache a couple days after second dose.

The patient feels nauseous and sick still and still has a headache. It was reported that the patient called the doctor wanting a refill on her Phenergan, but the doctor told her no and said that she has to call Pfizer. It was reported that she doesn&#39;t understand why the doctor would say that when he knows Pfizer has nothing to do with her receiving her Phenergan. It was stated that he doesn&#39;t understand, this is not a new medication for her, she&#39;s just getting a refill for something that she&#39;s had before. The doctor said that they couldn&#39;t do anything. Outcome of puking was reported as recovered and outcome of tired, then had chills, her temperature was going up and down many times, the most it went to was 100.5F then went to normal and nauseous was reported as unknown.

                                                After the first vaccine she experienced pain in arm and pain between the eyes. She also had flu like symptoms for approximately 3 days, and unusual bowel movements not diarrhea, not constipated, but not normal and painful.  After second dose had similar reaction bowel issues are still bad and very painful (to the point of vomiting during bowel movements  due to pain). She saw her primary care doctor and was Rx&#39;d a cream.  This has caused her to decrease her eating.  This did not help and she was having loss of visual acuity and started not being able to speak properly so went to the ED  for concern over Strokes.     had 2 MRIs, and determined not to be having a stroke so was released to home.  Sxs seemed to resolve ( like a spell) .   Was still having bowel issues and she also developed a rash from the neck to the groin. So she went to a specialist.   The Rash cleared after about 3 days.   Specialist advised that the sxs were all due to the COVID Vaccine.  Flank pain under the right ribs has also been present, this is not improving,  it is a dull pain that seems to be worsening  ( the bowel seems to be about back to normal now) She is planning on speaking with her PCP about the right flank pain.

                                                She got the vaccine, and had no reactions at all other than perhaps a chill.  About  2-3 weeks later on 3/7/21 she started experiencing what they are calling muscle confusions.  She feels a tapping sensation on her biceps and triceps and then starts with muscle cramps running down her right arm creating her fingers to cringe or come together or contract.  This then travels down to her right leg to her quadriceps which cramps and convulse and travels to her calves which tighten up like a Charlie Horse and down her toes to where they contract as well.  They are intermittent, scattered and sporadic.  Sometimes she will get 2-3 a day, and then none at all and then a few days later a couple more.   These contractions last 3-5 minutes.  She had COVID back in April of 2020 and was hospitalized until August of 2020 with that.  During that time she was on a ventilator for 60 days and on a breathing tube and coded and was out for about 30 minutes.  She had an EEG of her brain in September and told that she was fine.  her neurologist felt she should have another one due to these symptoms, and she had that and everything was normal.  The doctor prescribed 500 mg twice a day of Levetiracetam.   The seizures kind of regress a little and then they came back and he upped that medication to 1000 mg twice a day.  The seizures still continue and have continued but is still taking the medication.  He felt that she should know see an epileptic specialist and they have an APT for 5/27/21.   These episodes are exhausting and wear her out.   She was going to PT due to the weakness from being in the hospital for so long, and now she is fearful if she is going to fall and uses a walker and is having a setback in that progress.  She is to continue therapy at home for now and to follow up with the Epilepsy specialist.

                                                A whole-body rash was evident 2-3 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Subject was unsure at the time if it was vaccine related. Severe swelling of hands and legs began the same day after the second vaccine dose with general malaise and concerns about fainting. Oral steroids were prescribed for 2 weeks, and progression of the symptoms seem to stabilize during steroid treatment. After steroid treatment, the symptoms resumed at full strength with swelling in the hands and legs causing the superficial skin to peel off and split down into the dermis with bleeding and pain. Joints in the hands and legs were painful. Severe swelling and pain in the hands and legs persisted for at least 6 weeks after the second vaccine dose. A diuretic was prescribed at about 4-5 weeks after the second vaccine dose. The subject is currently reporting improved symptoms.

An 81-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (fairly early in the day) (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE for covid-19 immunization, at the age at vaccination of 81 years old.  Anatomical Location of Administration of Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect: She did not really remember but she tends to think it was in her right arm for both. Medical history included tachycardia (This all started when she was 43 years old, and usually gets them periodically; benign with a regular rhythm), ongoing panic attack had for 40 years, ongoing anxiety (reported as she was an anxious person and at first she thought that it was just her anxiety kicking in but the event was beyond anything in 40 years that she has ever experienced). Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6200) for covid-19 immunization and experienced tired a little bit. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced 2nd dose- went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years (hospitalization) on 17Mar2021 with outcome of recovered on unknown date, accompanied with a panic attack (hospitalization) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, 2nd dose- extremely exhausted (non-serious) on 15Mar2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Mar2021, trauma (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Reported as she got her second dose on 15Mar2021 and both her husband and her were extremely exhausted, not sleepy, just tired. They were told to expect that though. There was no pain or nothing at the injection site for her. Then 2 days later she went into a tachycardia event that was beyond anything she has ever had in the past 40 years. She knew how to take care of these events and they are usually accompanied with a panic attack and she can usually calm it with breathing. But this was extreme, it was beyond anything in the past 40 years that she has ever experienced. Her husband took her to the hospital and they checked her out and she was okay and her heart did calm down. But what was interesting was that ever since that event on 15Mar2021 she had not had 1 panic attack or one tachycardia episode. She had a slight one not to long ago but it was not like the ones that she used to get. She used to get these events fairly often in a short period of time. She is not sure if the COVID vaccine did anything, but she was grateful if it did but she just wanted to make that comment about the good. 2nd dose- She was extremely exhausted and this began soon after she had the COVID vaccine fairly early in the day. Her and her husband came home soon afterwards and looked at each other and said that they were tired and it was not sleepiness, it was not like they needed a nap. It was profound tiredness and exhaustion. Her husband had it more so but they were both in bed for a couple hours. Neither had pain in the injection site though. This lasted for several hours into the evening. 2nd dose- Her tachycardia event was on 17Mar2021 which was two days after her COVID vaccine. Her husband took her to the emergency room in the early evening that day and when she got there the event was still occurring but it was not as severe. She was in the emergency room for a couple of hours, so late that night she was released and when she went home she was tired. Which she usually is tired after her tachycardia events occur. But while in the emergency room everything checked out. She confirms that she has recovered completely. She was curious if anyone else has reported anything with this same kind of thing she has experienced. She is amazed because she has had lots of trauma in the last week with her grandson and normally an event like that would have her over the top but she has been calm about it. He was 21 years old and he attempted suicide and she cannot believe it. He was out of state and she was so close to him. At the very last moment he told his dad that he is making a mistake and he just can not stand the isolation from college. This normally would send her into the worst but she has been very calm and maybe it just has not all hit her yet and then also the recent events with her husband would normally make her very frightened. She is glad that she has not had any tachycardia events but this all started when she was 43 years old and she usually gets them periodically. She declined a transfer since it is lunch time and she needs to wake her husband for his lunch. She remembered reading articles while she was waiting for her first dose and tachycardia jumped out at her as a side effect and her husband first thought was that seeing that triggered her but she didn&#39;t have anything after the first dose so she dismissed it but then it occurred after her second dose. She was more amazed that she has not had an attack since then and she has not had any tachycardia and she has had them for years and she is just so grateful. The events require a visit to Emergency Room. Not to Physician Office: not really because she did it on her own and then she got in contact with her doctors.

An 81-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 81-year-old in Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included bladder cancer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Caller states &#39;&#39;My sister and I both received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. My sister developed Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration two weeks after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. They did find a half cm tumor in her fallopian tube. Her doctors have reported the side effect but at that time she was not fully diagnosed. They thought at that time it was meningitis .&#39;&#39; Caller wants to know if Meningitis or Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration has been associated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Response: Spoke from the attached document. These two disorders have not been listed as side effects associated with the vaccine. However we may not have the list of all the possible side effects associated with the vaccine. Caller was reporting side effects for her sister related to the Covid 19 vaccine. Her sister had received the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine and 2 weeks later developed a disorder called Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. They had found a tumor in the fallopian tube that was a tiny half centimeter tumor. Said that the doctors had reported the side effects but at the time it was not yet diagnosed as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. At the time, they thought she had meningitis. The event happened about 2 weeks after the vaccine, so about 11Feb2021, was about 2 weeks before or 2 and a half weeks before 11Feb2021 that she got the vaccine. She was in the hospital 10 and a half weeks (about for 74 days). She contacted Pfizer, she believes in Mar2021. Since Feb2021 she had been in 3 different hospitals. They did send her some paperwork but she has not completed it yet. At that point in Mar2021 her diagnosis was meningitis. As it later turns out, it turned to a new diagnosis of the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Her sister lives in PRIVACY, she does not even know where she went for the vaccine. She hasn&#39;t filed the written report yet. She was not diagnosed with the Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration until the very end, 10 days before she died. She died on 24Apr2021. Cause of death: They had removed her ovaries and fallopian tubes had the suspicion that this might have been the diagnosis without ever seeing the tumor. She had multiple CT scans (2021) and never saw the tumor until they removed the fallopian tubes. They found a 1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes which is what the cause of death was. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. The caller is terrified to get the vaccine, since she had bladder cancer. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. They did not do an autopsy, probably because that was up to her brother in law and can understand why an autopsy was not done. They also say when her sister was having all of these bizarre symptoms, it was an auto immune reaction. She was perfectly fine and had come home from a bird watch. She had severe headache, eyes would move back and forth involuntarily in 2021. That never went away. She had severe vertigo in 2021, and it all happened in one day, it didn&#39;t go away. They did an immunoglobulin infusion treatment, she had very good treatment. They put her on steroids. The immunoglobulin treatment was for five days and nothing touched those symptoms. They had moved her from one hospital to a rehab facility in PRIVACY. The rehab doctor reported all of these symptoms to Pfizer. At that time, they were still calling it meningitis. He said that the elephant in the room was the vaccine. Felt the vaccine is not totally what caused it but accelerated what ever was going on with her, these bizarre disorders. Maybe this would have happened without the vaccine. They will never know. She wishes that someone can tell her whether or not she should get the vaccine. She asked her doctor who said he was not going to tell her to not get the vaccine. She was calling to see if this has happened to anyone else. They say the tumor was the cause because it would have been so odd that it came on so suddenly, 2 weeks after the vaccine. She had asked if anyone had reported this because that was the diagnosis at the time. The patient was hospitalized for events for 74 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The patient died on 24Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  The outcome of event half cm tumor in her fallopian tube/1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes was fatal. The outcome of events Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration and meningitis was unknown. The outcome of other events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: half cm tumor in her fallopian tube/1.5cm tumor in the fallopian tubes

Woke up Thursday morning and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  I was dizzy and nauseous.  I got up 3 times to use the bathroom and couldn&#39;t even swallow water until 9:30 PM.  I had 1/2 cup soup and water that evening.  Thursday I was only slightly dizzy but was able to eat and drink.  I didn&#39;t feel well enough to leave my house until Sunday.  Today is a week since the second dose and I&#39;m almost back to normal, but still tired.  FYI, I did have COVID last March.  I was quite sick but not hospitalized.  I received phone calls every other day from the DOH during the almost 3 weeks I was in isolation at home.  I gave plasma 3 times after recovering.

The shaking originated at the injection site in right deltoid and radiated in shooting sensation down her right arm. Her entire body was shaking. She describes feeling &#34;like I got the shakes and I couldn&#39;t control it.&#34; Felt like she needed to urinate (uses catheter) but no urine passed. Was unable to speak. Adult daughter was present. Event lasted approximately 30 minutes before gradually stopping. Took her temperature afterward and it was 99F.  Slept very deeply that night, which is unusual for her.

Attempted to vomit but only gaged.  Friend called at 700am and I wasn&#39;t making much sense.  Later in the day I seemed alright, became cold in the evening and fever had returned.  At 4 am morning of 2/17 I woke up soaking wet.  Went back to sleep and seemed to be fine when I got up at 8am.  It is now 2 weeks since I had this shot and I have experienced no further problems.  My daughter-in-law Is a doctor and she said I should report these side effects.

On 1/12/21  I received a call from the nursing home that my mom had stopped eating and drinking and that she had nothing to eat or drink for 3 days. I asked them why they didn&#39;t call me sooner but they did not have an answer. I was told to come in because she was very lethargic and possible dehydrated.  They tested her for Covid the morning of 1/12/21 and she tested negative.  I went into see my mom and she was barely conscious.  They gave her fluids intravenously but it had no positive affect on her condition.  On 1/14/21 she tested positive for covid and was moved to their covid unit.  I called in Hospice comfort care on 1/15/21.  My. mom died on 1/17/21.

Medical history included anticoagulant therapy , bone disorder, vitamin D deficiency (vitamin supplementation), probiotic therapy, rhinorrhoea, lung congestion, dry eye .

The patient took Tylenol for her  headache. The patient stated that states her injection site was already black and blue when she got home and removed the bandage. Adds in her photo her whole shoulder is yellow and it looks jaundiced.  The nurse stated that the incident occurred on Friday 29Jan2021 , so they had multiple different type of syringes and needles that was using to administered and they had a vaccinator who was using a lower lock syringe in which you case you know you have to secure the needle by twisting in to that lower lock and when he went to administer the vaccine to the patient two drops of medication leak down her arm, so of course we are at that point the vaccinator realize the lower lock and that the needle had not been completely secured so we don&#39;t know how much vaccine the patient actually received.  Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.

Medical history included neuroendocrine tumour of the lung and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Diagnosed 15 or so years ago). There were no concomitant medications. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available): N/A.

These symptoms felt important enough to report, she doesn&#39;t know if Pfizer is keeping track of it or what. When probed for consent to contact, the caller explains the doctor she had been seeing is no longer practicing, and she just started seeing this doctor. She doesn&#39;t know how much this new doctor is going to help. Caller adds that she also experienced diarrhea. She was a little bit better yesterday, but she feels fine today. She states she maybe a little tired today, but nothing else. She is fine. Her daughter had a question that she wanted the caller to ask. These symptoms do not mean she should not get the second shot? These are pretty normal side effects, aren&#39;t they? From what she has read they are. She is scheduled for her second vaccine on 26Feb2021. Vaccination Facility Type: there is a special area roped off just giving shots to public. The outcome of events was recovered on 08Feb2021 and for event (tired) was unknown.

                                                Got her vaccine, came home drove herself, had no problem whatsoever, felt perfectly fine during the day.  She then went out, got lunch, brought it home, nothing about the day was out of the ordinary other than the vaccination.  She often stays up too late and watches TV in her recliner and falls asleep.  She guesses she didn&#39;t put things away properly, and the next thing that she remembers was going into the bathroom to get ready for bed, extremely cold evening.  She then remembers when she went to hang up fuzzy robe up in the bathroom on a hanger on the doorway, and when she reached up just at that moment she felt herself falling/passing out.  She does not remember the moments before or after the event.  She fell over her bathtub that was in the doorway, and remembers the pain of hitting the tub.  The next thing she remembers is like she was in a dream, and remembers thinking that she had to call her son as she knew she was in trouble.  She does not remember dialing his # at that point, but her memory tells her that she told him that she needed him.  She was told that was her 2nd call and she does not remember that.  She remembers thinking at some point that she was coming in and out of consciousness, and remembers her son didn&#39;t come.  She called 9-1-1 and remembers talking to somebody and telling them that she could not get up.  She answered that she had her door unlocked and remembers that, and apparently told them that she could not stand up.  She remembers crawling, possibly to the front door to unlock it.  She also remembers telling the 9-1-1 person to tell the sirens off when they get to the neighborhood.  They came and took her to the hospital, but doesn&#39;t remember that but then suddenly felt like she was freezing, and asking for a blanket, and asked if somebody opened a door.  She does not remember the ride to the hospital, going out of her house, just being so cold she was hurting.  She doesn&#39;t remember anything whatsoever of being in the ER, running tests.  They apparently did 2 CAT scans and 2 MRI&#39;s, with and without contrast on both.  The ER report said that when they got her that she was having extreme chills, and in a stroke-like condition, she could not see and she could not move her body.  No tests indicated that she had a stroke.  She doesn&#39;t think any of them knew that she had the vaccine, they only knew she was a heart patient, and looking for the stroke by doing typical stroke tests.  She apparently had called her son first and told him that she was going crazy, and he called his sister, and then she called him again and said that she needed help, and didn&#39;t understand what she was talking about.  She had no temperature she was told when they took her to the hospital.  At some point she then started to spike her fever, which went up to 103.  The next clear memory she has is that she woke up on Sunday in the hospital in a pool of sweat after her fever had broken.  She also has a memory that she woke up and somebody was touching her in her privates, and there was somebody trying to catheterize her.  At first she didn&#39;t understand why and then had a vague memory of trying to get a bedpan under her, and decided to catheterize her.  She then back to sleep and woke up on Sunday and was completely waking up then and saw her son sitting there.  All memories other than this was vague and in and out.  After she was awake on Monday they came and did an EEG of her brain, it was normal.  She then was given speech therapy on Sunday afternoon, had 10 questions, and answered 9 of them, but on one of them she told them that she could not do that, and did it the next day again and was able to complete that test.     When she fell and hit the bathtub she did hurt her arm from her elbow to halfway toward her wrist.  Then they discharged her home with someone with her 24 hours a day and could not drive or use the stairs until she had been seen by her family doctor in a week or two to make that she was safe.  She had home health care coming in and PT had been coming as well.   She had home health still as of yesterday 3/25/21, and PT discharged her as of yesterday.    She has been by herself, and is OK to use the stairs and driving again.  She has one more home health nurse visit for them to sign off and say that she is now OK.    She did get her 2nd vaccine, and she had minor issues, a weird feeling in her head for 12 hours, but nothing bad enough to take something for it.  It was a little uncomfortable and out of the norm for about a day, and at one point the next afternoon was making a sandwich and had something that went through her body and felt like she was going to pass out and got into her recliner.  She laid down for about 15-20 minutes, it passed and she has been fine.   She had somebody stay with her for 24 hours and has done well since.    She is convinced that this reaction did come from the vaccine, and that the first vaccine can cause adverse reactions, and that she does live alone and never occurred to her that she needed somebody to stay with her, and now she is afraid to be alone.

An 82-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6200) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Mar2021 11:00 as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation, at 82 years old. Medical history included history of a stroke from an unknown date (previous history of a stroke 19 months ago). There were no concomitant medications.

The patient reported no reaction and no problems (no pain, no nausea, no anything) from the second dose until the evening of 08Mar2021 when she was in her kitchen cooking and chopping vegetables, she felt the sudden urge to faint and then became so dizzy that she had to lie down on the couch. She had an overwhelming feeling of dizziness. A feeling like she wanted to faint, and she never faints. Her daughter got her to the sofa. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. The room spun unbelievably. Everything spun. She went to bed and when she woke up, she felt worse. She states that the dizziness was worse, she was unable to visually focus, if she closed her eyes and she opened one eye it would be blurry and the people on TV were sliding off the screen and  everything was sliding away, and she had pain behind her left eye into her head. When she tried to get up to go to the bathroom the room was spinning. It lasted through the next day (09Mar2021). When she got up, she couldn&#39;t put her two feet on the floor out of bed without leaning towards the left. She didn&#39;t fall. It was so bad she had to grab onto things to walk.  During that day they brought her downstairs and she stayed on the sofa and it just got worse. Her daughter had her call her primary care doctor and he said that if her neurologist had heard any of what had happened, then go to the emergency room, to which is where she was 19 months ago with her stroke. She spent the 11Mar2021 and 12Mar2021 in hospital (due to dizziness). They couldn&#39;t find anything. She had not had a new stroke.  She had every test known to man. They did a full neurological work up including an MRI, CT Scan, carotid artery studies and checked everything and could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke. The told her that she could potentially have an inner ear problem or problems with the &#34;crystals in her ear&#34; which could be causing her dizziness, however, they could not positively identify the cause of her problem. They found evidence of her previous stoke. When they were sending her home, it says on her discharge paperwork, they were going to put her in a vestibular clinic. It has to do with crystals in her ear. She was still dizzy and still walking with a walker which she hasn&#39;t had to use in 19 months since her stroke. And she has slept a lot, the night she was discharged on 12Mar2021 and the following day. On 14Mar2021 she woke up a little bit. But on 15Mar2021, she is very tired and very weak and still very dizzy. The dizziness is not the room revolving kind. She is taking an anti dizzy pill. She has to see her doctor tomorrow morning, her neurologist at hospital. The dizziness is still persisting but not as bad and she can jump up and walk and do things with the walker. Regarding tests done at the hospital, she came out with shining colors apparently.  All tests came through fine. There was no evidence of stroke, her blood pressure, triglycerides, fluids or liquids, everything tested perfect. When querying if she had gone to her physician&#39;s office, she reported she had a morning call with her doctor on a phone appointment and he sent her straight to the hospital. She is still dizzy and walking with a walker which she has not had to use in 19 months. She states that doing a lot of hand-eye coordination exercises at home. She has the television on to check her vision which seems to be returning to normal. She stated, &#34;I just don&#39;t know where to go from here.&#34; She stated that she has a follow up appointment the following day with her neurologist. She wanted to know if this side effect has been reported and how long she can expect to feel this way.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on Mar2021 which included blood pressure, triglyceride, fluids or liquids: tested perfect; and CAT scan, EKG had unknown results. On 11Mar2021, CT Scan: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem); MRI: unknown results (could not find the cause of her extreme dizziness. They did confirm that she did not have a stroke/they could not positively identify the cause of her problem).

                                                COVID Vaccine  I got my #2 Pfizer last Tuesday Apr 6....no problem at all with #1.  The vaccination was in my LEFT arm, and the 1st day or so I didn&#39;t really have anything but tiredness.  But the last few days have been very painful.  I developed swelling on the RIGHT side of my face starting at the temple. That progressed down to the ear area the next few days and was quite painful.   Since Saturday  my tongue, lips, gums became swollen resulting in barely being able to swallow. Also rash developed and is getting worse.  Additionally I ache all over and feel like a very bad case of the flu.  I tried Tylenol Extra Strength in the beginning, but that seemed to only ease the pain for about an hour.  Now I&#39;m  using  Advil, which helps for several hours.  Is there anything I can do to get relief.  This is the 8th day....and it seems to be getting worse instead of better.

An 82-year-old male received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot/Batch number: Unknown, ExpirationDate: Unknown) on 30Mar2021 via unspecified route of administration at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 Immunization. The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated the next morning she could not open her mouth, could not chew, face was hot and puffy, might have some fever also. She took a couple of Aleve, and it went away after couple of days. The patient stated she didn&#39;t know for sure if it was related to the Covid-19 vaccine or not. The day that she got the Covid-19 vaccine, later provided as 30Mar2021, she felt fine and never had a sore arm or fever. It was reported that it was almost like lockjaw, that she couldn&#39;t brush her teeth or chew. The patient reported that later in the day, the side of her face was all hot and might have been swollen and she took ibuprofen and that the inability to open her mouth went away in a couple of days. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient reported that she went to the chiropractor a couple of days later and the chiropractor said that he had heard about patients experiencing lockjaw after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and she looked on Pfizer&#39;s website and the AE she experienced was not listed as a side effect. She is just a little concerned as she is scheduled to receive her second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine next week on 20Apr2021. She is afraid that the lockjaw might come back and might be worse. She is just curious if she is the only one that experienced the inability to open her mouth. The patient reported she does not know anyone that had this reaction and it is not listed as a side effect on Pfizer&#39;s website. The outcome of the event was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

Chest xray showed radiographic evidence of pneumonia in RLL but without evidence of acute PE on CT scan. Patient was requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations and so was placed on high flow nc with better response 4/23 remained on HFNC 4/24 BCx from 4.22.21 growing out gram positive cocci in 1/2 bottles 4/26 HFNC at 50% and 45L 4/27 off HFNC and on 6 L NC/ awaiting PT evaluation 4/28 per, OT assessment -- pt dropped into 70&#39;s on 6L 02 with short walk to bathroom and toileting tasks. cues for rest and PLB needed to increase 02 into 80s. with a seated rest break over 5 mins 02 increased to 88% on 6L  COVID pneumonia (first dose of Pfizer vaccine mid April) S/P remdesivir X 5 days, now on day 8/10 decadron but will go home on oral decadron  Acute hypoxic respiratory failure slowly improving (not on home oxygen therapy) now off HFNC, was on 10 L oxymask. Patient&#39;s pulse ox this morning at rest on 4 L was 86% but improved to 92% on 5 L NC -will need 5L home oxygen therapy at discharge (new) -discussed the need to follow up with Dr or PCP to wean off supplemental oxygen. Patient agreeable with this plan  Transaminitis levels trending downwards.    History of thymoma s/p VATS 2011 -outpatient follow up   Positive blood culture on admission, contaminant in 1 of 2 blood culture bottles. Repeat blood cultures showed no growth. Not on antibiotics   Associated attestation  - 04/22/2021 3:39 PM EDT   Formatting of this note might be different from the original. Patient seen and examined. Current status reviewed with resident staff. I have reviewed pertinent physician documentation, laboratory and radiographic data. I have initiated therapies based upon this reviewed  In brief 82-year-old woman with history of COPD, mediastinal mass status post VATS with benign thymoma with local recurrence presented with respiratory tract symptoms since 6 days prior to admission COVID testing is positive. In the emergency room she was noted be hypoxemic requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations. She is currently on high-flow feels much improved.  I concur with exam as per Pulmonary fellow. Laboratories and imaging reviewed in detail.  Impression COVID-19 infection COVID-19 pneumonia Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen Thrombocytopenia which is new since 2016 and a poor prognostic sign History of benign thymoma with local recurrence COPD with exacerbation Doubt bacterial pneumonia  Recommendation: Remdesavir 5 days Corticosteroids. Optimum dosing induration of corticosteroids has yet to be fully defined. Decadron 6 mg daily is reasonable however if develops progressive disease in the next 24 hr would escalate corticosteroids and would also add IL 6 inhibitor Additional minerals and vitamin supple role is unclear but probably benign If thrombocytopenia worsens may need alternative anticoagulation. Would check venous Dopplers Supplemental oxygen for saturations greater than 88% Daily PPI unless anticoagulation intensified then would go to q.12 hours Would favor discontinuing antibiotics

                                                was tired a little; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer or other non hcp for herself. This is the first of two reports (report 2 was for her husband). This is a split case of another report with same patient, different dose number (first dose) and event. An 82-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number EN6200; Expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 24Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included tachycardia, benign with a regular rhythm and panic attacks from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing which she has had for 40 years. The patient stated she is anxious person. Patient stated that her tachycardia started when she was 43 years old, and usually gets them periodically. The patient also states she had a routine with different medications and only takes three, but no she didn&#39;t have anything out of the ordinary. No further details provided for concomitant medications. The patient experienced little bit tiredness on 24Feb2021. She wasn&#39;t quite sure if she should call and report this, but her husband said that she should. The patient really didn&#39;t have any aftereffects from the first dose of COVID vaccine. Her arm wasn&#39;t sore. She was tired a little bit and thought that it began probably within an hour or two after her first dose of COVID vaccine in the afternoon. She stated that it lasted fairly long, for several hours. The patient was reluctant at first because she used to work for a doctor&#39;s business office for 20 years and had observed too much and not being a medical person, she put a lot of fear into her mind. This was so quick and fast, but her cardiologist and primary care provider said to get it, so she did. Her husband was reluctant also but at their age they knew that they needed to be protected. They had the fear more out of the quickness on everything and how all at once they had the vaccine but not being a medical people, they listened to their doctors. Patient didn&#39;t remember but tend to think it was in her right arm she got vaccinated. No history of vaccinations with in 4 weeks prior to the first dose of COVID vaccine. No relevant tests were done. She remembered reading articles while waiting for her first dose and tachycardia jumped out at her as a side effect and her husband&#39;s first thought was that seeing that triggered her, but she didn&#39;t have anything after the first dose, so she dismissed it. The outcome of the evet was recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

There were no medical history and no concomitant medications. Everything went fine, she felt good, nothing at all happened; then, in the morning about 8 AM or 9 AM of 20Jan2021, when she got up, she was very dizzy and she fell on to her bed and her little dog jumped on top of her, her dog was scared. She did not know if this normal thing after the vaccine. She is going to go to her regular arthritis doctor on 08Feb2021. She sees an arthritis doctor but she doesn&#39;t think that would have any bearing on this. She didn&#39;t to call them but she was thinking about calling them and telling them about how it felt. The dizziness had majorly resolved but she just feels extremely tired on Jan2021 and she is really okay but she wanted to make sure that they knew what was going on. She is just watching TV and seeing the new president come in and taking it easy today. She felt wonderful the day after she got the dose and she is not very easy person to have problems with her health, she is like a horse so this is surprising to her. She is fine now, just tired which is not anything unusual she just wanted to call to make sure they knew. She is never dizzy, she does not have any problems with her health. The administration of the vaccine does not hurt her at all, just like nothing ever happened. Outcome of the dizziness was recovered on Jan2021 while of the remaining events was unknown.

This is the first of two reports.   An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration injected in the right arm on 16Jan2021 at a single dose as COVID vaccine to avoid getting the virus. Medical history included high blood pressure. The patient had no other patient history. Concomitant medications included warfarin which started maybe 10 years ago and an unspecified medication for high blood pressure. The reporter took her mother, who&#39;s 83, and herself, on Saturday morning and got the COVID vaccine. Her mother woke up Sunday with a 99.8 temperature and she has been coughing real bad (cough) on 17Jan2021. The reporter asked if this was a side effect of the vaccine. This was her mother&#39;s first dose. Her underlying question was, after all this, she heard the second dose was worse, so the reporter wanted to know,  should her mother get the second one if her mother has these symptoms, the reporter heard the second dose was worse and would give some symptoms. Investigation assessment was noted as no. The outcome of &#39;temperature of 99.8&#39; was recovered on Jan2021 as she did not have it anymore and of cough was not recovered.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

She then added that after she got her first shot, she noticed once in a while she couldn&#39;t taste anything but that wasn&#39;t all the time. But now, since she got the second shot, it seemed like all day yesterday, 30Jan2021, and this morning also, that she just can&#39;t taste anything. Then she stated &#34;So, my problem is, would that be a result of the shot?&#34; She stated she was feeling a little bit better today other than that, her mouth - she can&#39;t taste anything. Also, yesterday, she took an extra strength Tylenol every 4 hours to try to help with the pain in her arm on Jan2021; but she has not taken any today. She was just trying to help her arm feel better.

Told it temporally had to be assoc with the vaccine??  I am reporting so that this can be evaluated for confirmation.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

An 83 years old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at age of 83 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hip surgery a few months ago and she was still kind of stiff and sore. Concomitant medications included lisinopril at low dose 10 mg once daily taken for blood pressure abnormal about 10 years ago; clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX) taken for transient ischaemic attack from 2012 (she believed it was a around that time); acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN LOW) at low dose (she began taking this before the Lisinopril so it has been several years).The patient mentioned that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on 02Mar2021 and everything was fine that day and the day after. At late in the day on 04Mar2021, she experienced a lot of problems which she mentioned was the worst experience in her life. She was 99% sure it was from the vaccine because she didn&#39;t experience anything like that before getting the vaccine. She mentioned that she experienced side effects all night like her heart beating really fast, a headache, a stiff neck, her nerves pounding all throughout her body, and a blood pressure of 174/78. She mentioned that it was the worst she&#39;s felt so far as compared to going to the ER, as she&#39;s experienced before. She did not go to the ER as she could not drive herself and she was living alone. She mentioned that she better the next day although it was not totally gone, she was a little shake and kind of weak. As of calling, she said that she was feeling okay and better than yesterday (07Mar2021) in which the effects were still present. She mentioned that it was horrible, very scary, she was very ill, very uncomfortable, really bad, and didn&#39;t want to go through that again. She didn&#39;t know if she would make it through the night. She was asking for what to do and asking if there needed to be an adjustment for her dose because she was a very small person. She didn&#39;t want to have the 2nd shot if she went through that again. It was the worst experience of her life. She was not sure what to do now about her second shot. She had the first shot 02Mar2021 and everything was fine, 03Mar2021 she was okay but on 04Mar2021 she had, by night time, she had a lot of scary things that had never happened to her before. Her heart was pounding she could hear it in her ears. Her head, her neck felt stiff and her head felt heavy, her whole body felt heavy and like the nerves in her whole body were just aggravated, it was hard to explain. She had ringing in her ears. Her blood pressure was 174/78 and she was just afraid to have the second shot, it was scary, it was really bad. She was wondering if the amount of the vaccine was too much for her.  She confirmed it was the evening 04Mar2021 when all this began. She said all of this was pretty well recovered at this point. She said the day after that happened, she was shaky but today (08Mar2021) she was fine. She did not know what it would be medications they are looking for but she was on normal medicine for old people she guesses. This was so bad that she really was not going to take the second dose unless they can tell her if she should or that they should give her less or something like that. The outcome of events was recovered in Mar2021.

An 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported: did not get a card that lists NDC, Lot, Expiration) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. It was also reported that no additional vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient did not require visit to Emergency Room and stated that she was desperate and would&#39;ve gone but she didn&#39;t have a ride and added she is worried about the second. Also, the patient did not required visit to the physician&#39;s office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine and 5 days later she got a terrible reaction. She did not expect it. She had a terrible reaction and thought she was going to die. She stated she wanted to report this because the TV says you should expect some kind of reaction after the second dose but does not say after the first and she said that Pfizer needs to know about this reaction. She stated she heard the second dose is worse. The patient asked if she has to get her second dose and if she needs to report this anywhere else? The patient added &#34;what should I do about side effects?&#34; It was reported that the patient (reported as is almost 84) had the first shot on Sunday 28MAR2021 and everything was fine by Friday she was in terrible trouble really really bad. States she has never heard of this, they say the first is easy and everything was terrible. States every bone and every part of her body hurt on 02Apr2021. She states after 24 hours (03Apr2021) it did go away. The patient asks does this happen to other people? It was stated that her symptoms came on suddenly and she had a severe sore throat, stiff neck, back ache, pain under her ribs, very very weak and shaky, shortness of breath, biceps ached, fatigue, and a tremendous headache. It was stated that started on Friday 02Apr2021 12:00 like a hurricane and after 24 hours they subsided on Saturday 03Apr2021. The patient added that she doesn&#39;t remember getting a card and didn&#39;t know that she should have a card until she saw something about it on TV, and thought well she didn&#39;t get a card. The patient also asked what does she do about that?  The patient states she takes medication but not that affects this. The outcome of the events recovered on 03Apr2021.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a Contactable consumer (patient). An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was none medical history. Concomitant medication included atenolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Her leg was swollen and there was edema and there was a lump on the side and it was pink or getting red and she was on medicine (Clarification Unknown) for 7 days, twice a day and the leg is still (incomplete sentence), the edema has gone down some. The leg was still pink and it is tender to touch and if she stand on her leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts. She got pain. She was also sleeping whereby she was watching television and all of sudden she was sound sleep and she wake up over an hour or two after that and then she awake for a while but she have no trouble sleeping at night again. She had chest pain and it&#39;s not angina because that she did have (Further clarification was unknown if consumer had angina in past hence not captured on tab) but it&#39;s a sharp pain and it does not want her taking Nitroglycerin because it went away and it last for maybe (incomplete sentence) it just like a stabbed wound. She was dizzy. That&#39;s still, it&#39;s not like what it was but it is getting less but she was still dizzy. She cannot walk a straight line. She lived in an apartment house and she had to walk down the hall to go down the stair but she sometime had to stop because she was dizzy. she kind of lean against the wall for few seconds and then she continued on. Concern was not the word for it. It made her very nervous and the circulation was very poor in both feet now and one leg, the right leg that has the pink and still the tenderness in that leg. The foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that she had turned dark purple. She wrote everything down and she will say this at the time after the injection she did not have any problem until about four days later but she did have problem with doing my cross- word puzzles and doing her puzzles. She could not do any of her puzzles, nothing was computing in her brain (Clarification unknown) but that&#39;s coming back slowly, so is that to be expected. Start date of event: Consumer stated &#34;It was 4 days after the 5th, about 09Feb2021. She went there and saw a doctor an MD of course and she went there on 12th so it was a week later. She went because the pain was terrible. The outcome of events Leg is still pink and it is tender to touch; If I stand on my leg for too long or walking around too much it hurts, I got pain; Dizzy; is not recovered, all of sudden she was sound sleep; Cannot walk a straight line; Nervous; Circulation is very poor in both feet now; Foot turns very dark pink and the big toe that I have turned dark purple; Nothing was computing in my brain; pain was terrible was unknown, outcome of the other events was recovering. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

On 09Mar2021, the patient was shutting down. On the same day at 18:30, the patient had gone in the bathroom and said it burned when she peed. So, the patient was taken to urgent care so it would not get out of hand.

An 84-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3249 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 14Jan2021 09:00 at a single dose for vaccination. Medical history included Defibrillator and she is on oxygen. The patient had no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no concomitant medications. When the reporter (patient&#39;s caregiver) got to the patient&#39;s house on 15Jan2021, the patient had a temperature of 100.5 and did not feel good. She gave the patient 2 paracetamol (TYLENOL), water and put her in bed. She was going to wake her up in a few minutes and will retake her temperature. She would like to know what to do and what do they recommend. It was reported that the patient got her first dose on 14Jan2021 and that night, she was not feeling good but the reporter did not know if the patient took her temperature, and the patient just went to bed. In the morning of 15Jan2021, the reporter got there about 11:00 and when she checked her temperature and found it was 100.5. The patient has a defibrillator and she is on oxygen. The patient had fever of 100.5 on 15Jan2021. The patient is in bed and the reporter wanted to ask for opinion on what to do because she was not familiar with any of this stuff and she just saw the paperwork that they had from the vaccination so she was calling to know what does she need. She gave her 2 TYLENOLs at 11:45 and told the patient that they will see within an hour. The outcome of the event pyrexia was not recovered while the outcome of the event malaise was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

This consumer reported for herself that a 84-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL3247) first dose, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced she began sneezing on the way to get the second dose the covid 19 vaccine today and has not stopped since on 22Jan2021, when she starts sneezing like this, she then stars coughing and her nose stops up on an unspecified date, picked up an allergy on an unspecified date.  Patient stated she began sneezing on the way to get the second dose the Covid 19 vaccine today and has not stopped since.  She would like to know if she could take a Benadryl.  When she started sneezing like this, she then started coughing and her nose stopped up. She was experiencing all these symptoms currently.  The patient had a question: she had the second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine, may she took a Benadryl, she didn&#39;t want anything to affect the vaccine working, someone suggested not taking things like aspirin, Aleve, Tylenol, 24 hours after the vaccine, as it may effect the potency. She sneezed before the shot, now she was not blaming the shot, she went out and walked this morning and may have picked up an allergy, but she sneezed all the way to the shot, and she has been sneezing all afternoon and her nose was stopped up, she wanted to know if can take Benadryl, she wanted to clarify this started before she had the shot. She hasn&#39;t had this in years this bad, she was stopped up this afternoon, and thought to take a Benadryl that can help this, but she didn&#39;t want to mess the shot up. The outcome of event sneezing was not recovered, outcome for other events was unknown.

The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

That evening for both, I started aching a lot in both arms and shoulders, couldn&#39;t sleep and extremely tired the next day.  The following day I was back to normal and the symptoms gone.  The second shot had a little stronger symptoms. I had covid in early November, 2020 in case that matters.    Also, I had a flu shot late October and had a severe reaction which led to my being diagnosed with covid.

An 84-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose in Feb2021 (9 days before this report) for Covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had little reaction like fever in Feb2021 and also went to the hospital. The event was considered life threatening. The outcome of event was unknown.  Reporter wanted to know if her reaction was related to the vaccine even though she received it 9 days before, if it was possible that she was exposed to the virus and since she already received the vaccine if it will test false positive, and if she tested positive will she still be able to receive the 2nd dose.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported dizziness and a headache after receiving the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was hypertensive (150/88) with an FSBG of 188mg/dl. EKG demonstrated pacer rhythm, no ectopy. The patient refused EMS transport. The patient then proceeded to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient reported feeling lightheaded, a headache, and nausea without vomiting. During the ED visit, the patient reported mild improvement, but stated that she noticed some lightheadedness when standing. The physician administered 1L IV saline bolus, 4mg Zofran IV, and 1G of Acetaminophen PO. Tests were relatively unremarkable. The patient had improved and was discharged with diagnoses of Medication reaction (Pfizer COVID vaccine), HA, Dizziness, and Orthostasis without hypotension.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

                                                Patient received 1st dose Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/5/2021 and second dose on 2/26/21.  She had no adverse reaction to either dose.  Around 3/2/2021, she saw her physician complaining of pain in her arm, which was attributed to gout.  At the time, she also had a nonproductive cough, generalized weakness and one episode of loose stool.  She presented to the emergency room on 3/7/21 with significant hypoxia.  She tested positive for COVID 19 by both rapid test and PCR.  A quantitative test for COVID antibodies was sent out to a reference lab on 3/7/2021 and resulted on 3/11/2021 as &gt;250 U/mL.  Pt. required CPAP, BiPAP, High Flow Oxygen and ultimately intubation.  Was not oxygen dependent before hospitalization. Pt. treated with dexamethasone, 2 doses of Remdesivir (then held due to acute kidney injury), tocilizumab X 1 dose, 1 unit COVID-19 convalescent plasma.  Pt. expired on 3/19/2021.  Sample sent for genome sequencing to check for variants of interest in joint effort between pathology and infectious disease.  Report not yet available.

A 84-Year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3949, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: May2021) intramuscularly given very high in the top of left arm on 04Feb2021 9:20 AM at 0.3 ml single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included fractured skull (five years ago), shingles (two years ago) and bleeding ulcers. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE last 04Feb2021 at 9:20 AM - Same day 6:00 PM started to have achy arm - After a few days developed symptoms like extremely ill, extreme fatigue, nausea, muscle aches. DSU potential duplicate AE Report E transmit - According to the patient she had already reported the side effects and transferred to our department. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced arm started to ache like hell. Tiredness, muscle pain, nausea and feeling horribly ill. It was reported that, &#34;she was having some symptoms. She got her vaccination on the 04Feb2021 and developed the symptoms yesterday. Her doctor was very alarmed that it was not just usual symptoms that go along with the vaccine because of the length of time between when she got it and when she developed symptoms. He was afraid she had COVID. She needed to know if that was normal so she could get back to him. Caller clarified that she meant side effects. She wanted to know whether it was normal to have gotten the vaccine on 04Feb2021 and not develop side effects until 09Feb2021. The vaccination was given in the morning at 9:20 AM and she did not have any symptoms until 6:00 PM that evening. Her arm started to ache like hell. That one showed up then, but cleared up in a couple of days. The arm got better and better. The other set of side effects started yesterday which was tiredness, muscle pain, nausea, and feeling horribly ill. She felt awful and did not want to go to a hospital if it was not necessary. HCP information included she had only seen him a couple of times. She had a long term doctor that retired and she got shifted over to him. They did not have a good relationship she must say. His whole group was associated with where she got the vaccine. They were all virtual now. She had been on lock down for a year. She did not have the doctor&#39;s address, phone number, or email. Tiredness, muscle pain, nausea, and feeling horribly ill: started yesterday morning when she got up between 4:30 AM and 5:00 AM. She was so woozy and thought it was left over sleep. She felt unwell all day. She had felt unwell today, but not as bad as yesterday. She had to get vaccination card out of hand bag and needs her glasses to read the small numbers. First dose was given on 04Feb2021. She had appointment on 25Feb2021 for second dose. Healthcare Provider who gave the vaccine was Hospital. They called her on the third at 5:00 PM to see if she could come the next day for the vaccine. They did a good job. Her brother was a retired anesthesiology and she called him this morning and he said to go to the hospital or testing center. Then he agreed that she should call Pfizer. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect were none. She did not get her flu shot in anticipation of getting the COVID vaccine. Her brother and his granddaughter were both anesthesiologist. They get work up about not being able to breathe and ventilators. They gave advice. She was glad her brother approved for her to call Pfizer to find out. She wanted to believe it was side effects. She had been on lock down. Her brother said she could have been exposed at the vaccine site. Caller stated everyone had on a mask. She was not obese. She was not sure if it is relevant, but she would tell it anyway. She fractured her skull 5 years ago and was in Hospital because it was bleeding. That had resolved. She was in ICU and then six weeks of acute rehab. She had a bad case of shingles two years ago which led to bleeding ulcers. Again she went to the hospital, but she was scoped they found ulcers and treated. She went back for scope again and it had all healed up&#34;. Outcome of the event have achy arm was recovering whereas other events was unknown.

I called 911, and when the paramedics came, her blood pressure was very low and she was sweating heavily.  She was very weak and couldn&#39;t stand up.  She had a similar episode 10 days earlier while having a bowel movement (and also experience diarrhea at that time).  She was taken to the ER and was admitted to the hospital for 2 days where testing was done.

This pharmacist reported that an 85-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown) intramuscular at single dose on 21Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the first dose on unknown date. Relevant history and concomitants drugs were not reported. Per reporter, the patient was not seeing anything crazy on her chart. The patient got the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 21Jan2021. On 22Jan2021, she had been tested positive for COVID-19 (COVID-19 Rapid test).  The patient had cough and low grade fever since unknown date. Relevant test was none. Outcome of event was unknown. The nurse practitioner wanted to do a monoclonal antibody infusion and the pharmacist was wondering if they could do that?   When probed for causality, the pharmacist responded: &#34;I guess not I&#39;m not going to comment on that, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t have the patient&#39;s actual file.&#34;  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, lack of efficacy of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. However, individuals may not be protected until at least 7 days after their second dose of the vaccine. It is unlikely that the patient would have fully developed immunity due to the very short time lag between the second vaccine dose and the event onset.

I was  totally bedridden for several days, getting up only for necessities  I lived on Ibuprofen.  I would get up, take two Ibuprofen, and sit for an hour before I could func.   My arm hurt.  The worst part is that my brain felt as if it were all swelled up, pushing against my skull.   I could not perform  normal tasks  at all ,  until the last couple of days.   I could not think, reason or remember at all until the last 2-3 days,  I had to get substitutes to teach my classes.  I could not write nor communicate  nor pay my bills.  I have a manuscript overdue.  I am now staying at night with friends, for neither they nor I trust me to function normally alone.

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Started abating by Thursday 2/25/21 evening. Advised ice pack on arm, but pt. said it was too sore on day after dose given (Wednesday) to apply. Pt. took one aspirin on Wednesday morning. Advised her she could take a second later in the day. (Yesterday pt. stated she had taken a Tylenol. Today upon review she realized that she took an aspirin. Ibuprofen is also available. Advised pt. take an ibuprofen now over the phone as I waited. Taken at 8:13pm EST. No further medication taken on Wednesday. (Also encouraged ice pack on neck Wednesday for ongoing strong headache / neck pain yesterday. Pt. does not remember if she tried that. Head/neck pain resolved today.) Pt. states swelling today (Thursday) is mild-to-moderate, less than yesterday, but still noticeable. Doesn&#39;t hurt as much as it did yesterday, she says. She can now lift her arm without pain.

She is now on antibiotics. This is strange to have an infection which makes us feel the needle was not properly sterilized? Something foreign entered at the time of that shot and we would like to have answers. The doctors could not even identify why this happened.  Company Pfizer..

An 85-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021, 11:00 am as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension, stroke, heart attack, COVID-19 in Aug2020 (actually had COVID this summer in August, had the mild case), and emergency surgery in Aug2020. Concomitant medications included ajmaline (CARDIA), isosorbide, and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for cardiac disorder; and losartan. The patient her first dose on 04Feb2021 and experienced headaches, muscle aches and pains, chills, other flu-like symptoms, heart conditions, and sensitivity to eggs. She mentioned that this was normal and nothing unusual. She received her second dose on 25Feb2021 at 11:00 am. She was still kind of stiff but was okay. The next day on 26Feb2021 at 11:00 am, she noticed bright red bleeding in her urine when she emptied her bladder. After a few hours it faded. On the next day on 27Feb2021, she experienced the bright red bleeding in the urine again. The red blood did not hurt and patient was achy and headachy, &#34;you know muscles.&#34; So, that kind of happened and it just kind of eased off. She slept a lot because she felt tired and so rotten from Friday, Saturday, Sunday after getting the shot. She also had a mild low-grade fever, headaches, and body aches and pains which she considered normal. Patient was hard of hearing and did not have a bright red bleeding, just had a taint little bit till the day when she got it and then the next day, she went to the bathroom to empty her bladder again and had bright red bleeding again with some blood clots in it. Then she did not really have that much the rest of the day and since then it seems to be clear. She did have a little bit of discomfort and her skin was dry. She have never had that experience before so she was just not sure was that connected with that shot? She wanted to know if there were any other patients that have had that. Patient also stated, &#34;I have a bit trouble in seeing. So, I am going to have my magnifying glass&#34; when asked about the product details. She will be getting her annual check up on 24Mar2021 so she will also check with her doctor. She mentions that she doesn&#39;t take that much flu-shots because she is sensitive to eggs. Her urine seems to be clear as of the time of report. She wants to know if the bright red bleeding in the urine has been reported. Patient stated, &#34;I used to be 5&#39;7&#34; but now I am 5&#39;4&#34;. I think I am weighing about 158 now. I am sorry like I said because of my hearing and with a language difference a little bit. I was having a trouble hearing you.&#34; The patient did not have treatment for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 85-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 (at 85-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient got vaccinated on 21Jan2021 and last, within a week, about a week, still she was having some rash on her throat (Jan2021).

She just wanted to report that, she don&#39;t know, it has been better sometimes but she have been having it from three or four days now and she just wondered if they might want to know or Pfizer might want to know that she does have a rash on her throat, just on the front part of her throat. The patient got some topical itch medicine as it itches (treatment). Weight was reported as about 112 or 114 pounds. The outcome of the events was unknown.

So, she was not sure.

The patient was a passenger in her car. She was found to be responsive but slumped, and lethargic. She is both demented and also non-English speaking. The daughter functioned as a historian and interpreter. She reported the patient was not feeling well on the way to the vaccine and that the drive from home was long. Just prior to the vaccine, the patient had emesis in the vehicle. The vaccine was given. The patient entered the monitoring area and started to report chest tightness. Unfortunately, she was not able to give much more of history at the time of the interview. EMS was summoned and the vehicle was moved to the monitoring area adjacent to the EMS post. The daughter reported that the patient has had a &#34;small heart attack&#34; within the past few months, for which she was hospitalized.

After the vaccine, she had no new symptoms or signs of vaccine reaction and MD friend reports that he checked her pulse which was not elevated from baseline. On 1/16,  she awakened and continued to feel at her recent baseline. However, in the early afternoon, she complained of  headache, nausea/epigastric pain, and chest heaviness. These apparently were not unusual symptoms for her to feel intermittently.  Per her niece, who has a home O2 sat device, her 02 sat that morning was 97 with a HR of 87 irregularly irregular. She was afebrile. (continue on page 2)

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Approximately 35 minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patients daughter came back to the pharmacy (sobbing) and saying that her mom was complaining of dizziness and &#34;not feeling well at all&#34;.   I offered to call 911  and did so after she consented.  The police arrived within two minutes and the ambulance arrived approximately 90 seconds later.  The police officer was interviewing the patient (who was still conscious and alert) about what was wrong.  I was asked what the patient received.  I responded that she had been given the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and was then told that I could go back inside by the EMT&#39;s who showed up relatively soon thereafter.

                                                Congestive cough; Weakness; didn&#39;t have an appetite; legs felt stiff, or almost frozen; Severe muscle weakness/extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body; tremendous fatigue/Tiredness; Couldn&#39;t walk; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers. An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL9262 expiry date 21May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Feb2021 (at the age of 86 years old) at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number EL8982) on 22Jan2021 at single dose in upper right arm and on 22Jan2021 experienced severe headache and arm hurting. Relevant medical history includes ongoing compromised immune system diagnosed many years ago, and ongoing one kidney functioning. The patient received no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021 the patient experienced high, over the top blood pressure, delirious incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware which both required hospitalization from 13Feb2021 to 14Feb2021. It was also reported they were concerned about one kidney/ was dehydrated in 13Feb2021. On 13Feb2021 unspecified blood labs showed kidney was extremely dehydrated and Chest X-ray was good. Clinical course was reported as follows: she was just released from hospital yesterday, she took the second Pfizer COVID shot, on 12Feb2021, and became so very very ill, she expected some side effects, the first shot wasn&#39;t bad, the first all she had was a severe headache and arm hurting, but that was 3 weeks ago, and the second one she can&#39;t say how horrible it was: she had to get the paramedics there, she was very very ill. It was the worst night she has had, and she is 86 years old, and has had a multitude of serious issues but that shot was the worst. It was a combination of high blood pressure, over the top, and insomnia like she couldn&#39;t budge and open her eyes, she couldn&#39;t see anything but squares, it was like a horrible, if there is such a thing as a trip, a horrible trip, something she can&#39;t imagine wishing on anyone. The county administered it, she has several doctor, she initially provides her primary care doctor, for consent to contact, but says her nephrologist would be better, as she hasn&#39;t seen her primary care doctor in some time. Her primary care doctor doesn&#39;t know she had this, another doctor gave her permission, her nephrologist. States they were more concerned in the hospital about her kidney, she has one kidney functioning and, on mistake of the hospital, they didn&#39;t connect her to hydration, the night nurse didn&#39;t, and she was dehydrated and it was affecting her kidney. Her husband tried to call Saturday, when she had this reaction at like 06:30/07:00, but there was a huge long wait, he was calling to see about side effects, but they were beyond waiting, had to get the paramedics, her blood pressure was 178/113 and heart rate was 103. First shot was 3 weeks back. It looks like she had it on 22Jan2021, the headache and arm hurting started towards the evening, the shot was taken earlier in the day, and they started in the evening, her headache was quite severe, but with Tylenol it went away, the arm is still sore from the second vaccine, but is slightly better. Clarifies she was hospitalized for the blood pressure and delirium, like, it is best explained, like delirious: incapable of sleeping, insomnia and inability to be awake and aware, all she could see was, like if she talked about people who did LSD and trips, it was a bad trip, it was squares, she wanted to open her eyes, but could only see squares. She fell asleep Friday night about 11PM, and felt this at 04:00, and she pulled off her sleep apnea mask, she had to run to the restroom, she was weak, feeling like she would slip onto the floor, and had to get right in bed, and the insomnia continued until about 7AM, that was when she started to be able to focus on like words, she was able to say words in her mind, it was like a bad nightmare. She was admitted to the hospital, she was in the emergency room (ER), the paramedics took her there Saturday, about 07:30, took her to the hospital after immediate heart checking, an intravenous (IV) of some kind, and brought her to the hospital and she was in X-rays and what not, they did procedures in the ER, and they suggested her to be observed overnight, they watched her and things started to become more normal, but she is still not clear headed, she is woozy, like foggy. High, over the top blood pressure outcome: It has been back to a good blood pressure. Insomnia is ok- she slept ok last night. What is left: the night she woke up, so early Sunday morning, in the hospital, she was profusely sweating like someone came to her room and showered her bed with water, her sheets and blankets were soaked and this morning she woke, she got up, was still very woozy, and asked her husband to help get her out of bed, and she changed her nightgown and after an hour she got in the shower, as she was sweating again, not sweating, but occasionally on and off chills, she is taking off her nightshirt and putting on a bed jacket, she gets warm and cold, hot and cold. She had blood labs a chest X-ray, heart monitor the whole time until she was discharged, and everything was good except the kidney was extremely dehydrated. This was all on Saturday as well. On her first visit to get the vaccine, at that time, the facility was a big mall, and they handed her what to look for after the injection, and she didn&#39;t notice until this morning, it says if you have an immune system that is compromised, it could affect it, and she has immune system that is compromised diagnosed many years ago. Over the top blood pressure and insomnia had resolved, arm sore was resolving, dehydrated and affecting kidney had not resolved, final outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Starts around 4 pm.  Lot of pain right side of face like:  1.  toothache, whole jaw aches   2.  neck arthritis   3. sinus infection  4.  ear infection all at the same time.  Strong pain all through right side of face, sometimes up through eye.  Worse lying down.  Cause?   Dental exam complete mouth x-rays indicated no problems with any teeth.  Saw Dr. 3/3/2021, was checked for ear, sinus infections, felt all around my neck, no problems.  Prescribed gabapentin, told to continue the Tylenol Arthritis I had been taking on my own.  Symptoms continue today, only right side of face, head, temple area, sometimes up through right eye, teeth on right side ache.  Only take the Tylenol once a day since that is all that I need it.  More painful if I lie down in bed at night so sit upright until pain is gone; then sleep through the night.  No problem all during the day when I?m up and around doing whatever. . .no pain then.  Someone in my dental office has the same symptoms along with Bells Palsy, was told by her doctor it&#39;s from the Covid shot and could last 3 months? Pharmacist also told me filling the gabapentin for several others with same symptoms (I live in a small town).

We placed her in a wheelchair and she then said that her throat was closing up.  She said that it felt like someone was choking her.  A moment later, she felt like her jaws felt huge.  We quickly gave her about four or five large glasses of water  (one right after the other) and quickly took her blood pressure which went up to 170/80.  We then gave her one of her blood pressure pills.  After this, she started to finally feel better.

                                                Fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 86-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscularly, administered in the left arm on 23Feb2021 at 11:32 (Batch/Lot Number: EN5318) at 86-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine.  Medical history included hypertension from 1981 and ongoing, ongoing High cholesterol from an unspecified date (&#34; not sure 40 yrs. ago&#34;). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) for COVID-19 immunization on 02Feb2021 (first dose, right arm, intramuscularly, Lot Number: EN5318 11:30).On an unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as 08Feb2021), the patient experienced fatigue (non-serious); with no treatment received. The clinical course was reported as follows: The adverse events occurred six days after the first vaccination, which kept the patient in bed for half a day. At which time her appetite returned, and the dizziness and nausea stopped. It really did not seem significant now, because after the second dose, the patient had no reaction at all; not even a sore arm, except feeling tired (as reported). There were no relevant tests. The clinical outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient considered that the bnt162b2 had a causal effect to the adverse event.

By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ?

                                                The day after the first shot, my mother had bad knee pain in her left knee. It went on for days/week. After the second dose, days out she started feel very tired and bad pain in her feet that went to her hands and she couldn&#39;t get out of bed or urinate properly. Her facility doctor gave her Gabepentin for the pain but it did not help. She declined over a week or so and then She was admitted into the hospital for dehydration (March 19, 2021). The put a catheter in her to get urine out and bring her kidney function back to her normal (she does have kidney disease). Gave her more Gabepentin (which does not help pain in feet an hands) and released her to rehab. and she is now on oxygen.  Rehab was bad so I got her out and released to her facility so she could receive rehab there. She declined again with the same reaction: extreme fatigue, can&#39;t walk and now urinates and defecates in an adult diaper and now breathing is very labored.  She was admitted to the hospital and they can&#39;t find out why she is in this way. They did blood work, tests, scan and X-rays without any answers. They switched up meds on her and then released her to rehab since she hasn&#39;t walked in weeks/month at this point. She is regaining strength but now on oxygen even when sitting. She is 86 and walked with a walker all around her facility and when going to doctor appointments. Now she is in a wheelchair for doctor appointments since she has no strength and needs oxygen to walk. Her facility saw her decline after the second shot and my mom is very vocal and each day told them how she felt awful and it is because of the shot. She still has neuropathy in her feet and hands but it is not as painful as it originally was and it peaked and now just painful about a 5-6 on a scale of 0-10.

Historical Vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number EK4176) on 27Jan2021 received in one of her arms for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe pain in her left knee. The patient received the second vaccine on 17Feb2021. A week out or so she started having pain in her feet and she was very fatigued 19Mar2021; both still ongoing, both on a week. The patient had had 2 stints at the hospital, and 2 rehabs. Both of these have very slightly improved. The patient went to the hospital due to the pain in her feet that moved up to her hands, she was very fatigued, and she couldn&#39;t walk; she was bedridden on 19Mar2021. Weeks after the shot it continued day after day after day up until 19Mar2021 where she was admitted to the hospital. The patient just had her last stint in rehab this past 2 weeks and could get up with physical therapy. Hospitalization was from 19Mar2021 to 27Mar2021.

Now she was incontinent and had to wear diapers. She urinates in diapers and defecates in diapers. The incontinence started sometime during 19Mar2021 to 27Mar2021 and it is ongoing, persisting. In the hospital they could not find anything seriously wrong with her. The patient had total fatigue and the caller begged them to give her mother a (vitamin) B12 shot. They gave it to her but there was no improvement with patient&#39;s energy. They put a catheter in her to get her kidney function back to her normal level. It was because she was not urinating properly. They ran a bunch of tests and there was not anything wrong with her. They did cardiac tests, lung tests, and XRays. The patient&#39;s breathing was labored. Started sometime after the second shot leading up to the hospital and that the patient had to be on oxygen. She said she was still on oxygen and that the labored breathing was ongoing, persisting. Reporter said all of these above listed were from 25Apr2021 to 03May2021.

The patient was on oxygen 24/7, all day when she was walking, sitting in a room in her wheelchair. The caller said she was hoping patient could get up and walk around but she was still weak.

An 87-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included leg problem, it&#39;s severe pain in the right leg in the back; very bad nerves. Concomitant medication included oxycodone hydrochloride, paracetamol (PERCOCET [OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE;PARACETAMOL]) for pain in her right leg.

Caller stated that she had the injection on Monday (18Jan2021) at fair grounds, its the Covid Vaccine. She didn&#39;t feel good the day she got it on Monday. Then Tuesday she felt good. Wednesday (20Jan2021) she was sick again, and having pains in the stomach, well she can&#39;t say stomach, but also towards the afternoon around 2&#39;o clock, she got light headed and dizzy, she felt like she was about to pass out (21Jan2021), and she thought to herself she had to hurry and get something to eat and that feeling last 4-5 hours. She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects. While on the phone with this call handler, caller states that she was starting to get dizzy again but she just had breakfast.

On 21Jan2021 Thursday she felt dizzy, like she was going to pass out. On 22Jan2021 Friday she was feeling dizzy again, and her stomach was acting up and she was weak again. Caller was dizzy and weak. The dizziness was a different each time, sometimes she has got it, sometimes she didn&#39;t, its intermittent, she would be doing something and then she needed to grab a hold of something when the dizziness come on. Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy. When attempting to get the product details, caller states that she was getting old, she provided EL3248, she needed light to read it. The card did have an Expiry date but she can&#39;t read it, it&#39;s 20 something, she just can&#39;t read. She was on nothing new.

On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday. She had No results to share but she had a X ray a couple weeks ago (Jan2021), and that would lead up to MRI she was going to have. Caller stated that she had very bad nerves, her husband passed away 2 years ago and she hasn&#39;t overcome that, she lived by her-self, and was wondering if some of this stress, would lead to the symptoms she was having right now.

                                                COVID; COVID; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 87-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 maybe about 11:30am at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing lung disorder started maybe 10 years ago or more, ongoing eye disorder onset may have been about 1 year ago, Carpel tunnel surgery on Jan2021 which was done on both wrists, ongoing weight decreased about 2 years ago, patient had cancer and has had some problems; they were going to the health clinics at the time and she had a horrible cough; she thinks, but does not know, if they did a bronchoscopy; but she saw some doctors and a cancer specialist. The patient had unknown concomitant medications for Thyroid. The patient was diagnosed with COVID 23Jan2021 and hospitalized in response which is ongoing. She is scheduled to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 27Jan2021. The patient body temperature is usually about 97.5 or 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit; but on Saturday: 23Jan2021 her temperature was 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient had her son take her to the hospital where they did the COVID test and it was positive for COVID; so she was admitted to the hospital for this on 23Jan2021. She is hospitalized at the same hospital where she was administered the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and the hospital staff were shocked that she had gotten one of their Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccines. The patient was at the hairdresser&#39;s on 22Jan2021 who said the patient did not look good then; that she really looked sick; but apparently the patient did not have any symptoms 22Jan2021. It was not until unknown time on 23Jan2021 that her temperature went up; patient feels like her reaction is to the fever; where she just wants to sleep all the time. Patient probably does not have any energy. Caller does not hear her coughing when she talks to the patient. Caller clarified that to her awareness the patient&#39;s potential exposure to COVID positive persons would have been through the grocery store; or the health plex gym where caller and the patient go together but the patient said the health plex gym machines are spaced out well and there are no known exposures to COVID positive persons. Outcome of events was unknown.

An 87-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EN5318, expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 01Feb2021 at a single dose as vaccine for COVID-19. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications.  On 01Feb2021 23:00, the patient experienced hallucinations. It was reported that patient started hallucinating on 01Feb2021 23:00 and just saw people but never heard voices. The reporter stated that her mom never had hallucinations ever. The patient feared people were in the house and stayed up all night (from 01Feb2021 23:00), slept all day (on 02Feb2021). The reporter wanted to know if they have ever heard of this happening. She has made an appointment with the patient&#39;s doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 87-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 01Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure abnormal, glaucoma, thyroid problems, mild cognitive impairment and memory problem. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin and carvedilol for blood pressure, donepezil for mild cognitive impairment, ezetimibe, levothyroxine for thyroid problems and ongoing latanoprost for glaucoma. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3246) on 11Jan2021 for covid-19 immunization. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient had fallen, did not hit her head, but she has extreme fatigue, memory loss (she has seen some improvement now) unable to be by herself now and take her medications. The patient had a mild case of memory loss and had delirium. The reporter cannot say these events occurred from the vaccine of course. However, the work up that has been done has been negative and reporter was worried. It was reported that the patient had a little memory problem prior to getting the vaccine, however, now it was worse. It was like the patient cannot be alone now. The patient did not have a stroke. However, this like sent the patient over a cliff. This is a life changing event. If patient gets better it&#39;s all good, but if she does not they are in big trouble. Patient was previously able to care for self and now she was not able too. Patient underwent lab test (unknown result) in Feb2021. Patient was taken to Urgent Care, was seen by a physician and basic blood work was done and a urine test was done (unknown result). The outcome of event delirium was recovering; all other events was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

An 87-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 05Feb2021 at 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 86-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced urinary tract infection; the patient previously took clindamycin hydrochloride (DYNACIN) and experienced allergy, gabapentin and experienced allergy, doxycycline which made her pass out and lose complete control of muscles and everything and put her in the hospital for 3 days.  The patient experienced severe headache on 14Feb2021; the patient collapsed because of weakness in her legs/ legs collapsed on her and experienced pain in her legs/leg pain, weakness/real weak and fatigue, all on 22Feb2021; shaky/real shaky on 24Feb2021, vomiting on 26Feb2021, thigh pain and hip pain on 27Feb2021. Clinical course: on 22Feb2021 she saw her primary care physician for leg pain, weakness, fatigue and the same severe headache that she was seen for on 14Feb2021. On 22Feb2021 she was prescribed cyclobenzaprine and tramadol as pain medication. Before she took any of the cyclobenzaprine or tramadol on the night of 22Feb2021 her legs collapsed on her. On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again, and he said to stop the cyclobenzaprine and changed tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the tramadol and start taking TYLENOL. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being really shaky and real weak.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: everything was ok (her bloodwork is fine) on an unspecified date, computerized tomogram (CAT scan): everything checked out just fine on 14Feb2021, Urine test: urinary tract infection on 04Feb2021  and worsened urinary tract infection on 16Feb2021.   Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with cyclobenzaprine (strength: 5mg) as a muscle relaxer and tramadol (strength: 50 mg) as pain medication both from 22Feb2021, tramadol was stopped on 26Feb2021 and TYLENOL (every 8 hrs. strength: 650 mg, Lot Number: SBA002, Expiry date: Dec2022) was started on the same date. The patient outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 87-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL3249; Expiration Date: May2021) intramuscularly administered in right deltoid on 02Feb2021 at 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension (she had hypertension, or high blood pressure, which she was treated for). There were no concomitant medications. Caller says she has not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. On 02Feb2021, the patient experienced cough, nasal congestion, fatigue and pain in arm, on an unspecified date, patient experienced chills, diarrhoea and no appetite. Retired RN (registered nurse) called as patient about the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, who says she was wondering about the shot that she got the first dose of last Tuesday. She says she has been looking at the sheet of side effects etc, and she had cough, which was not listed, and nasal congestion, no appetite, chills, and diarrhoea started on the second or third day after getting the vaccine. Caller says her cough started when she came home, and she was really exhausted after that, the cough was not bad. She asks if the vaccine is made in Germany. She says that the fatigue and pain in her arm lasted three days. Caller says that she feels it is medically significant, and she is not going back for the second shot. She took Mucinex for the nasal congestion, and for her diet she ate soup. Caller says this medication was over the counter and not prescription. Caller says that she feels it is medically significant, and she is not going back for the second shot. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She finally got up and went into the bathroom and by 3:30 had coughed up little round, clear jellyfish.  Then she stopped coughing and went back to bed for 15 minutes, and then at 3:45 started getting diarrhea which she had until 10:30 AM.   She called Pfizer and reported her reaction and talked to them. During that time she had a lot of diarrhea and her body was starting to ache, joints and muscles.  She did not take her temperature and went back to bed, and slept until she could get up and go to the bathroom.  She then took her temperature and it was 100.7, which her normal is 97. 3.  She slept from 11:00 PM Wednesday until 11:00 AM Thursday.  She could not stay awake for long  before falling back to sleep.  Yesterday she did sleep most all of the day, and did not eat anything since Tuesday evening and did have a piece of toast yesterday.  Today, 3/19/21 she is able to get up, dressed and gotten downstairs to get something to eat and has lost 6# in this time period.  She is feeling wimpy, and her temp is down to 97.3, her pulse ox is 98%, pulse in the 70s.  She&#39;s achy, and has rubbed on Aspercreme  and has taken Tylenol a couple of times.  She is still very weak, probably dehydrated and going to get something to eat as she has just gotten up.  She is foggy thinking, but feels that once she rests, eats and gets strength she will be fine.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn. Medical history included hiatus hernia surgery from Nov2019, surgery from an unknown date, vomited after surgery for three nights/days, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cancer, feet burning, feet red, asthma and thyroid. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), fluid pill, vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, acid reflux pill before nighttime before supper, thyroid pill, singulair pill. The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression..&#34; She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn&#39;t get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that&#39;s the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn&#39;t know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight. The action taken in response to the event for gabapentin was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event &#34;Pain in arm&#34; was recovering, the outcome of the event fatigue was not recovered, the outcome of the events &#34;temperature 99.2&#34; and &#34;Vomiting&#34; was recovered, and outcome of other events was unknown.

She says that this was her second dose of the vaccine, she had no reaction to the first, not even a sore arm. She initially provides PF12ER as LOT for her first dose she received on 14Jan2021. She says that her Tylenol is finally kicking in, she feels a lot better, she might go sleep it off. She clarifies that she has been taking Tylenol PM from a great big bottle, that she cannot read fine print, it is huge green bluish aqua colored. She says the dose is 500mg, it was very effective at 04:30AM to 08:30AM, and she took it again about 11:00AM. She says she is just now having another shooting pain in her upper right head.

A 88-Years-old white female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9266, expiration date: 31 May 2021), via intramuscularly in left arm on 14Feb2021 at a dose of 0.3ml as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s history included allergies to Penicillin, Cortisone, and she thinks also to Lidocaine, maybe. The patient did not have any NDC numbers, Lot numbers or expiry to provide for any of these products, as it was years ago. The patient did not receive any other medications. On 14Feb2021 about an hour after she got her vaccine; the patient had waited 40 minutes after getting the vaccine shot, and nothing happened, so she left, and while she was on her way home, she got a sensation in her nose, throat and upper chest like it was warm, and there was dryness. The patient previously used to get allergy shots because she was allergic to horse flies, and within 24 hours of being bitten, she would have hives the size of dinner plates. The patient went through allergy shots for 10 years and then she moved away and was no longer near water, so she did not think she needed the shots anymore. The patient had been getting the shots for 10 years, she would start to get where her lips felt funny and stuff after getting the shot, and her reaction to the COVID vaccine, felt similar to that, but it had dissipated within a half hour. This was probably respiratory and was not major, her nose did not close up, but it did get dry. The event resolved within an hour. The patient inquired with three physicians about if she should get the COVID vaccine, because she had an anaphylactic experience 40 years ago, before she was going to the allergist, and she had to go to the ER (emergency room), and they gave her whatever they did, Epinephrine or whatever it was, but that experience felt like she was being blown up like a straw was in her body. The patient inquired with these different physicians about told them about her experience from years ago, and what their suggestion would be, and they told the patient to go for it with getting the COVID vaccine, because it anything were to happen, it would be within 15 minutes of getting the shot, but the patient&#39;s was more than 15 minutes after getting it. The patient got the hives to the horse flies, it was usually within 24 hours. The patient did take an EPIPen with her when she went to get the COVID vaccine, because she was concerned she would have a reaction, but did not end up needing to use it. The outcome of the events was recovered.

The fatigue is their primary concern, as this is so profound she will fall asleep on the toilet or even in the middle of getting dressed.  Appetite is decreased, but she denies N/V/D.  She feels &#34;chilled&#34;, but no known fevers, no rigors/sweats.  Cough is occasionally productive of sputum, mostly clear but sometimes with small &#34;chunks&#34;; no hemoptysis.  No LE edema.  No HA or changes in taste/smell.  No known sick contacts, but patient has exposure to multiple daughters who help care for her, and she has been attending church recently.  Urine is dark/strong, but she denies dysuria.   Pt has received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine, second dose on 3/17/21.   Hospital Course:    Patient was admitted to medical floor for COVID-19 infection and urinary tract infection.  Patient had a very mild course of illness.  Decadron was started but patient did not require any remdesivir.  Patient has remained at her seen home oxygen requirement.  Patient was seen by PT and OT services for generalized weakness.  Blood cultures have been negative.  Patient is medically stable for discharge home today.  She will need another 2 days of antibiotics treatment for urinary tract infection.  Since her respiratory status has been very stable, we have chosen to discontinue the use of Decadron upon discharge to avoid any changes in mental status induced by steroids in an elderly patient.  Home health services and remote monitoring kit have been ordered at the time of discharge.   I have called patient&#39;s daughter  to provide update that patient is coming home today and answered her questions

She seemed tired or having clarity and they did not know what was going on with her.  She has never been one to express how she feels.  She had ambulation difficulties and needed  help getting out of bed or walking.  She would hardly eat or drink water.  This got progressively worse.  They had to fine methods and ways to help her stand up and get her moving to go the restroom.  She has improved.  She was taken to an orthopedist and she has problems with her legs and knees arthritis.  She did get a cortisone shot on 4/13/21 in both knees.  They did not find anything wrong with her hips.  Eventually the symptoms did go away and is almost back to normal.  They had to get a lift chair to stand her up so she would not have to use her strength in her legs to stand up.  She is now back to eating and drinking like she was.  It took 2 1/2 weeks for her to recover from this.

This 89-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number PFREL1283, Expiration Date 30Apr2021), via intramuscular, on 15Jan2021 (at 12:00) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included ongoing lymphoedema (she gets water in her legs), ongoing severe arthritis of both knee caps (she had a cortisone shot and lidocaine in her knees), and dust allergy. Historical vaccine included flu vaccine received in Jan2020 and in Oct2020 (with terrible reaction: pain in arm, numb in arm and muscle pain arm for 6 weeks). Past drug history included allergy to lidocaine (her face swelled up), and hydrocortisone (CORTISONE). She was in a wheelchair. Surgical history included 2 hip replacements. Relevant concomitant medications included drug for lymphoedema. The patient stated she started having side effects almost immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. She felt very panicky, felt very weak, felt very tired. She had like a headache. Some of the symptoms started the day she got the shot and then more symptoms arose the day after. She was very tired and was sleeping a lot the next day. She felt very like groggy. In fact, she was so groggy, she pressed the wrong button in her chair. She clarified she has lymphedema and she has to be in a lift chair to keep her legs elevated. When she needs to get up, she presses a certain button to raise and lift the chair into a sitting position. However, that day, her doorbell rang (her meals are delivered to her) and she was so groggy and confused, that she pressed the button that put her straight out into a lying position instead of a sitting position. She ended up sliding off the chair and onto the floor. She had to call for assistance (there is an emergency button she can press). She had to be lifted off the floor. She explained to them she didn&#39;t end up on the floor from walking, she slid off the chair. She was so disoriented she pressed the wrong button. She felt like she had the flu, she was cold, she had the chills. She was laying down, covered up with 2 blankets. She couldn&#39;t move. It was terrible. At the time, she slid off the chair, she had to go the bathroom. She is on a water pill which makes things worse, but she has a bedside commode close to her lift chair. When she was trying to get off the chair go to the bathroom (which is only 4 or 5 steps away from the commode), she was so disoriented, she pressed the wrong button. She has had this chair for 5 years.  She slid off the chair and ended up hitting the floor with her rear end. She remained on the nice cold floor (its a ceramic tile floor) until they came to pick her up. She mentioned she has had 2 hip replacements and once she is on the floor, she can&#39;t get up. Once assistance from where she lives came to pick her up, she was asked if she need to go the hospital or call ambulance. She explained to them she didn&#39;t fall. She slid off the chair. She is a very active person. Although she is almost 90, year is not senile. She slid off the chair, she didn&#39;t fall. The patient stated that she got the flu shot this past October and had a terrible reaction to that, too. Therefore, she doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her system. She has had a flu shot every single year for the past 10-15 years and she has never had a reaction at all. She received the regular flu shot at her doctor&#39;s office in Oct2020 had a terrible reaction, she had severe pain in her arm where they gave her the shot, the pain wasn&#39;t at the injection site, the shot was high up the arm, her arm was numb and she couldn&#39;t raise it; she had muscle problems with the arm, she had trouble with her arm for 6 weeks. She has been taking naproxen sodium (ALEVE) for the headache. She has just been treating it symptomatically. No fever and she has just felt cold. The patient stated she really is not sick. She went to pick up dog medicine from the vet and when she leaves her facility, her temperature is always checked when she comes back. She was told her temperature was 97 something. So, she wasn&#39;t running any temperature prior to the vaccine. The patient was planned for the second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient stated her symptoms are not so severe it affects her breathing or something serious. It&#39;s just a pain in her neck to walk around with a headache. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number and expiration date unknown, first dose, intramuscular on 26Jan2021 at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included mastectomy, surgery for metaplastic carcinoma. She received 4 units of blood and reacted to the blood and itched from her head to toe and they treated her with prednisone for that. She said that the metaplastic carcinoma was 10 inches big and half of her front was removed. Other medical history and past drugs included allergic to Bactrim, Sulfa drugs, Cortisone, Zocor, Keflex, Macrodantin, Penicillin, Vicodin (took three times and thought she was going to die; coughed for a year and couldn&#39;t even sleep because she developed Pericarditis), Benazepril, Levaquin, Losartan, Niaspan (whole body turned red), Pravastatin. On 07Jan2021, she had an appointment with her doctor who first advised her not to take the vaccine because of all of her allergies but she said there is an antidote if she has a reaction so she said she could take it. She had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Jan2021 and had a bad reaction. She was very dizzy and got sick. They didn&#39;t catch it at the vaccination site because they only had the patients wait 15 minutes. Her drive home takes 10-15 minutes. She thought she couldn&#39;t drive home because of the dizziness. She got a tightness in her chest and started getting so dizzy that she ran into the living room and slept on the sofa because she couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. It was reported that she passed out from about 12:00-15:00. She was completely out. She took a Tylenol right after the shot for dizziness and sick because when she told her healthcare professional about the symptoms, she said to take a Tylenol. She also had shortness of breath on 27Jan2021. This morning (28Jan2021) she had a headache but she was feeling much better. The caller asked if she should get the second dose due to her reaction. The patient stated she has a whole list of allergies that she gave the other agent. The patient stated that she doesn&#39;t think she will take the second shot. She also stated she takes Tylenol after the Flu shot so she doesn&#39;t get so sick. The patient mentioned that her physician does not know about any of this and said that she received the vaccine at a hospital. She said that she only contacted her doctor to notify her that she was dizzy. She was directed to take Tylenol. She said that she did take Tylenol as directed by the people administering the vaccines too and she did get sick. The patient said that it helped a little and she knows that it was not the Tylenol that caused this. She does not want to get the second shot if she gets sick like this. The patient said that the fact sheet said to call 911. The shot did not hurt her at all, and she did not know that she even received it. She said that the person who administered the vaccine was very good. The outcome of the event headache was recovering, dizziness, shortness of breath recovered on 27Jan2021, Tightness in her chest, passed out was recovered on 26Jan2021 and sick was unknown.

He called 911 and the firemen helped me sit up.  I was cold and clammy, but could talk and answer all questions.  The firemen said I should be all right and they left.  They said they had had extra calls for the same symptoms.  I went to bed, and my blood pressure was 93/53.  I slept all right.  The next day, yesterday, I was tired but feeling all right with the highest temp of 98.4.  Today, February 25, I am doing better.  I called and left a message for Dr.

                                                right arm is sore; Fever; tired; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).  An 89-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Batch/lot # EM9809, Exp date 30Jun2021) intramuscular at single dose in right upper arm on 11Feb2021 16:24 for Covid-19 immunisation, administered at hospital.  Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ongoing arthritis both diagnosed about 5 or 6 years before, covid-19 and pneumonia in Nov2020 and she was in the hospital from 04Nov2020 to 09Nov2020, she was hard of hearing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks), aside the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot: EL9261, Exp date 31May2021) intramuscular at single dose in right upper arm on 21Jan2021 16:24 for Covid-19 immunisation. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No events occurred following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced right arm is sore, fever, tired on 12Feb2021. The events were considered medically significant. No event required a visit to Emergency Room or physician. No relevant test done. Course of events as follows: Her arm was sore. Sore arm started on 12Feb2021 morning. She has arthritis and stated maybe this had something to with the soreness in upper right arm, near shoulder, where the vaccine was administered about an inch below her shoulder. Soreness was just there, it hurt. She was very tired and running a temperature of 100.4. She noticed the fever when she got up on 12Feb2021 morning, it was only 99.3 or 99 something, in afternoon it was 100.4. She did not like the fever. She took of paracetamol (TYLENOL 500mg, Lot: 9HV1619, Expiration date May2021) 1000mg twice and it did not really take her fever down. The outcome of events was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events right arm is sore, fever, tired were related to the BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, a acausal relationship between events right arm is sore, fever and tiredness and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

An 89-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 04Feb2021 at 89-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included macular degeneration from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3249; left arm) for COVID-19 immunization on an unknown date.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: shivering (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, tiredness (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, fever (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, shrunk a little bit (non-serious) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, really hot (non-serious) on 10Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: highest her temperature got was 100 on an unspecified date. About six days after the patient had her second COVID shot, the patient experienced shivering and tiredness. It was reported that the patient had shrunk a little bit starting on an unspecified date.  At the time of the report, over the last 3 days, the patient experienced the side effects. &#34;It could be from something else. She could have gotten something. She did not know.&#34; The patient also had a fever a few times. The patient would go between shivering and really hot so she would take her temperature. The patient did not normally have a fever. When the shivering came on, she was trying to cook, and could not hold the spoon in her hand. The patient did not know what was wrong, but she was cold. All she wanted to do was sleep. The only symptom she still had was being tired. The night before the report, the patient woke up so warm and was sweating; her pajamas were damp. The patient could not sleep in them, so she had to go change. The patient has not shivered since then. The tiredness was persisting. The patient slept on and off all day today, but she was feeling better in general. The patient took her temperature every day. &#34;The highest her temperature got was 100.&#34;

A 89-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 28Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9265) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included A Fib, the patient had a light stroke in Apr a year ago, and she was put on another medication that did not agree with her. But caller has been on Eliquis for over a year now. Her eyes are so bad that she does not read a lot. She has allergies, and the 1 degree fever is normal with her allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for blood disorder from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metoprolol (METOPROLOL) taken for atrial fibrillation from an unspecified start date and ongoing; losartan potassium (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM) taken for blood pressure abnormal from an unspecified start date and ongoing; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had been on this product for years, more than two years for her heart, for the A Fib. She has been on Losartan potassium for years. The patient stated she is 89 years old, received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 28Jan2021. She said she didn&#39;t read the Fact Sheet until last night and went through the list of side effects of the vaccine. She explained that on Friday and Saturday, her &#39;nose ran all day and night too&#39; of a &#39;clear liquid&#39;. She added she had a sore throat. She said she had no fever or chills but had a temperature at &#39;98.3&#39;, which is a fever for [her]&#39; because &#39;at 97 that&#39;s [her] normal&#39;. She added she &#39;developed a dry cough, not an allergy cough like having mucus in [her] throat&#39;. She pursued saying she &#39;doesn&#39;t know about the shortness of breath&#39; and sometimes she &#39;feels a little tired&#39; but isn&#39;t sure if it&#39;s related to the vaccine, due to her age. She said regarding headaches, she thinks it was &#39;not a bad headache&#39; because &#39;[she] remembers putting something on her head&#39;. She added she &#39;had some congestions so [she] took an allergy pill&#39;. She lastly described she had &#39;trouble sometimes with nausea&#39; but did &#39;not vomit&#39; and had no &#39;diarrhea&#39;. She then said she is concerned with her &#39;clear runny nose&#39; and her &#39;dry cough&#39;, which she also qualified as &#39;out of the ordinary&#39;. She then mentioned that last night, her room was &#39;too cold&#39; and therefore she had a &#39;scratchy throat and the sinuses came&#39;; she said she took a sinus pill. She asked if it is normal to experience a &#39;clear runny nose&#39; and &#39;dry cough&#39; after the receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine. Caller asked if she should receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine after her reaction to the first dose. Caller explained that while having her symptoms she was exposed to her son who will get married &#34;on the 28th&#34;. She expressed her concern on potentially being infected with COVID and its impact on her son. She asked if you can get COVID from the COVID-19 vaccine. She also asked if she should get tested for COVID given her experience. Caller had her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan2021. By Friday night, caller had a dry cough, was tired, had a little headache, and a runny nose. Caller is wondering if she had a light case of COVID but caller is hesitant to leave her home to go to the doctor&#39;s office for a test because of the cold weather. Caller had her first COVID vaccine on 28Jan2021 at pharmacy and caller stated that the Pharmacist said that she might gets chills and kind of like a fever, but caller did not get that. But, caller states that a couple of days after receiving the vaccine, caller looked at the facts sheet that had been given to her. Caller states that she didn&#39;t previously read the facts sheet, until last night, as her eyes are so bad that she does not read a lot. Caller states that she has had a 1 degree fever, but she has allergies, and the 1 degree fever is normal with her allergies. Caller states that her fever is 98.3, so it is not considered a fever really, but she normally runs 97 degrees. Then caller states that few nights ago, Friday night maybe, she got a dry cough, no mucus, just a dry cough, and she coughed for a couple hours but she was in bed, as it was nighttime. Caller states that she was also tired for a few days, as she is 89 years old. But caller states that she is in reasonably good health, and she lives alone and takes care of herself. So caller just had the tiredness and had a little headache, but she did not lose her taste or smell. Caller states that she had a sore throat, and some congestion, and her nose ran for two days. Caller states that her nose was running like clear water for two days, and then it just stopped. Caller states that it is cold and the weather is bad where she is, so she thinks her allergies are acting up again. Caller states that she is wondering if she had a light case of the virus and overcame it, or she is seeking advice about if it would be necessary for her to go out and get tested. Caller states that she can&#39;t tell if she got the virus or not, and she does not want to drive and go out in the cold to see her doctor. Caller states that a telehealth appointment is not possible because she got a new laptop but she does not like it, so the laptop is all wrapped up and set aside ready to be returned to (courier name). Caller states that she has two sons who could come over to help her with a telehealth appointment but she does not want them to get COVID, if that is what she has. Caller states that she is also concerned because her granddaughter is getting married on the 26th, and she does not want to give anyone COVID. Caller states that the symptom that really got her was that she had clear water running from her nose for two day and then just stopped, as the caller does not get this symptom with her allergies. Caller also has the sore throat. Caller is wondering if these could have been a side effect from the vaccine. But to be honest, caller thinks that what she has now, she is pretty sure is just her usual allergies. Caller states that she has just been staying home so that she would not get the virus, and so far so good. Caller just keeps herself busy around the house. Caller had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Caller states that she has A Fib, but she has not been to her doctor in over a year because of the Virus she has not gone out. But caller states that she has not felt bad or anything, she just has not kept up with her yearly visit. No Investigation Assessment. Outcome of the event nose ran all day and night too of a clear liquid was recovered and outcome of all other events was unknown.

At about day 4-5 after second vaccine, she became more fatigued than usual, developed a mucousy cough, and had little interest in doing anything.  After day 10, a nurse came in and took vitals and suggested she see a physician for possible fluid in lungs and an irregular heart beat.  Monday, April 12 we took her to Urgent care as her Dr. couldn&#39;t see her until we went there first.  We will do a follow up with her regular physician next week.
