This 60-year-old female nurse (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 to 23Dec2020 at 0.3 mL single on left deltoid to prevent getting the COVID vaccine, for protection. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed in her mid twenties, in the 80s, she had asthma when she was a child, then it stopped and resurfaced in her mid twenties, ongoing eczema diagnosed years already, a long time ago and unspecified allergies with medications.

Her side effects were some swelling of arm, a rash developed, like 5cm x 4cm at site of injection, chills and shivers, and a bronchospasm cough on 24Dec2020. Arm swelling event started 24 hours later, no more, it was stable for 24 hours, and the 3rd day, went down, was a little raised, the next day was flat but still red. She had recovered completely.

She was still able to go to work. Chills and shivers started 24 hours later, and took for 48 hours intermittently, she had since recovered completely. The patient stated this was all nothing different than getting like the flu shot.

She had recovered completely. The patient stated she had no symptoms at all before the vaccine, she was healthy, she made sure nothing was going on, that she was not tired, had no cold, she took no medications for this, as she wanted to know how her body reacted and if it can handle it. They says it was ok to take paracetamol (TYLENOL), but she did not, but the second dose she would, now that she knows and she was comfortable through it. She did have some mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores that came up in Dec2020, but nothing to run to the hospital to the doctor for. Clarifies this occured after she received the vaccine. The outcome of the event allergies, mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores were unknown. The outcome of rash at site of injection was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of other events was recovered in Dec2020.

This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Swelling was the size of large lemon.  Smaller amount of swelling noticed in right armpit, also.  Vaccinations had both been done in my LEFT arm and greater swelling was in left armpit.  Had fever, chills and headache this same day requiring me to take round the clock doses of Tylenol.  By the following day, fever and chills were gone but swelling of armpit still present.  Swelling is slowly diminishing but still present by day 3, as I send this notification.

Weakness, fatigue and increased fever continued thru the night and not able to sleep, very restless.  The next morning after I had more weakness and major flair up with my MS, where I fell several times and was not able to get myself off the floor.  Each time I fell it too approximately 20 minutes for me to get either in bed or a chair.  Still had fever of a 100-101 through out  the day, took ibuprofen to help, which it did for a short time but then fever was back.  About 7pm I took some Benadryl  and was finally able to fall asleep.  The next morning, no fever but very weak.  Went to health club to help with my legs.  This day was ok, weak but improved.  No falls

                                                Ringing in ears; Triggered to migraine; Cannot hear, Sounded like everything was muffled; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 14:56 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hypertension, previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic.  Concomitant medication included nifedipine, carvedilol.  Consumer stated, &#34;About 15 minutes into after getting the injection, I was sitting to the site they asked me to stay longer because I previously had an allergic reaction to just one antibiotic (Unspecified Medication).So that was within the 15 minute mark I started getting ringing in my ears and at the 20 mark I had migraine. I had them since I was about 9, they were diagnosed, it triggered a migraine. Although the ringing had gotten better in the last year but it is really bad in the right and it is now causing me (incomplete sentence).&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;I am probably say like I am yelling at you. I cannot hear and my son keeps telling me mom you are yelling. I did not see that I am &#39;ringing to your sheath&#39; ringing in the ear, the headache. I just see my headache is better today. I had a little bit of it but nothing you know Excedrin or something would take care of not enough for me to go take that but it is the ringing and I cannot hear out of that ear. I put my phone up and ringed up. Consumer stated, &#34;Recently my mom had COVID (further not clarified), I barely heard it. On the 23rd of Dec and I keep in contact with my family,they are 13 of us and I picked up the phone and instinctively put it to my right ear, I could not hear and I kept looking at the phone and I thought wait a minute and I put it to my left seems to be okay. It is the right I cannot hear.&#34;  Consumer further added, &#34;I am a Nurse so you expect this, that is why I waited this long because I got the injection at like 3 O&#39;clock yesterday and I waited even longer thinking maybe it will just go away and So I know you guys want to know everything that is going on. So I said wise better to call.&#34; Date of vaccination: Consumer stated, &#34;04Jan2021 (Clarified as 04Jan2021) and the time was 2:56 PM.&#34; Consumer further added, &#34;It is the only thing I could think of. It is the only thing that I could think of that I did differently out of my daily habits to go get this injection. I would say within 15 minutes it just started turning my head and I was like wait a minute I am having ringing and then they had music playing above our head, it sounded like everything was muffled then I turn my head to the right I could hear better and they kept turning my head and one of the administrators at the table started looking at me so I get up and I said you know what I am having ringing in my ear so they had me seated there a bit longer.&#34; Dose and route of administration: Consumer stated, &#34;I think she pulled up one cc that I saw and I got it in my left deltoid.&#34; Treatment: Consumer stated, &#34;No.&#34; Causality: Consumer stated, &#34;I would have to say because it  started like say in the 15 minute mark and then the headache came in about 20 minute mark.&#34; The outcome of the event Headache was resolved while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

Around 2AM in the morning I had high fever, chills, and a very bad headache, and shooting pain like a shock in legs and arms (I had the same when had covid around 04/2020 and was out of work until June 2020 - I developed double pneumonia). It lasted until 11AM the next day. Got a covid test around noon and it was negative and on the 25th I started feeling better.  Got second dose on 01/13/2021 had the same symptoms but not as severe.

The pain in my arm woke me up. I never felt like I fell asleep. I woke up at 530am and took my Thyroid medicine and went back to bed until 6:30am. Felt fine until about 830am. I noticed I was starting to feel lightheaded and had this pressure on my head. I went back to bed and tried to fall asleep but really never did. I noticed that I would lose track of my train of thought often. Got up at 11am and  took a shower and still just didn&#39;t feel like I had any motivation to do anything, so rested again. I then noticed my face, ear lopes and cheeks felt a little numb. I would pinch them and I noticed they were numb. Also, there was still pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose. Still light headed. I layed in bed until about 3pm when I did notice the numbness going away and the pressure on the back of my head and on the bridge of my nose getting a little better. Also, no appetite.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on the arm left on 05Jan2021 around 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient used to get legs cramps when she was pregnant with her twins, but it was only one leg. The patient stated she delivered six children, was in car accidents, and had surgeries. And the patient stated the pain from the COVID-19 Vaccine was beyond any other pain she has experienced. The patient needed glasses to read patient card. And stated her eyesight was going. The patient was pretty healthy. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. And the patient did not receive additional vaccines on same date that administered BNT162B2. The patient experienced deaf and couldn&#39;t hear on 06Jan2021 09:00, leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out on 05Jan2021 19:00, dizzy on 05Jan2021, nauseous on 05Jan2021, threw up twice on 05Jan2021, things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 09:00, pain through whole body and tremoring on 06Jan2021 10:00, bruise at injection site on Jan2021. All the events (except for event bruise at injection site) were reported as seriousness as life threatening. Clinical course: the patient worked nightshift. Laid down that afternoon to take a nap and got up around 10:00. Around 05Jan2021 19:00 PM had sever leg cramps in both legs where her toes were curled out. Leg cramps after vaccine wouldn&#39;t go away and it was in both legs. Just wouldn&#39;t go away. Around 05Jan2021 21:00 PM it went away. The patient was dizzy, nauseous, and threw up twice on the night of 05Jan2021, and going into 06Jan2021. The patient went to the couch in the hotel room and started going deaf. She couldn&#39;t hear anything on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Things started looking funny on 06Jan2021 around 09: 00 AM. Woke up at 09:35. Hour after that there was pain through her whole body and everything was hurting at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. The patient was tremoring at 10:00 AM on 06Jan2021. Couldn&#39;t reach the phone to dial 9-11. Thought she was going to die. Last until about noon and then started to go away. Doesn&#39;t know if it is safe to take the second vaccine. Doesn&#39;t know if these are thing that should have happened to her. She started to get real concerned. Went into hotel room and started feeling dizzy again. Stopped haring things. Funny feeling in her ears. Was seeing things, got dizzy, and everything got dark. Everything lasted until 12:00 PM on 06Jan2021. Everything was good now. The patient had a bruise where injection was in Jan2021. Stated it was nothing compared to what she went through. Woke up around 10:00 AM. Then went back to sleep and got up around 18:00 PM. She felt fine. Her whole body was sore from the muscle spasming. The outcome of the event bruise at injection site was unknown, of the event leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out was recovered around 05Jan2021 21:00, the outcome of other remain events was recovered on 06Jan2021 12:00.  The reporter considered (method of assessment: Global Introspection) that all the events were related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: All the reported events were possibly related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship. However, it is worth noting that the 60-year-old female patient had car accidents history and had surgeries. All the events started when she worked nightshift, including leg cramps in both legs and toes curled out, nauseous, threw up twice, pain through whole body, tremoring and transient deafness. Patient did not get rest after vaccination may a risk factor to the onset of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130.

She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears. She woke up about 3:30 with it. The headache now was all over head from front to back and comes and goes. Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches. After the first one, it took 10 hours for the shivering to start. This time it was very similar. The shivering started about 10 hours later, at 9pm on 11Jan2021. Back pain starting at 05:00 on 12Jan2021 was stated as being sharp on right side scapula and feel like the flu. It is to the right of spinal vertebrae. She thought she would go to bed and lie down. She has had back pain before. The jaw pain started around 05:00 on 12Jan2021. She felt it in her cheek. It was a little bit better. Nausea started at 11:00 pm on 11Jan2021 and got worse at 03:30 when she got up to go to the bathroom around midnight. She felt like she could vomit and felt better, but she couldn&#39;t. Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot. Calves were sore in back and felt like a DVT (Deep vein thrombosis), started at 03:30 of 12Jan2021 and was still sore. She said she sound like a hypochondriac. It was in back of calf towards knee. She did not think it was a blood clot. It was feeling better. It was still sore but nothing like it was at 03:30. It is just an odd pain. She did not want to leave the house and surprised that her oxygen saturation was low. She just wanted to go back to sleep for a bit. Oxygen Saturation dropping was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Chest pressure, Heart rate 130&#39;s, Headache/head felt like it would explode, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, calf pain/Calves were sore in back and Calves were sore in back and felt like DVT  was recovering. The outcome of events Oxygen Saturation dropping, Ringing in the ears, Shivering, Back pain/pain in her back, Nausea, and Thighs are burning was not recovered. The outcome of events Temperature 101.7, she sound like a hypochondriac, dry hives, flu like symptoms, weak, felt miserable and can barely walk was unknown.

Nothing concerning, just more curious. With second vaccine, developed chills within one hour and went to bed.

After one week, only have occasional chest discomfort. Arrhythmia has returned to baseline occasional PVC. No further chills, headache, nausea or other pains.

A 60-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper left arm on 12Jan2021 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient reported that she took it yesterday and an hour into it she started having a burning sensation in her chest. What happen next, around 8pm, she started having allergy like symptoms that lasted throughout the night. She was experiencing nose running, congested and blockage in her nose, and shortness of breath. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. For treatment, she took Mucinex tablets for allergy. She couldn&#39;t sleep during the night until this morning. She had to breathe through her mouth because she couldn&#39;t&#39; breathe through her mouth. This was the first dose, her second dose is due on 02Feb2020 and she wants to know if she can skip it.   Before she got it she contacted her primary care due to having allergies before the vaccine and asked if she should take; she was told to hold on but then she went ahead and took it. Within the first 30 minutes she was ok but in an hour is when she had the burning sensation in her chest. The burning sensation lasted about an hour. The dose was administered around 4pm on 12Jan2021.The caller reports that the Mucinex and she has breathing treatment, nebulizer treatments for her lungs, that she did and these things helped. Early this morning she felt she can now close her mouth and breathe normally. It was administered in the upper left arm. She did not require a visit to the doctor or ER. The patient has had no reactions to vaccines in the past nor were any administered on the day of or within the prior 4 weeks. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of allergy like symptoms, congested and blockage in her nose and shortness of breath which included Mucinex. The patient recovered from burning sensation in her chest on 12Jan2021, from allergy like symptoms/allergy and shortness of breath on 13Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative.

                                                Woke up during the night with chills that had my body shivering and a headache.  Did  not get up until morning because I didn&#39;t want to get out of the covers even though I was cold.  Took some ibuprofen which helped with both the chills and headache.  I had no energy and was very tired.  I slept most of the day and woke up to go to the bathroom and take more ibuprofen.  Towards the evening I could tell that I was feeling a bit better.  I was able to take a bath, more ibuprofen and went to bed.  Slept pretty well.  Woke up once and took ibuprofen because of headache and body aches.  Felt much better on Sunday.  Was still tired and slept a good part of the day.  My arm continues to ache, but is not really painful unless I try to lift it.

Thursday night I woke up in the middle of the night to the feeling of not being able to breathe. I laid awake for a while but dosed back off and it happened again a little later.   It felt as if someone was sitting on my chest which prompted me to go to the ER the next day.  Various test were done and I was admitted in the hospital for further observation. After admission I developed a massive headache which lasted from that Friday afternoon until that Sunday.  I was released on that Sat and the symptoms seemed to be getting better and by that Sunday evening all symptoms had subsided.

                                                congestion in the throat and upper lungs; congestion in the throat and upper lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on the left arm on 21Dec2020 09:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included herpes 2. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 26Dec2020 09:00, the patient experienced congestion in the throat and upper lungs. Oxygen level was 98 and temperature was 97.7. She had a good diet, no dairy, and no Christmas junk food, so for the patient, it was inexplicable. She was also consistent at mask wearing and all the precautions. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal gap between the vaccination and the event onset, the Company considers the event pulmonary congestion is unlikely related to vaccination with BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A contactable other HCP (Patient) reported for a 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot: EK92331), intramuscular at left arm on 04Jan2021 (approximately between 18:15-18:30) at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included supplements. The patient experienced soreness and swelling at injection site, malaise and feels tired on 05Jan2021 08:00. She was scheduled for second dose a day later for COVID vaccine so after the 21 days to get her second dose. Patient is a Dental Hygienist. She received the first dose on 04Jan2021 and is scheduled to receive second dose on 26Jan2021. She should have it scheduled for 25Jan2021. There is no prescriber. She received it at a local hospital through her employer. They did not offer her the 25Jan2020, and said next day is 26 days. They told her there would not be any problem being a day late. She called back with a concern and had evening appointment with the intention of being 3 weeks later. She did it while she had 2 days off work in case she had a reaction. She was told it was not a big deal to get it 1 days later. She asked if she could go to a different location and they told her no, it had to come from the same batch and lot to receive second dose. She is just concerned about doing it a day before she has to go back to work because there are worse side effects with second dose. There is a 4 day grace period from what she read of of 17-21 days and not over 21 days. She is not sure if that is true though. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

I also started feeling lightheaded like I might faint. I pull over into a parking lot and had a family member come get me to drive me home. I was extremely thirsty and drank a lot of water at home. Eventually, my redness went away and my face did not feel as hot.  I did feel other more typical symptoms too such as painful arm, and flu like symptoms. I am mainly concerned about the reaction I had when driving home since it was similar to what happens when I take cortisone or Doxycycline.  I am needing information as to whether it is safe for me to take my second dose of the covid vaccine.

                                                Headache/headache got worse and worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported similar events for two patients (herself and co-worker). This is the first of two reports. A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date: unknown), intramuscular, on 06Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was also reported that she received the vaccine at a military facility. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of bnt162b2. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed about a month ago (Dec2020) and ongoing, and glaucoma from an unspecified date (diagnosed when she was 15 years old) and ongoing. Concomitant medications included losartan (Manufacturer: Lupin, 50 mg tablet) for high blood pressure, venlafaxine ER (Manufacturer: Aurobindo, 150 mg Prolonged-release capsule) as anti-depressant, latanoprost (Manufacturer: Sandoz, 0.005 %) for glaucoma, and brimonidine tartrate, timolol maleate (COMBIGAN, Manufacturer: Allergan) for glaucoma; all were from unspecified dates and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number: EH9699), intramuscular, on 19Dec2020 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization; there was no adverse event following this vaccination. The patient experienced headache on 06Jan2021 at 11:45 am (As reported, pending clarification). The patient reported that she did not have anything with the first dose. She got the second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 06Jan2021 at 13:30. She started getting headache at 11:45 am (as reported) but she didn&#39;t think much of it. On 07Jan2021, she had a headache and she took two Tylenol and then went to sleep. She woke up around midnight that night and her headache got a little bit worse, so she took two Tylenol again and fell asleep. In the morning of 08Jan2021, around 2:30 am her headache got worse and worse, and she took three Tylenol. Her headache was still there but it was not enough to go to the emergency room or anything. She panicked on Thursday (07Jan2021) since her headache was still there; her headache was still lingering but it was going away. Her headache pain was at 7 out of 10 on an unspecified date. She stated that she was supposed to work at the time of report, but she called out of work due to her headache. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the headache and included treatment with Tylenol 500 mg (lot number: DFE3060A, expiration date: Apr2022). The adverse event did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician office. Outcome of the event was recovering.

This 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EJ1686), via intramuscular, on 06Jan2021 (at 14:30) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Age at vaccination is 61-year-old.  Historical vaccine included Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for immunization; and Shingles vaccine (intramuscular, at single dose) on 15Dec2020 for varicella immunization. Relevant medical history included usual tenderness. No relevant concomitant medications were provided.  On 07Jan2021, she woke up at 2:00 in the morning, she had a high temperature, she was chilled, she had a severe headache, nausea, fatigue, and body aches. She got up and took ibuprofen (ADVIL). She was basically in bed, she had to cancel all her appointments in the morning, she just laid in bed and the following afternoon her fever broke at about 4:30 in the afternoon then she just had a low grade temperature and a dull headache, nausea through the next day, Friday the 08Jan2021. She still has a very dull headache and just not right, kind of like a flu bug. She had no fever; she had not had any fever after Friday afternoon or Saturday. Fever started at 2 in the morning 07Jan2021 and she experienced the chills until after fever broke. Fever went above 102 degrees. She still had a little of the nausea, she just didn&#39;t feel like eating. She still had the dull headache. The nausea and headache have improved when compared to how it was on the 07Jan2021. She was back to work now she just has a dull frontal headache. The reporting nurse assessed all the events, except of &#39;Doesn&#39;t feel like eating&#39;, serious for disability. She stated she may have had usual tenderness but nothing like this. The patient had recovered from the event fever on 08Jan2021 and from the event &#39;chills/chilled&#39; on 07Jan2021; the patient was recovering from &#39;nausea&#39; and &#39;severe Headache/Dull headache/Frontal headache&#39;, while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  It is worth noting that patient had other vaccines not far ago, including Diphtheria and Tetanus vaccine and Shingles vaccine on 15Dec2020 for immunization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                After waiting 15 mins  I developed a dry throat and walked to my car (8-10 mins later). Began to develop difficulty swallowing by the time I reached my car.  Waited a few minutes and it did not abate and continued worsen,. Went to hospital&#39;s ER and was seen by Dr. At that time, my voice had become coarse and gravely. Was given oral steroid and a Benadryl.  Symptoms lessened a bit and were gone after about 2 hours. While at first I thought my breathing wasn&#39;t affected, after symptoms cleared, I realized that my breathing was easier. Symptoms did not reoccur.

                                                I had an immediate reaction to the covid vaccine within 30 seconds after the injection.  I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

Had I been driving, this would likely have caused an accident.  This is the first time I have ever experienced this feeling.  There were 2 or 3 other episodes of feeling like I was falling.  2 of this happened while lying down.  They were sudden sensations that made me gasp.  Spent most of 1 week in bed with fatigue, vertigo, and 2 times vomiting.  Vomiting occurred day 2 post vaccine.  Fatigue was continuous for about a week.  At day 16 now, certain movements still illicit vertigo.  All vertigo symptoms have lasted under 1 minute. However, some have been back to back, such as after repositioning multiple times in bed.  Ears have felt very full for almost 2 weeks.  Certain head positions or movements, still illicit sensations of the room moving.  There was no specific headache, but my head did not feel good for about 2 weeks.  There was no fever, but there was chilling one night, a couple of days after the vaccine.  I don&#39;t know if getting 2nd vaccine is wise.

                                                I was at work yesterday morning and began to feel shaky. Progressed to both hands trembling; legs feeling weak and wobbly. Could not perform my work duties. Progressed to Rigors. Lasted at least 3 hrs in it&#39;s severest form. Now, 24 hrs later I still have some hand tremors, and legs are weak. Shoulder, knees, hips achy. I&#39;m very fatigued.  Right arm soreness @ injection site. All events were reported. I was sent home from work, had to be driven home. I rested, slept and hydrated the remainder of the day. Did not go to work today.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (not really diagnosed with COPD), ongoing smoker (smokes about 10 cigarettes a day; has smoked 40&#43; years), cough. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that on 31Dec2020, the patient tested positive for COVID from which she went to the doctor and was treated on 14Jan2021. The patient was given SOLU-MEDROL injection just to help her because she has mild COPD to bring up all of the junk. She is clear now. She doesn&#39;t have pneumonia. Her labs were good. She feels 80% back. The patient also experienced weak and thrush on unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event tested positive for COVID which included antibiotic and a cortisone injection, and for the event thrush which included NYSTATIN mouth rinse. Outcome of the event tested positive for COVID was recovering. Outcome of the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (10 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;tested positive with Covid &#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / COVID-19) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded.

A contactable consumer reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of 2 report.   A 61-year-old female consumer (patient) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Covid Vaccine, lot number: EL1248) on 06Jan2021 at single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. Concomitant drug included Multivitamin, Vitamin C, Vitamin D Zinc all from Mar2020 and ongoing. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EK5730) on 18Dec2020 in the right arm. Patient got COVID vaccine and a few hours later or the next day she started getting a hole in her retina and started losing her site in right eye. she went to the doctor as she has a hole in her retina. Again, this may be totally unrelated but she wanted to call and get this reported. She is going to see a retinal specialist this afternoon. After she had her COVID vaccine she had a bad headache for 3 days. She wore sunglasses in her house because the light bothered her eyes. She noticed this on 16Jan2021 because she was looking at paperwork and her eyes felt dry. She blinked a few times and had opened one eye alone, and she noticed that her left eye was fine but the vision in her right was not. This could have been going on longer. She just never closes only one eye. When both are open, her vision is normal. She saw the eye doctor yesterday, and that is when they said she had a hole in her retina. They said she will have to have surgery to close the hole. She knows she is at the right age for this to spontaneously happen, but just in case it is related, she wanted to report it. Outcome of the event Loss of vision in right eye was Not Recovered, for headache was recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3302, NDC number/expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm (also reported as upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; the patient was a healthcare worker and was trying to protect herself. The vaccination facility type was reported as a drive thru site. Relevant medical history included previous neurological problems, which included history of underlying migraine with paresthesia/chronic paresthesia (ongoing) and tinnitus. The patient had no family medical history relevant to the adverse events (AEs). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no other vaccine received on the same day of the Pfizer suspect or 4 weeks prior. She never had any problems with vaccines in the past. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was reported as none. Initially, the patient was asking if there were any reports of paresthesia, serious neurologic adverse events, tinnitus, hearing loss, or abdominal tightness in the studies for the Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 vaccine. After the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 13Jan2021, she experienced an exacerbation of migraine with paresthesia and tinnitus. She also reported experiencing some abdominal tightness on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient reported she was scheduled for her second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, but had concerns because she was still experiencing tinnitus and it was &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss&#34; on an unspecified date. The patient further reported that she was due for the next dose the following day at the time of the report (03Feb2021). She had previous neurological problems and did not know if this did exacerbate things or not. She had migraines, tinnitus, and paresthesia and was wondering how many other patients with neurological problems reported this and was this a common side effect or adverse event reported. One doctor told her not to get the second dose and another one told her to get it and she wanted to know what she should do. The patient had headaches/migraines on the evening of vaccination on 13Jan2021 that were fairly mild and 3 days after that on 16Jan2021, they got bad and was accompanied with nausea with increased tinnitus. The migraines and nausea had gone, and the chronic paresthesia was the same as she always had, but the tinnitus was a lot louder and worse. The patient also mentioned that her migraines usually go away, but this one had lingered. The AEs did not require any visit to an emergency room or a physician office. There were no investigation assessment. The patient recovered from the event &#34;nausea&#34; on an unspecified date, she was recovering from the event &#34;exacerbation of migraine/ headaches/migraines,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exacerbation of paresthesia and tinnitus/increased tinnitus, while the outcome of the events &#34;almost like she also had some mild hearing loss and some abdominal tightness&#34; was unknown. The reporter assessed the events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; as serious, other medically important conditions. The relatedness of drug to the reactions/events &#34;migraine, tinnitus, paresthesia, and nausea&#34; was unknown as per the reporting pharmacist (Method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: The 61-year-old female had relevant medical history included previous neurological problems. The reported neurological events and partial hearing loss were more likely due to pre-existing conditions, and less likely related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  Event nausea was likely due to the first dose of bnt162b2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Blood pressure high diagnosed a couple years ago. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) for COVID-19 immunization on 29Dec2020 and unspecified flu shot last fall, she thinks in Sep or Oct2020, but she has never had problems with those. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient called and said she had reaction to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 12 hours after her second dose and wanted to report it. She said also this past weekend, on Sunday, on 24Jan2021, she started to develop a localized rash that has like a border to it. She added that she got her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021 at about 01:30 PM in her right arm. She said that she woke up the next morning, 20Jan2021 at 03:00 AM with a high fever, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and rapid heart rate. She said that the high fever that started the temperature she took was 103 initially, she says she took paracetamol (TYLENOL) and it came down to 101, and the next day it was probably 100 most of the day, then it broke that evening. She said the Tylenol, the dose was the extra strength, unknown if it was 500 mg, they were capsules. She says she normally doesn&#39;t keep it around, the in-house nurse suggested it so she went and got a sample thing and took a couple doses, she doesn&#39;t have it with her as she is at work and is not at home. She said that the nausea and vomiting subsided after the first day or second day, she had the on and off fever and slept most of the day both days. She said that she doesn&#39;t have a fever now. She said that she doesn&#39;t have her exact heart rate from when she was having the rapid heart rate, she just felt it in her chest. She added that the only reason she said anything was because she called in sick last week on an unspecified date in Jan2021. She said that the rash started developing after that and it is now probably the size of a 16 oz or 60 oz cup, unable to clarify number with caller, she said that it is definitely big but it doesn&#39;t bother her, though she is concerned it is there. She clarified that it is a couple inches in diameter and kind of looks like the state of (State Name), on her injection arm which was her right arm. She said her arm is not sore now, it was after the shot on an unspecified date in Jan2021, if she pressed where the injection was it is still a little sore. She said that the hospital said to report it. She said she also has a concern if she should she get another shot if they decide this is needed for more than two vaccinations. She said that she knows they are still gathering information at this point, so she thought she should better turn in, hopefully there will be solution later on. The outcome of the events localized rash, dizziness, heart rate increased and sickness was unknown. The outcome of the events fever, nausea and vomiting was recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021 while the outcome of the event vaccination site pain is recovering.

A 61-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm shoulder (as reported) on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, open heart surgery in Aug2017 (for 2 holes in the heart), complete heart valve replacement in Oct2017 and ongoing, &#34;pacemaker&#34; from Oct2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included metoprolol for thyroid condition, amlodipine for high blood pressure, clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN]) for allergies; all from 2017 and ongoing. Patient previously took first dose of BNT16B2 on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization and experienced heart rate increased. She was brought to the emergency room and they gave her an intravenous medication for cardioversion where they stopped her heart and restarted it to get the rhythm back to normal. Family medical history included mother and sister died from lung cancer; father died of pancreatic cancer. Heart rate increased following second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine administered on 29Jan2021; onset of event was in the afternoon on 30Jan2021 while at work. Her heart kind of jumped, skipped a beat and then just took off; she could feel her body twerking. Her heart rate went up to 193 beats per minute. She went to the nurses station at work, they took her blood pressure which was 193-verified this as same number of bpm of heart rate-documented as provided. That nurse told her she should go to the hospital, so patient just left work and walked to the hospital which was a block away from work. She did not feel lightheaded, sick, or pain, just heart racing. She was again seen in the emergency room in response to this event, but was not admitted to the hospital. She was again given an intravenous medication for cardioversion where they stopped her heart and restarted it to get the rhythm back to normal. She does not know the name of the intravenous medication for cardioversion that she was administered. The only thing still ongoing related to this event was that she feels a little lightheaded still. Relevant Tests: All were good. They tested her kidneys, heart did an X-ray, EKG; tested her liver and thyroid and they said everything came back good; They said her heart rhythm was fast, and irregular, but something else was normal-she does not remember what that was. She had no further details or results for testing/investigations to provide at this time. Outcome of increased heart rate was recovered while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the batch number has been requested.

By Friday, I went to my PCP and they noticed that my blood pressure was only 90/58 and they were concerned so she told me that she was calling my cardiologist who said to reduce the dose of my Diltiazem from 180 mg daily to 120 mg daily. She also said to take a few days off of taking the Diltiazem. I have also had a serious increase in Tachycardia. That evening I went to the ED because I was so weak and couldn&#39;t breath well. I am also retaining a lot of fluid. The lab work indicated an elevated Pro-B-Natriuretic Peptide level of 227. I am still not well and each doctor I have spoken to said they believe it is due to the vaccine. I do not know if I should take the second dose.

                                                Had gotten a headache within 1/2 hour of getting the injection. Within 2 hours after receiving the injection my arms started to itch and upper back areas. Within 4 hours I noticed rash like redness with tiny little spots/bumps all up and down both arms and the itching was getting worse with both arms and upper back areas. This went away by Friday evening. I had the headache until the following Monday evening.

                                                I had the 1st Pfiser Covid Vaccine on 12/21/20 and on 12/24/20 I had abdominal pains resulting in diarrhea turning into bright red bleeding by the late morning on 12/25/20. I continued to bleed for hours (only when  cramping) and ended up going to an ED for severe abdominal pain, bleeding, nausea and general weakness. The ED doctor said it was from internal hemorrhoids and the diarrhea and was not sure it was related to the Covid Vaccine and possible being an intestinal flu but I felt like I needed to report.  I also had nausea and vomiting the evening of 12/26/20 lasting about 12 hours. It took me a few days of Zofran and Imodium to get it in control and the bleeding did stop by 12/27/20.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284), intramuscularly in the left arm on 29Dec2020 at 06:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date.  The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergy from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, influenza vaccine (FLU VACCINE) for an immunization on an unspecified date (received within two weeks of vaccination).  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: muscles felt really tightened up and stiff when getting out of bed and throughout the day (worst complaint) (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight nausea/nausea (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight fatigue (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slight headache (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, slightly stiff neck (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 at 07:00 with outcome of not recovered, right arm pain (non-serious) on 30Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, back pain (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, the muscles knot up under her rib cage/muscle tightness (non-serious) in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown.  The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020 at work, and she had been experiencing adverse events since. The worst side effect she was experiencing was muscle tightness. At the time of the report, the patient got up at 09:00, and her &#34;back was killing her.&#34; The patient was achy. The patient would tighten up really tight under both rib cages, and it made her nauseous. The patient had been taking ibuprofen (ADVIL) and ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN since she received the vaccination. The patient received the vaccine in her left arm, but her right arm hurt the next day. The next day after that (30Dec2020) she woke up and the right side of her back around the kidney area hurt. It was the right side lumbar. The next morning after that, &#34;her entire back was killing her down the middle of her spine. From her head all the way down.&#34; Since then, it came and went. The patient could not say if it was persisting, improving or worsening for any of the symptoms. &#34;It just grabs her.&#34; The day before the report, the patient thought she was doing better. The patient cleaned the house, and then sat down to eat. The past two nights, it had &#34;hit her really hard during supper time.&#34; Both of her sides of her back would tighten up; &#34;tense up like waiting for an impact before a wreck.&#34; The patient&#39;s back would seize up. The patient could not get comfortable; and would start pacing. Then, she would try to lay down. Last night, it took a half an hour to loosen back up. &#34;It knots up like crazy. It was bad enough, she thought she was going to pass out.&#34; The patient did not know if it was the combination of eating supper or what. The patient thought if she got up that maybe she would feel better. The patient started pacing around. The patient went outside because she thought maybe fresh air would help. When it would tighten up under her rib cage, it made her nauseous. The patient did not know if it was a &#34;vagus nerve thing or what.&#34; The patient was close to throwing up. The muscles knot up under her rib cage. The patient&#39;s back felt like she fell off a horse. It was weird to her that her left arm never bothered her. &#34;Nothing stays the same.&#34; Sometimes it was her entire arm or part of the arm that hurt. Like on top of her forearm. The patient thought she was doing good and then it would come back. When she moved her arm upward, she felt it. The patient said she could deal with the arm pain. It was the knotting up pains that were the worst. The patient tried calling an institute (name withheld) because it happened while eating dinner the other night. The institute (name withheld) &#34;nurse was useless.&#34; The pain was across her sacroiliac area. The patient had been &#34;living on Advil and ibuprofen for her back pain.&#34; The patient had been taking them together. The patient worked nights, and she was planning on going to work the night before the report, but she had to text her boss and tell her she could not come in. The patient was in good health; had perfect blood pressure and her sugar was normal. The patient was not diabetic. The patient&#39;s labs were always normal. The patient was really dreading that second shot. &#34;The flu shot kicked her butt for a couple of days, but this was way worse.&#34; The patient started reading up on the COVID vaccine, and it said usually younger people had severe side effects. That old people have less of a response. The patient did not know why she was experiencing such side effects. At the time of the report, it was day 7 or 8, and she was still feeling bad.  The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

At one point it seemed to settle into my hand. Knuckles swelled arthritis like. When walking up stairs I had significant muscle weakness in my legs and exertional  dyspnea.  Eyes felt &#34;feverish&#34; but had no fever. The next morning while trying to do a routine workout the same thing happened. It was a significant change to my normal condition. The dyspnea was the most concerning. The body aches settled into my lower back. Fatigue was moderate-moderately severe.  As the day went on things waxed and waned.  By the end of 72 hrs. most symptoms subsided. Friday 01/08/2021 I had a completely normal workout, no exertional  dyspnea, fatigue subsided, no body aches. Back to normal. I would consider the symptoms to have been  Moderate&#43;.

Took 2 Ibuprofen and the chills subsided during the night and then had mild/moderate body aches for about another 12 hours. About 48 hours after the injection the top half of my arm is currently slightly swollen, red and hot to the touch.

A 62-year-old female patient started received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for an unspecified indication. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  As reported, patient asked, &#34;should I get the second injection of the COVID-19 vaccine since I have this cough that will not go away?.&#34; This female nurse, who was also the patient, reported receiving her first injection of the PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE on 18Dec2020. She started to develop a cough after the injection that did not improve and had worsened by the end of the second week. Treatment has included cetirizine (ZYRTEC), dextromethorphan (ROBITUSSIN),Guaifenesin (MUCINEX) and albuterol inhaler. A chest x-ray showed some inflammation on the lungs and she was given a steroid inhaler, which has helped. She has received two COVID-19 tests at different time intervals, and both were negative. She was scheduled to receive the second COVID-19 vaccination on Friday but was uncertain if she should receive it given her cough was not improving. She had a bad cough, and other symptoms just before her injection (pending clarification). But her general practitioner (GP) put her in a steroid inhaler. She talked to her GP but can&#39;t give her complete advice as to whether she can still take the 2nd dose or not due to her situation. She said she had very slight pain in her arms after taking the vaccine, and felt a really bad headache on 18Dec2020. She would like to know if she still needs to continue the 2nd dose of vaccine or not since she still has a cough. Patient asked if there was any guidance on getting a second dose and what if test was a false positive and she really did have COVID-19?. Outcome of the event &#34;She started to develop a cough after the injection that did not improve and had worsened by the end of the second week&#34; was  not recovered while &#34;A chest x-ray showed some inflammation on the lungs&#34;, Slight pain in her arms and Bad headache were unknown.   Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                approximately  2 hours after my vaccination, I started with a very severe headache and felt extremely tired. I had difficulty staying awake. I slept about 2 hours. When I woke up my headache was gone and I was no longer tired. I went to bed and slept well until a headache woke me up the next morning however it was not as severe as the previous night. I was a bit lethargic but not too bad.   My headache continued until the evening of 1.11.21 however I was not lethargic and was able to work. Today is 11.12.21 and I feel fine.  I had no injection site discomfort to speak of.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

                                                heart rate of 160; severe nausea; arm soreness; muscle soreness in left arm; general fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 62-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 62 years. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EK5730) administered on 30Dec2020 at 01:00PM and the patient said she did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. The patient received no concomitant medications. She stated that she had no other recent vaccinations or new medications. One thing that may be important is that she did do a 7 day detox that ended the Sunday before her second vaccine dose, so her body was pretty much having no impurities in it, and she has been eating clean since then, maybe having something foreign put into her body set it off after detox. The patient experienced arm soreness and general fatigue on 21Jan2021, and on 22Jan2021 at 01:00 she experienced severe nausea and heart rate of 160 (which was reported serious as medically significant). Patient reported that after her second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine she had a significant side effect that didn&#39;t happen until 10-12 hours after getting the vaccine. She did not have a reaction after the first vaccine. After the second injection her arm was sore, and she had general fatigue. She had the second dose injected Thursday at around 01:00PM, then at one in the morning her heart rate was 160, and she had severe nausea. She was that way until 08:00AM. Her heart rate was 120 probably by 09:00AM, then came down to 100, she has never had anything like that before. Her arm soreness was a deep muscle soreness to her left arm. The fatigue was a couple hours later after she got the second dose of the vaccine. The nausea started at 01:00AM, and lasted until six to eight, she did no treatment, and it improved and is still gone now. For her heart rate of 160, she had no treatment, though she probably should have gone to the hospital, but it came down. She usually runs a heart rate of 60-70, it went back to normal Friday, probably in the afternoon on the 22nd, about 12 hours after that started. The patient stated that she feels this is medically significant for her heart rate to be that high. She had contacted her primary care physician (PCP), but they didn&#39;t call her back for 4-5 hours, by then she was fine. She doesn&#39;t think that this was treated well by her PCP, and that they should have done an electrocardiogram (EKG) and follow up labs, she is changing her PCP as a result of this. She is concerned about the people who will be getting their second dose, she has been helping with these, they have patients that are over 100, they wouldn&#39;t survive that rapid heartbeat. The outcome of arm soreness/muscle soreness and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event of heart rate increased was likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history and concomitant drugs was none. The patient woke up at midnight with severe leg cramps, tried walking it out, collapse and passed out (according to husband). He stated that the patient turned white as a ghost and sweats.  After coming too, drank electrolytes and water. The patient got the chills after sweating.  It took a while for her to warm up and go back to sleep. Event start time was reported as 27Jan2021. The outcome of the event was resolved.

Two days after the vaccine, while at orthopedist (for a Rotator Cuff Surgery), I began to feel dizzy.  I sat down for a few minutes, drank some water, and then resumed my therapy.  After the first set of my 4th exercises I began to get dizzy, I sat down on the PT table, then laid down and fainted for about 1-2 seconds.  My blood pressure plummeted to 60/?. EMT?s and an ambulance were called.  I was given an IV and taken to hospital.  In the ER, my blood pressure elevated to 205/121. (I think that was it.)  I was given a cat scan, ekg, chest X-ray, blood tests, etc.  All tests were normal except a very slight (by one number)  magnesium level.  I was admitted for observation and more tests where performed.  My blood pressure remained high, but I had no more dizziness or syncope.  I was given many more blood tests, imagining, ultrasound of heart, ultrasound of carotid arteries,  ultrasound ?bubble test,? nuclear heart treadmill stress test.  All tests were normal.  The only change in my health that can be attributed to this episode is the Covid vaccine.

Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event cellulitis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2 based on the information provided. The event onset date is not reported, therefore the drug-event temporal relationship is not clear. In addition, the BNT162B2 vaccine was administered in the arm but the reported cellulitis was at knee area. It is very unlikely that the cellulitis was related to BNT162B2.

                                                Approximately 1 hours after injection, I felt an unusual feeling at base of throat. It progressively got worse and I felt throat swelling and my voice was effected. No itchy throat like my anaphylaxis reaction to shellfish only swelling. I mildly panicked and wanted to take Benadryl. About 1/2 hour later by the time I got home reaction was over. No repeat of symptoms ever again.

                                                I have just been fitted for a CPAPand have been using it for 11 days with no ill effects. Last night at roughly 3:15 am I woke up because I was having difficulties breathing. I had trouble on the inhale but the worse part was not being able to exhale with the CPAP on.  I could only exhale through the mouth. I had to take the CPAP off so as I could breath. I also got out of bed to get in a sitting position.  At this point my breathing seemed somewhat ok.  About 30 minutes later I took my blood pressure and pulse.  BP was 123 over 70 and my pulse was 70.

A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date unknown) at the public health department via unspecified route of administration at right arm on 28Dec2020 12:30 as single dose to prevent getting the Covid virus. Medical history included medication allergies (allergic to like 3 to 4 medications), allergic to sulfur/sulfa, allergic to penicillin, allergic to &#34;-mycins&#34;, allergic to dye (for a CT scan). The patient informed that she was given the Pfizer shot, clarified to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Monday (verified to be the 28th). The patient informed that since then she has had a low grade fever and the patient would like to talk to someone to see if that was normal, since it was still not gone. The patient got her first dose of the vaccine injected into her right arm around 12:30 PM Monday (28Dec2020), and her fever started Monday night and got to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and since then she has been running 99.2 degrees Fahrenheit (Dec2020), it was 99.8 degrees Fahrenheit now (30Dec2020). The patient stated &#34;it didn&#39;t say on the vaccine card, but the sheet they gave with it says it is the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. All that is on there is the date she got it, 18Nov2020 and the healthcare girl put her initials on it&#34; (unable to clarify discrepancy between the dates provided as caller continued speaking). The patient informed that she was supposed to have turned around on the 18th to get the second shot (unable to clarify statement and the caller may have meant that she was supposed to get the second dose of the shot on 18Jan2021, and misread the card as she seemed to have difficulty reading the nurse&#39;s handwriting on it). The reporter informed that the LOT number was written with an E and then either a V or a K, it looks like a V but the girl put a leg on there so maybe it was a K then 9231, or EV or 9231 or 9731. The outcome of the event &#34;pyrexia&#34; was not recovered.

Almost all dizziness subsided by day 12 post vaccine. Headaches subsided by day 5.

Upon waking I felt ok but after walk; weakness; felt very poorly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health care professional. A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 04Jan2021 11:45 at single dose at left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis. Concomitant medications included etanercept (ENBREL), and levothyroxine. The patient felt okay right after the injection but about 2 hours later, on 04Jan2021 14:30, she started experiencing a pressure headache, gradually felt very poorly and took a nap for a few hours. Upon waking the patient felt okay but after walking around the house for about 20 minutes, the headache started up again and the same awful feeling of weakness so she laid down and took another 2 hours nap. When the patient woke up the second time she felt as though nothing had happened, was feeling fine. So the patient would say the side effects lasted for about 5 hours. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Jan2021 17:00.

                                                within 24 hours vaccination shots, I had intermittent low grade fever, constant chills, and mild VERTIGO (that was the worst).  Re the Vertigo, I didn&#39;t fall but experienced it whenever moving.  I was bumping into walls and was dizzy whenever I moved position (e.g. sitting to standing &amp; vice versus).  These symptoms lasted 5-7 days after they began (both shots).

                                                2.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I started getting dizzy and vomiting. I vomited 6 or 7 times. I was so dizzy I couldn&#39;t open my eyes without getting sick. We called ER and explained that we thought I was having a reaction to the vaccine, and their response was they had never heard of that type of reaction. I was sick all night, called my primary Dr in the am and they told me to go to ER. We had to call ambulance to take me there because I was so sick and couldn&#39;t open my eyes without having to vomit. Room spun in circles. My arrival at ER, they did MRI, EKG, blood work. My blood pressure was very high, so they connected me to a heart monitor. I had low Magnesium due to vomiting so much.  I was treated with Valium and anti-vert medication and fluids. I stayed overnight in hospital- had PT Jan 13th  for DX of Vertigo. Then referred to Outpatient PT for Vertigo.  Dr&#39;s felt it was a &#34;coincident&#34; that I got Vertigo shortly after vaccine, and strongly felt it was not related.  . Today is Jan 17th, and I am still dizzy, but feeling better. I have an appointment with my primary Jan 18th and not sure if I should take the 2nd dose. That is the question.

                                                As I was sitting at my computer and suddenly I could barely keep my eyes open, I was so tired I couldn&#39;t lift my arms and once I closed my eyes, I could not muster the strength to open them.  I felt like I was going to faint and then I got nauseated and I knew I was going to throw up. With my husband&#39;s help, I did manage to get to the bathroom (about 6 steps away).  I threw up and immediately sat down in the nearest chair.  I threw up a second time into a vessel after that.  I then got a massive headache and chills.  I could barely walk with assistance up the stairs to go to bed.  I have never been more fatigued.  After going to bed, I slept all night and woke the next day still fatigued, but nothing like the night before.  I was able to work, even though I felt really tired.  I did not have much of an appetite all day and two days later, I still feel fatigued.

Couldn?t go to work the next day due to body aches, arm soreness, extreme tiredness.   Slept almost  all day 1-19-21.  Spiked low grade fever during the night.  Worked 1-20-21, but extremely sleepy.  Injection site got hot and red.    Slept 12 hours that night.  Went to work 1-21-21 feeling good, just still a little arm soreness.

A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 24Dec2020 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, ongoing allergies. She was asthmatic and believed that the virus would have affected her differently if she didn&#39;t get the vaccine. If she was to catch the virus and didn&#39;t have the vaccine she may not have come out of it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient denied getting any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. Received the COVID vaccine at her workplace. The patient got COVID virus on 07Jan2021. It was also reported that the patient lost a lot of weight, but still plump, coughing, tightness in chest, upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, body aches, all on an unspecified date. Emergency room visit needed for the events (body aches, runny nose). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Covid PCR testing: negative on 04Jan2021, positive on 07Jan2021, rapid COVID testing: negative on 01Jan2021. The outcome of the event (got COVID virus) was not recovered, of other remain events was unknown.  Clinical course: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Dec2020, and a couple weeks later she got the COVID virus (07Jan2021). Mentioned she lost a lot of weight, but still plump. Probably be in the hospital now. Still had some coughing, tightness in chest, but it&#39;s not as bad. Upper chest tightness with post nasal drip, like the flu, runny nose in throat that goes down into the lungs and when it goes down she coughs and hacks to get rid of it. Went to the doctor office on the 01Jan2021 and did a rapid test and it was negative. Then on 04Jan2021 she did another PCR Covid test and it was negative. On 07Jan2021 she had symptoms and was insistent on getting another test since having body aches, runny nose. Got the re-test and it came back positive when she went to the emergency room. Got the PCR test. The patient thought that the way they were testing is how it&#39;s spreading. Did the testing on the 04Jan2021 and they used a swab bigger than a cue tip, it was huge and couldn&#39;t get far up enough instead of the tiny ones. On the 07Jan2021 at her job, emergency room, they had the tiny ones and was able to go further up and that&#39;s when she tested positive. Mentioned using salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) nebulizer, over the counter cough syrup, prescription azelastine hydrochloride;fluticasone propionate (DYMISTA) nasal spray, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED). When has the dry cough she uses the ALBUTEROL nebulizer with the machine and vials at home and that slows down the coughing a lot and the other stuff with the lungs. Not taking any steroids. Using SUDAFED to stop the runny nose from post nasal drip from going into lungs.

(Patient stated shortness of breath was another symptom that she had from COVID and is continuing somewhat especially when I was a mask for work -  but had not put it in the first report). Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

I took Tylenol - which helped.  I was admitted to the hospital for February 8 for bronchitis. About the fourth of February is when I started getting symptoms of this. I was in the  hospital from the 8-10th. Hospital. Bronchitis resolved around the 20th of February.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization.

He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information is limited and does not allow a full medical assessment. Considering temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of blood sugar decrease, cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 24 hours after I got my injection I began to feel cold. I am by nature always cold  but within 30 minutes I began to shiver. This intensified and I got to the point I was shaking hard and so cold. I had also had a headache all day but that is not unusual for me as I frequently have sinus headaches that can last all day. I took my temperature which was 98.3 but I took Tylenol anyway realizing I was likely having a vaccine reaction. I got into bed under my electric blanket. Ninety minutes later I had finally warmed up. In fact my feet and hands felt like they were on fire. I rechecked my temperature and it was up to 100.9. I peeled off my numerous clothing layers and I actually felt better since the chilling had stopped. I ate some dinner and watched TV and went to be around 11pm. I slept fitfully which is normal for me. As the night wore on I began chilling again. I got up sometime around 5am and took more Tylenol. If I remember my temperature was around 100.1. I slept several hours and woke up feeling ?back to normal?.

This 64-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscular on 18Dec2020 at single dose on left upper arm (lot: EKS730), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 14:30 at single dose (lot: EL1284 or EKI284) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient did not have anything with the first shot except a sore left arm on 18Dec2020. She stated that if she lays on left side it is sore. The patient had the sore left arm both times that she got the vaccine. She got second dose of vaccine on 05Jan2021 at 2:30pm and had a blasting headache and just had chills that went away about hour ago on 05Jan2021. She did not have a fever but her skin felt hot on 05Jan2021. She stated that she had dry heaves on 05Jan2021. The patient started that she had a blasting headache within a few hours of the vaccine and it gradually got worst by the time she went to bed. Stated that the chills and dry heaves started then and throughout the night. The chills stopped an hour before she got up. Stated that she went to check her temperature and did not have a fever despite having chills and her skin feeling hot. Stated that nausea started about 10 at night on 05Jan2021. Seriousness for blasting headache, chills and dry heaves was disabling, for nausea was medically significant, for other events was non-serious. The patient took Ibuprofen for the headache. Stated that she was going to try to drink something. The outcome of sore left arm was not recovered; of chills was recovered on 06Jan2021. The outcome of other events was recovering. The causality for blasting headache, chills, dry heaves, nausea and skin felt hot was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Agency Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the headache, chills, dry heaves and other reported events due to temporal relationship.

A 64-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Batch/lot number: EL1284, Expiry Apr2021, intramuscularly on 30Dec2020 02:15 (Dose 1), right arm as a single dose (age at vaccination 64 years old) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included allergy (usually in the fall she has allergy problems).  Her age is considered high risk, works in medical profession (Surgical Tech). Concomitant medication included levocetirizine (Walgreen&#39;s generic) 5mg, tablet, by mouth, at night for allergy. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine last 30Dec(2020) and after 2 days (on 01Jan2021) she developed symptoms: Sore arms, severe sore throats, back ache/ back was sore, temperature was up / low grade temp (never high), coughing, body aches. Her back and her legs were sore. Her whole body was achy. It was &#34;like flu-ish kinda.&#34; She also had a headache. She started getting the sore throat and headache on 01Jan2021, and she felt a little cold on 02Jan2021. On 02Jan(2021), her first temperature was 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She states she had everything except for the GI issues. Around 02Jan(2021) or 03Jan(2021), her symptoms were progressively getting worse. She was told to get COVID tested. There were three exposures since Christmas Eve. So, she went and got a rapid COVID test (04Jan2021) and it came back negative. They also sent out a test that day. She was also tested for Strep (04Jan2021) too because her throat was so sore. It was almost like she had like thrush along with it. She states it was almost like a thrush because she had like a white tongue (onset 03Jan2021). Her throat was so sore, but it was a different kind of sore throat compared to a sore throat she has had before. She explains where the nasopharynx was at the top, it&#39;s almost like it was sore from there. It was sore to swallow, it was &#34;a bizarre sore throat.&#34; She clarified she noticed the &#34;thrushy&#34; part of her throat around 03Jan2021. The strep test ended up being negative but she believes she had thrush because she was given medication and the medication was clearing that up. However, she still had the symptoms. Because her symptoms only started a few days before, they thought she should maybe wait a couple of days and if she is not feeling any better, she should be retested (for COVID). She went back again yesterday (07Jan2021). She had another Rapid COVID test and also a flu swab and both tests came back negative. She mentions they also did another COVID test (the send out type) and she should get that back around 1pm to find out the results of that.  They also did a CBC (07Jan2021) and everything was normal. Her white count was at 7. She was waiting for the 3rd COVID test result today (08Jan2021).  She reported that about three days afterwards, she didn&#39;t notice the soreness in /her arm. Her throat has improved. Her fever was down to 98 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday (07Jan2021). She states she was feeling better today (08Jan2021). She commented &#34;the lethargy, though.&#34; She emptied the dishwasher yesterday (07Jan2021) and had to sit down after emptying it. She states her symptoms have her a little worried. She recovered from the sore arms in Jan2021. The patient was recovering from  the severe sore throat, back ache, low grade temp, coughing, body aches/ whole body was achy, believes she had thrush, white tongue, legs were sore, headache, and felt a little cold. The outcome of the event lethargy was not recovered. She was wondering if this was a reaction to the vaccine.

She had sweats kind of.; Tested positive for COVID; Tested positive for COVID; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A contactable nurse (patient herself) reported that a 64-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK5730, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the upper left arm on 21Dec2020 17:00 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypertension (blood pressure high). She was a former smoker, a teenage smoker. She has not smoked since the age of 19 years old. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for high blood pressure. The patient informed that she was vaccinated on 21Dec2020. On 05Jan2021, she had a positive COVID Test and she was wondering when she should have the second dose of the COVID Vaccine. She thought initially she just had a cold. She took the COVID test as a precaution. It started out with a stuffy nose. She had a congested cough, upper airway cough, nothing deep in the lungs. She had a low grade fever. It was like 99.9. It was possible it was higher, but she had taken Ibuprofen at night. She woke up soaking wet. She had sweats kind of. Her temperature however never registered a true fever if a fever  was considered 100.4. She was not really having body aches any more unusual than one would have for a 64 year old. She has a very mild sore throat. Her stuffy nose had improved, it&#39;s still there slightly, but not like it was the first few days. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Test positive for covid19 found 14 day following the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination, bnt162b2, no adequate effect of the suspect vaccine thus could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.

                                                forceful beat feeling in her chest/she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point; seemed like UTI symptoms were coming back; felt really wiped out and worn down/tired; anxiety; racing/ pounding in chest; potassium was a little low; elevated blood pressure; arm a little bit sore; 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 64-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 28Dec2020 07:15 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hepatitis C which cleared in 2016, hysterectomy was done in 2004 or 2005, cyst removed from breast long ago, ongoing arthritis in left knee, urinary tract infection was treated in Nov2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She received the first vaccine on 28Dec2020. She did fine that day. She came home and laid down and rested. Her temperature went up to 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit but was resolved that same day/night. Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 64-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included COVID-19 in Nov2020 (8 weeks ago). Concomitant medications were not reported. After getting the vaccine, she got sick as a dog and couldn&#39;t work. She had a fever that reached 100.0, she had body aches. It was explained that she has arthritis prior to having the COVID vaccine and after getting it, it went after the over growth bones in her hands. The caller continues that her joint hurt, all of them, but it was throbbing the most where she has visual arthritis. To sum it up, she had chills, nausea, and body aches the first day. The caller took Tylenol regardless of what the paper said; this was on Friday, 08Jan2021. She kept taking the Tylenol. The next day, she was still tired but when she quit taking the Tylenol on the 2nd day the symptoms returned. It was clarified that she took it in the beginning of the second day twice but at the end of the day wanted to see if she was over it all so she stopped the Tylenol. The symptoms all returned so she took again at bed time, the Tylenol, this was Saturday. On Sunday, she had diarrhea but only a couple times and though it was weird, after that is was over. That day she took Tylenol once. She was calling because she was scared about the second dose, this one produced a big immune response and she says that usually happens with the second dose. The caller wants to know if she should take the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to have this happen again or it be worse. She thought since she had already had COVID it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, her immune response. The first dose was given on 07Jan2021. It was explained the only thing unresolved was from when she had COVID, she still has a cough and no taste. There are just few thing she can taste and smell now. The patient said that all the symptoms had resolved as of Monday, the 11Jan2021. Actually, she felt pretty good on the 10Jan2021 so let&#39;s say Sunday. She explained that most people get this on the second dose and so if she going have a third response she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She was calling to get an answer to her question, the doctor told her to call to see what could be recommended. She has really good doctors, three of them. The doctor didn&#39;t know what to tell, they said if they were her, they would not take the second shot. The patient said she really needs to go. No need to continue when there is no one to tell her if she should take the second shot or not. The patient asked to be contacted via email to relay information about people&#39;s immune response to the first dose verses the second dose, is it greater or less. Clinical outcome of the events recovered on 11Jan2021.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

I had joint and body aches. I experienced lightheadedness when I got up when fever was 101.8 at 2:30 pm.  I had to lay down again and apply a wet towel. Once I felt able to walk (about 10 minutes later) I ate a popsicle and then proceeded to take two 325 mg of Tylenol. Within 30 to 45 minutes fever subsided. I then ate soup, crackers and an orange and drank cranapple juice. I went back to bed and slept some more. I woke up at 5 pm and had a cup of soup, a quarter of an apple and gatorade. At 9 pm I took two more Tylenol to be safe and when to sleep. Sunday I was fine. My arm, never was swollen only a little sore.

A 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 07Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital, not a Military Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient got the Flu Vaccine last part of Sep2020 or Beginning of Oct2020. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EK57530), via an unspecified route of administration at left Upper arm on 17Dec2020 9:10AM for covid-19 immunization. She only had a sore arm. It started the same day, a couple of hours after getting the vaccine. It went away a day to a day and a half after it started. After that she was fine. She got the second dose on 07Jan2021. After the second dose, immediately, like within five minutes her arm became very sore, this event was assessed as non-serious by HCP. Also, that Thursday (07Jan2021) night after getting the second dose of the Vaccine around 9PM-10PM she started to get chills, myalgia, severe headache, and nausea. She also mentioned she was so sick during the night she was not able to get up and around. She felt like she had a temperature and by the time it was checked her temperature was 101.9. She was febrile all through 08Jan2021. She started to become afebrile 09Jan2021 with improvement and by 10Jan2021 all her symptoms had gone away and completely resolved. Seriousness Criteria: Stated she felt these are serious. She was unable to go to work on Friday. She could not return back to work until Monday. The HCP assessed all events were related to the vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovered on 10Jan2021. She stated, even though she got so sick with getting the vaccine she was just continuously telling her self this is better than having COVID. She stated she even told people even if she knew after getting the shot she would have this reaction she would still take it. She has seen death occur from COVID and does not want that to happen.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, clinical course and known safety profile of the product, the reported events chills, myalgia, severe headache, nausea and fever were likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Day 3 102.7; myalgia; fatigue; tracheitis; Respiration 40; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 64-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El3426, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on the left arm on 24Dec2020 at the age of 64 years old, lot number: Ek9231. On 16Jan2021 at 11:00 PM, the patient experienced faintness, fevers at 101.5 and 102.7 (on day 3), myalgia, fatigue, tracheitis for 3.5 days- stopped around 4AM on Wednesday, and respiration rate of 40. The patient has no COVID prior vaccination and has not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.5 on 16Jan2021, heart rate (HR): 80 on 16Jan2021, respiration: 40 on 16Jan2021 and body temperature: 102.7 on 20Jan2021. No treatment was administered for the events. The patient recovered from the event tracheitis on 20Jan2021 at 04:00 while recovering from the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Faint cannot be excluded.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

                                                Severe difficulty breathing; difficulty breathing frightened her; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 64 -year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL9262), intramuscular (on the upper left shoulder) on 27Jan2021 09:20 (at the age of 64-year-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed about 14 years ago, breast cancer from Dec2017 and ongoing diagnosed in Dec2017, ongoing asthma she was diagnosed with asthma when she was 39 years old, surgery from an unknown date, she had surgery to correct a deviated septum and her asthma got better, she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. Concomitant medication included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). On 27Jan2021 she had the first injection. It was about 14 to 16 hours after the injection that she had severe difficulty breathing. Reported she has asthma. She was a cancer survivor, and she has high blood pressure after all the treatment. The difficulty breathing woke her out of her sleep. She had to call the doctor since she is concerned about her second dose which is scheduled for 17Feb2021. The difficulty breathing frightened her, and it was not an immediate reaction, she had the shot at 9:30 am (clarifies she received the injection at 09:20 am) and between 1 to 2 am in the night, she woke up not able to breathe. She could not use her inhaler since she could not really breathe in. She was obviously able to get some air in since she did not pass out. She contacted her doctor and he will send her a prescription to get an Epipen, so she has it on hand when she gets her second dose. Her doctor does not want her to not get the second dose. States she is concerned about other asthmatics receiving the vaccine and wanted to call and report this. She expected it to happen onsite where she received the injection but it did not. Her doctor asked her if she thought it was an asthma attack and she told her doctor that she has not felt like this in 24 years. Treatment/Outcome: She stepped out into the cold to shrink her airways and then was able to use her inhaler. Reports it was not a 2 hour episode thank god, and within 15 minutes she was able to force an inhaler dose in. Everything is fine. She is a breast cancer survivor and cannot use her right side so she had the injection on her left side in her upper shoulder, she has to wait 5 years to be considered cancer free. Her doctor suggested to use her albuterol inhaler for 4 days in advance of getting the second dose of the vaccine. She would think that would be abusing her albuterol but she will do that since she was instructed to do so by her doctor. She was terrified. She will have an Epipen on hand when she goes to get her second dose.  She understands the symptoms can be worse with the second dose, she is anticipating everything should be fine. The outcome of the event difficulty of breathing was recovered on Jan2021, for the other event was unknown. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations, states she has had everything. No Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks.

There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient worked at a nursing facility, but she was not a healthcare professional. After receiving the first vaccine, she felt great. The vaccine built her immunity up, which was good. With the second vaccine, she got very ill over it on an unspecified date. The patient was asking if there had been other people reporting side effects of the vaccine. The patient further reported that after she was given the second vaccine, they had a waiting time where she had to sit and wait about 15 minutes and it was fine. After work on an unspecified date, she had gone to pick up some groceries and it hit her like a ton of bricks. It was really, really bad.

The pharmacist told her everyone was different, but that she would definitely know. The patient stated she had very bad stomach issues; it felt like someone was stabbing her on an unspecified date. She had no vomiting or diarrhea, but when she ate, it was horrible. She couldn&#39;t eat; every time food reached her stomach, it was a horrible pain. She also experienced some fatigue on an unspecified date. She got tired a lot. She had to call her employer and tell them that she wouldn&#39;t be coming in. This went on for a week. She still had some side effects, but its working its way out of her and she could tell. The patient stated she didn&#39;t believe her employer believed her. She had called and left messages and it went no where. She was afraid and she didn&#39;t want to lose her job. The patient stated that she really hadn&#39;t eaten for a couple of days at the time of the report. She asked one of the nurses where she worked if she should be drinking water and continue to try and eat and the nurse told her to drink as much water as she could and rest her body. The patient didn&#39;t believe her employer believed that this was actually happening to her. The patient was very upset that she could lose her job and she didn&#39;t know what to do or who else to call.

The patient felt sick since she got it, some side effects have been less, some stayed the same or got worse. Her skin was burning up, her arms, her face, her stomach, her back, and her chest were burning up.

She also had nausea and no appetite, though she has gotten a little better, it has been at least a full week or so. She had a headache and a bad sore throat also. She got home from getting the shot, probably maybe 5 or 6 hours after getting the shot. The patient&#39;s weight was 145-150lbs. The outcome of the event skin burning sensation was not recovered while for the remaining events was unknown.

She was taken to the emergency room and was diagnosed with pericardial effusion and admitted for treatment that included draining fluid from the sac around her heart.  She was released and then developed the same symptoms again within a week.  She again had pericardial effusion, and was told she had severe emphysema with no prior diagnosis.  She is still hospitalized and is now suffering heart failure with no clear diagnosis as to why, no acceptable plan of treatment, and a prognosis of wait and see.  She has consistently tested negative for Covid19.

She tested positive for Covid so for the last couple of weeks. She had Covid, the fever broke about 5 to 6 days ago, she had a low grade fever after that, also the symptoms were gone now, there was little fatigue and little rash on back. She was scheduled to take second shot now and was trying to find in research about taking the second shot inspite of having covid. She cant find anything, most of the people never heard this and primary care physician said to go ahead and take the shot, but some people and some researchers said you should not, because she might have symptoms later and she should wait. The treatment was not received for the adverse events. Outcome of tested positive for Covid and 6 days was unknown and for other events it was recovering.

For the next week my breathing became more and more labored with difficulty in functioning and needing to be in a reclining position in order to breathe. By the 10th day, o n March 15th I was hospitalized and subsequently had tests run on heart and lungs. My blood oxygen would drop to the low 80&#39;s if I took just a few steps. Today, on March 19th I am home and slowly improving but still needing to be mostly resting.

                                                received the vaccine on December 17th and tested positive for Covid on December 27th/COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020; received the vaccine on December 17th and tested positive for Covid on December 27th/COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 11:00 in left deltoid at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, bilateral thyroidectomy in 2014. Family Medical History: Father died of lung cancer. Mother died of cardiac arrest in 1972. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for bilateral thyroidectomy. The patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and tested positive for covid on 27Dec2020. The adverse events resulted in emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020, COVID PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test: positive on 28Dec2020. Vaccination facility type was hospital. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Received COVID Vaccine on 17Dec2020. Tested positive for COVID in emergency room on 27Dec2020. Tested positive on a COVID PCR test on 28Dec2020. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Caller received the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. Tested positive for COVID on 27Dec2020. Is about to get the second dose of COVID Vaccine and would like to know if she should proceed or wait. Since quarantine, she has had no fever. Is slightly short of breath and has a headache. Works in COVID units in a hospital. Wants to make sure she can receive the second dose. Stated she had no adverse reaction to the COVID Vaccine unless an adverse reaction can occur two weeks after. Is attributing the shortness of breath and headache to testing positive for COVID. Shortness of breath and headache only occurred after testing positive for COVID. Reason she went to the hospital is because she lost her sense of smell. She got tested and was positive for COVID. Lost sense of smell, went to Emergency Room, and notified doctor of positive test the following day, 28Dec2020. Clarified she just went to the emergency department to get tested for COVID and then went home. Was called with positive results in an hour. Caller wanted to know when she should proceed with getting her second dose of Covid vaccine. She is supposed to receive her second dose tomorrow. She thought she was going to take second dose when I completely recovered. Caller asked if she waited until the 13th to receive second dose of Covid vaccine, would it be effective. She would feel more comfortable doing that. The outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported COVID-19 based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 9 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

She reported she was very sick in the hospital and is now getting well. However it was unknown if she was admitted to hospital (clarification pending). She wanted to know recommendations about the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine because with her experience, she is not comfortable having the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.

This consumer reported similar events in two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number and expiry date: not reported), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. Concomitant medication included vitamins nos. It was reported that both the patient and her husband received the Pfizer Vaccine on 10Jan2021; and they had reaction to it. They both both had bad arm swelling and pain. Her was worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm. At first, they just thought it was a reaction as they read reactions could be and then she started to get small cough but by Friday, her husband went and got tested and on Wednesday he was tested positive and this is after the vaccine and then he got the results and it said he was positive. So, Saturday, they both went and got tested, they did the rapid and they did what they call the PCR, and they both came positive for both of them and this was after they receive the first vaccine. So, she thought they need to know that they got sick and it was after the vaccine. The patient needed to ask a question as they were supposed to go for their second vaccine on 31Jan2021 and do they do it even though they got sick. They knew they were claiming that they can&#39;t get sick because of the vaccine but it&#39;s very ironic that they did get this. They had been following CBC guidelines, both her husband and the patient because they are older and they wear mask all the time and they did everything they needed to and they could not understand how they got this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Rapid and PCR: positive in Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;bad arm swelling and pain; worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm&#34; which included treatment with Tylenol. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

I am not sure it was related to the injection. It resolved on sat Feb 20th 2021.  I still have mild nausea but am on Ozempic which gives me nausea some of the time. I did not feel well but finally fell asleep and slept until AM.

Had all of the side effects, chills, fever, muscle aches, joint pain and a wicked headache. Monday was the same minus the headache. Today, still have joint pain and feel very weak. The nurse that gave us our vaccinations said that if we experienced any of the side effects, we should let our primary physician know.  Hopefully all of this is normal and I will be back to my normal self soon. I am concerned because most of the information I have read says 24 hours and effects should be gone. Not so with me. Hope all is well with you and your family.  &#34;  Spoke w/ pt on phone and she stated her s/s are subsiding, other than the arthralgia, RN

                                                The rash is up under arm, in armpit and is in the same arm of injection but there is no rash at the injection site.; because there was some itching under the arm.  I went to see a dermatologist who says it has nothing to do with vaccine.  I also had a slight headache; I also had a slight headache a day or two after the shot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 on left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic kidney disease. The patient had chronic kidney disease and its real important for someone with her disease to get the vaccine, because if she got the actual virus it would hit the kidneys hard. The patient had no positive covid or antibody test prior to the vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. The patient stated that only thing she thinks would be related was that, she noticed this rather after using the hot tub, her husband just cleaned the hot tub and put chemicals in it, maybe she had a reaction to chemicals used to clean the hot tub. On 24Jan2021, the patient was reported after 10 days the patient had rash was up under the arm, near the arm pit, in the same arm of injection but there was no rash at the actual injection site, however her skin was beautiful, there was no spot except under the armpit. She got the injection a week ago Friday, she noticed the rash days later, on Sunday with itching under the arm. The Dermatologist says it has nothing to do with vaccine. The patient also had a slight headache a day or 2 (on 15Jan2021) after the shot, not a migraine, it was a slight dull headache, but went away. The patient went to the dermatologist yesterday, and he said it had nothing to do with the vaccine. She went to the dermatologist on 26Jan2021. Caller again stated that there was no rash at the injection site, but there was a rash underneath the arm in the arm pit. She still has it, she just started to use medicine last night. It&#39;s getting better. The Dermatologist prescribed a topical cream and its some kind of cortisone. The patient did not have any severe reaction like head swelling or swelling. The patient was scheduled for her second dose on 05Feb2021. The patient recovered from headache on 16Jan2021, recovering from rash, and for itching it was unknown.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She got an email saying she could get the vaccine, but didn&#39;t think to call the doctor office to ask about the Medrol pack (steroid pack) or if it could cause any interactions. So the office told her to call. Later mentions along with the Medrol pack, she got an injection in the office of Toradol and this was before getting the vaccine.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I felt faint numerous times up to 90 hours afterward.  Then complete resolution.  I also had 101 fever for 24 hours, chills, body aches, but these symptoms have been listed as common.

A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose (1.8 cc but unsure ((heard that but could be wrong) recommended dose)) as works with COVID positive patients. Medical history was none. No concomitant medications. Caller just wanted to know if she could take Tylenol for mild symptoms after having the COVID 19 vaccine. She received the vaccine yesterday. She was wondering if it would make the symptoms a little less. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The side effects started last night. On 11Jan2021, she was expecting arm soreness, but this was worse. She developed it about 6 hours after the shot. This was the sorest her arm has ever been from any injection, and she had had a lot of them. Her arm was almost too sore to move. This morning, it was much better. It was really bad last night. She was also very achy, and experienced drowsiness, also has a very bad headache on 11Jan2021. The CDC website stated before the vaccine patients should not take Tylenol because it can tamper with the immune system response. It said it was alright to take after, but she just wanted to call to make sure. Investigation Assessment was no. The outcome of the event very achy was not recovered, of the events was recovering.

                                                2 days after vaccination right thighs and right leg started to have pain similar to pain I got with polymyalgia rheumatica that I have had in past and I though it was a flare up. A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

Just thought it was my eczema flaring up (it&#39;s worse in the winter).  After about 2 weeks, developed red areas on my body (torso, arms, legs and feet)  - self-monitored - but got progressively worse.  Dermatologist believes it is eczema aggravated by the vaccine.  Provided  a cortisone injection (right arm).  Will monitor for two weeks to determine improvement or lack of improvement.

A 66-year-old female patient (wife) received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 13:00 at single dose on the left upper arm for COVID-19 immunization, reported as &#34;doesn&#39;t want to get the COVID&#34;. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The reporter said that she and her husband got first dose of COVID vaccine last week (27Jan2021) and they both got sick, had a major headache in Jan2021, cough and chills both on 27Jan2021, and also she wanted to know if she and her husband can take the second dose, scheduled on 17Feb2021. Patient stated that major headache went in on a &#34;Wednesday&#34;. Her husband and her did, and went through vaccination portal, to get an appointment, appointments were very trying, as they were to do all healthcare providers first, which is understandable, and then the vaccine. They were trying to make it available for teachers, as they are going back to school, in school learning in March, so all teachers were the next step and then also anyone over 65 was able to go on the portal with the state to get an appointment to go and get a vaccination. She and husband  have a daughter who was a teacher, and she said to go on the portal to get the shot, and they said they didn&#39;t have access to it, so she went on the site, and they got it in on 27Jan2021. The headache occurred after the 27Jan2021. Patient stated that as soon as they got home, her husband works full time, she lost her job in October, and she was home and he said &#34;how are you feeling&#34;, he went back to work, patient came home and said she felt alright except for her arm then she got a really bad headache. The husband came home and said he felt like crap, really bad, patient said she did too, she was the type of person she never ever gets sick and if he was sick she does not say she was sick. Patient had such a bad headache, she thought her brain was ready to jump out of her head. Headache subsided after two days. She has recovered completely from the headache. Cough started almost immediately (27Jan2021), but patient did not cough today, but did last night, it was usually a deep cough. Today she has not coughed at all. Chills started probably that evening (27Jan2021), when she came home, the shot was around 1PM and chills started in the evening, and went away probably, they had gone back and forth for around two days  but they were gone, she has recovered completely. Patient wished to add that they were both so fatigued, so tired, almost like, both she and her husband were very active, when they were down for the count, really exhausted, after this whole vaccination experience, both of them have been exhausted, to the point of going to bed at 8, and they were not 8:00 going to bed people. she doesn&#39;t want to be a pain, as she knows people have legit concerns, Patient doesn&#39;t want to waste time, her main concern is the second vaccination, if she does not have to, or is suggested to not take it, or her husband, she doesn&#39;t want the second vaccination to cause more severe side effects. The patient further reported, that they both experienced major side effects: chills, headaches, sore throat, major cough, fatigue that was &#34;just unbelievable, both of us are exhausted.&#34; Her second dose is scheduled on 17Feb2021 and his husband is scheduled on 20Feb2021. Patient was asking &#34;if this was after the first dose, what&#39;s going to happen after the second dose?&#34;. Outcome of the events headache and chills was recovered in 2021 for cough was recovered on 02Feb2021 while for other events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021. She called her doctor on Monday and was seen by her doctor on Tuesday, 09Feb2021. The patient was referred to the eye center. Her headache was getting a little better. On 10Feb2021, the patient was seen at an institution, her retina and macula looked good, so she was referred to the ED. The patient was told she probably had a stroke. The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown. The has trouble reading now since the stroke.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to the vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent or underlying medical conditions in this elderly patient with excessive weight (BMI=29) and underlying elevated cholesterol.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318 (not clarified further)), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and loratadine (CLARITIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 03Feb2021 at an unspecified dose for unspecified indication. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol and Sleep disorder, both from unknown date. Concomitant medication included alprazolam (XANAX), calcium (CALCIUM), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), Multivitamin, taking a statin to prevent high cholesterol and L-methylfolate, stated it is like a folic acid drug. Because the patient really can&#39;t take anti-depressant she reacted to them all (Unspecified Medications), so that worked for her and helped her to keep up her spirit. The patient reported her side effects. She didn&#39;t want to interfere with anything but she was having lots of Gastrointestinal issues which were inconvenient. She was up in the middle of the night, happened not within 48 hour after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine but around 60 hours after the vaccine, early this morning (06Feb2021) like around 2 am. The patient was having a reaction after the vaccine but they seemed to be like delayed reactions. Not anything with breathing, she had gastrointestinal stuff going on. The patient had chills, no fever, body aches and she was really going to the bathroom nonstop in the night. It seemed to have been like 2 days after she got the shot like they were worst yesterday (05Feb2021). And she experienced achy, chills, nausea, diarrhea and sore arm in Feb2021. She would like to take TYLENOL and IMODIUM and she didn&#39;t know what she could take because she didn&#39;t want anything to interfere with that as she had been reading a lot. The patient wanted information on IMODIUM to prevent diarrhea, TYLENOL for body aches, chills (no fever), and FLONASE for sinus. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The patient actually didn&#39;t even take, that morning that day when she was getting the shot, she called the pharmacist to see if she could spray her nose with the FLONASE for sinus and he told her that he didn&#39;t think it was a good idea and that maybe she should just take CLARITIN, so she did. But she took CLARITIN that morning (03Feb2021) and she was hoping that didn&#39;t interfere. She was just nervous about it as she didn&#39;t want that to interfere with the work that it was. The patient was still suffering, less, like she didn&#39;t have the diarrhea anymore. She still had a little achy. She did get the sore arm but only for one day, so it wasn&#39;t so bad. The action taken in response to the events for loratadine was unknown. The outcome of event diarrhea and got the sore arm was recovered on an unspecified date in Feb2021, of event achy was recovering, of other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She started with a mild headache. On the 7th day she was slammed. Her doctor said it was pretty unusual after this long. She had a temperature of 102 degrees. It was like having a full blown auto immune flare that lasted for two days and went away. She was left with a great big flare. She was not able to provide full details as she had an appointment that she had to pay out of pocket for. She was not concerned about the reaction that takes a day or 2 to get over. She was having hell from her usual responses. She was afraid in six months she would be crippled. The outcome of events was unknown. She was due to receive the second dose on Tuesday.

                                                The evening after patient received vaccine, she started to develop low grade fever and urticarial rash at the vaccine site. The urticaria improved the following day, as did the fevers. Then 3/5, the fevers started again, several times per day, as high as 102 at home.  In association with the fever she has had some mild nausea, x1 non-bloody emesis last night, as well as rigors/night sweats.  She went to urgent care and eventually was admitted to the hospital for the following 9 days. During this admission, she continued to have fevers intermittently as high as ~103. She also developed more generalized urticarial rash (worst on trunk), and lab abnormalities including low platelets and elevated liver function tests. She had extensive testing, ultimately determined likely vaccine reaction, started on prednisone 40 daily and improved for discharge to home on 3/17 without fevers x48 hours and with improving labs.

The heaviest shaking was of the right arm and hand which was where the vaccine was administered. Made my way to bedroom on my walker to tell hubby I was not feeling well,  Took blood pressure which was elevated and my heart felt like it was beating out my chest, Bllod pressure was elevated and so was pulse. Shaking continued and breathing was shallow, Waited 10 minutes and retook vitals, BP and pulse up more, Called 911, Paramedics came and monitored my vitals several times which after 20 minutes started declining, Could not say conclusively if was vaccine related. Elected due to Covid not to be transported to hospital and signed off on declination, Was told by paramedics to call 911 again if symptoms reoccurred and go to hospital,  In successive days I still continue to have pin-prick feelings and numbness in my right fingers, More difficult to walk than usual,

Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

Noteworthy, I had  as a precaution taken prednisone 20mg p.o  about 2 hours before the injection.  I had to take more  later that afternoon because of symptoms. I then seem better but several times since the vaccine I have needed to uses the inhaler  and take prednisone  more than I have except after an infection about 6 years ago that precipitated similar symptoms to now. Today I had a flare significant enough that except for covid I might have gone to the ER or urgent care.

A 67-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 13:15 in left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization.

Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication included methylphenidate hydrochloride (RITALIN) and one-a-day ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS), both from Dec2020 for an unspecified indication. Immediately after vaccine, patient experienced flushing, then lightheadedness, and waves of flushing and chills every minute for several hours; tongue numbness, dry mouth, cold hands and feet; no rash, no breathing difficulty - normal vital signs on 24Dec2020 13:30.

A 67-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose in her left arm for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no investigation assessment. It was reported that it had been 24 hours, she received her first bnt162b2 (reported as Pfizer COVID vaccine), yesterday (on 06Jan2021), and she was wondering, her arm was sore on 07Jan2021, which she thought was normal and fatigue on 06Jan2021, she got right away, she didn&#39;t know if that was normal, but she got a metallic taste in her mouth on 06Jan2021. It felt like a metallic taste when she swallows, a little metallic taste, yesterday (on 06Jan2021) was more than today, it was after the vaccine, about 7 hours after. She thought in her head, like the aluminum chewing gum, when kids chew it, it had a metallic taste, like the (company name withheld) wrapper she used to chew on it. Provides she was shrinking. Provide she was wearing stretch pants when providing weight. She Googled and didn&#39;t see the metallic taste, the only thing she saw with metallic taste is if you have the actual virus, she didn&#39;t have it, she was fine. Maybe it was all in her head. Arm was sore not right away, it built up, like when you stretch like with the flu shot, she lifted and it&#39;s sore, and she felt sleepy. It was like with the flu shot, it took a few days to go away. Last night on 06Jan2021, she was very sleepy, she was kind of sleepy, but it could be watching the Capitol and insanity, but she was yawning a lot more, her eyes felt heavy, she was ok, she had an appetite and is fine, she would drink (company name withheld) now. Thought she was peaking with it, she would go to sleep early today (07Jan2021), her eyes were still heavy, she wanted to close them and took a nap, but couldn&#39;t. It was like her saliva has a metallic taste in her mouth, it may be in her head, she googled to see side effects and when they start, it may be going soon, who knows, she was just wondering. The taste was worse yesterday (06Jan2021), and it wasn&#39;t IV or anything like that, the patient wanted to know how can that be. She had to go back on the 27th for her second dose. She had been tested and retested on an unspecified date, and it was offered for those 65 and over, and she was lucky to get an appointment. The outcome of the event metallic taste was recovering; the events fatigue and eyes heavy was not recovered; the outcome of the rest events was unknown.

                                                Vertigo started after lying down the same night of getting the vaccine.  Vertigo continued every night and was accompanied by nystamus upon waking each morning.  Symptoms continued for the first several hours after awakening then would gradually get better and was much lighter during the day.  Would return every night and next morning and this continued for the next 7 days.   My head felt like it was in a fog and it seemed harder to think.  It was also very sinus like.  No nasal congestion, no post nasal drip, no cough, but my head felt thick and full.  I had headaches which I never get.  I took my blood pressure to be sure and it was normal.  I took Claritin (without the D), Flonase alone and then also Dymista, did the Neti pot, and took Ibuprofen.  Headache got better but still had the head fog.  Today is post vaccine day 8 and I finally woke up this morning feeling better.  Hope it lasts but I answered &#34;Unknown&#34; to Item 20 below because it&#39;s too soon to tell.

                                                yesterday I got a really, really bad headache, that I still have; sore arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 06Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung condition, sarcoidosis, immune system problems, ongoing headache and migraines. Concomitant medication included topiramate for headache and to ward off migraines. States it is in a white bottle, but a pharmacy bottle from (Pharmacy name). She provides discard after 18May2021. Now clarifies it is Topiramate, the generic, 50 mg, it helps ward off migraines. She sees a neurologist for this, not by her internist, she sees the internist who prescribes it twice a year, actually, it is so her headaches don&#39;t turn into a migraine, this is just a worse headache, she doesn&#39;t know what this is from, hopefully it will just get better. The patient previously took codeine and experienced drug allergy. It was reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday, 06Jan2021. Patient reported that &#34;she&#39;s a headache person and gets them all the time.&#34; Per the reporter, late yesterday on 10Jan2021, she got a really, really bad headache, that she still have. Could this be vaccine related this far out? The only thing she got right after the vaccine was a sore arm. It&#39;s not debilitating (the headache). She is going through a few stressful situations with a friend and her son going through a divorce. She do have a lung condition that&#39;s now in remission. She was being followed by a pulmonologist and she is taking something. She is allergic to codeine. She will continue to take Tylenol and will continue to just deal with it.&#34; She said that her husband believes the current headache is related to stress. It was further reported that she got the vaccine last Wednesday, on 06Jan2021, she is a headache person, she gets headaches all the time, and takes Topamax (later clarified as the generic, topiramate) on a daily basis, but yesterday on 10Jan2021, late afternoon, she got a really really bad headache, that is still there today, but she didn&#39;t get it right after the vaccine, she wondered is that related, or would she have gotten it right away, the headache? States it is not horrible bad, it&#39;s just a bad headache, she still wants the second vaccine, and she doesn&#39;t want this to interfere, she has a lot of medical conditions, this is why she was afraid to call. Her husband doesn&#39;t think this has to do with the vaccine, but she felt like, let her just call. She still has it (headache), she is a headache person, it got better then she got it again, and it also could be stress related, she has been dealing with a few things: she has a friend giving stress, her son is going through a divorce. But she did not get it right after the vaccine, the vaccine was early Wednesday, which is why her husband doesn&#39;t think it has to so with anything. Also, she has a lung problem, and thank god she is in remission, she has sarcoidosis, and she has immune system problems, so she has medical reasons. But the issues most important are the lung. She is having blood work done tomorrow, so it has nothing to do with it. States this is good to tell about the stress: she has a friend, a toxic friend, she lives in (State Name), the friend lives in (City Name), and she is a negative person, and she is ending a longstanding friendship, which is not like her, so that is weighing on her mind, and that is, could be, adding to it, and even hurts a little, that&#39;s stress, but since she had the vaccine, she thought to call and see. She can definitely get the second dose, right? This report doesn&#39;t affect her getting the second dose? After reviewing the call recording, there is no mention of the friend getting the vaccine. The reporter said her friend is giving her stress, and in regards to the statement &#34;weighing on her mind, and that is, could be, adding to it, and even hurts a little, that&#39;s stress, but since she had the vaccine&#34;, the reporter was referring to herself. Additionally, the statement &#34;But she did not get it right after the vaccine, the vaccine was early Wednesday&#34; the reporter was also referring to herself. The outcome of the event &#39;headache&#39; was not recovered while unknown for the other event.

Dr., my internist, agrees that what happened was not a vasovagal syncope (hospital?s diagnosis).   My Experience: Within say 7 minutes of the injection I felt woozy, the wooziness intensified, I got intense pins and needles in my lower legs, fore arms and hands, and less so in my face. My speech became very slowed down, slurred  and I had a lot of difficulty forming words. It was as if I was extremely drunk. After they called the paramedics, I was not able to get myself out of my car or walk.  I lost motor coordination/control in hands and feet.  I was cold, never felt faint, and had slightly evaluated blood pressure for me( normal is 110/64 paramedics got it at 152/94).

                                                On Christmas day I was working and then you started feeling like a pinching in my chest, like when you are going to catch a cold, that went on through the afternoon. In the afternoon I started with light headache and dry cough (intermittent), no temperature. I did not take anything for it and continued working. When I got home, I felt weak and was supposed to join my family for Christmas and decided not to go. And went to sleep. The next day (Sat) I was still not feeling well, weakness on my limbs, I went to the hospital to see if I could get checked and they told me to return on Monday because Occupational Health was closed on the weekends. I went home and treated myself with Tylenol and Vitamin C. On Monday I got tested and was positive. By then, I was coughing, limbs weak, had temperature (101F).  I started to get weaker an weaker and Tuesday or Wednesday my work called me and asked me if I would like to come see a doctor. Wednesday I started with shortness of breath. I called my PCP and he prescribed me an albuterol inhaler. It helped me but my cough got worse by Saturday. My doctor then told me to go to the hospital (I live by myself).  At my choice I went to Medical Center and were admitted and was hospitalized for 6 days.  They kept treating me with inhaler and oxygen. They wanted to send me to rehab but I told them I wanted to go home. I came home with oxygen and with albuterol inhaler and the ambulance had to bring me home. I still was feeling very weak, had cough, and had the shortness of breath. And I have been home since then. I have home health and a therapist that come check on me 2X a weekly.

At 3:00 a.m. I was dizzy and had uncontrollable shaking over entire body for approximately 45 minutes. The nausea continued throughout the entire day on 2/19/21.  I contacted the Department of Health today, but whomever I spoke to did not seem interesed in hearing about it and did not ask any questions or for any information.

                                                Blurred vision, benign vertigo, immediately after vaccine given.  Corrected itself over the next hour. But at 4:30 am  2/22/2021 I was awakened by intense  itching on my left arm and hand.  Over the next 2 hours the itching increased in intensity and progressed to my right arm and hand, over my upper back and shoulders, and along the back of my thighs and buttocks.        I took 2 Benadryl allergy tablets (25mg) and used Benadryl GEL extra strength on the affected areas.  This resulted in my sleepiness for the remainder of the day. Contacted my physicians office for an appointment to resolve the issue.

                                                I received the 2nd Covid injection.  I went to the 15-minute waiting area.  The waiting area was full, so my husband and I were standing.  I stand and work every day, so this was not difficult.  I texted my daughter, who is a hospital employee, and told her that we had a super experience with no wait and had already received our 2nd dose.  However, 5 to 7 minutes after the injection, I SUDDENLY felt dizzy and weak and had to sit down.  Within a minute or so, I could not stand or open my eyes.  The weakness made it difficult to breath or talk.  My husband had to lift me up into a wheelchair.  I was taken to the ER.  For the longest time, I could not even open my eyes or talk above a whisper. After 4 hours, I was able to get my eyes open and talk better.  I, gradually, was able to move my hands and feet.  Last of all, I could move my hips and walk.   It was as if my body had been put to sleep.  I could feel everything but my body wouldn?t move.  As it wore off, my face and limbs felt slightly tingly.  I was, basically, fine after 5 hours other than being tired from the experience. The doctors had no explanation for what happened and said it must be an emotional response to getting the shot.  They wrote that I was not exerting enough effort to move my body.  One said that I was hyperventilating when I pulled my mask up to breathe after he told me to hold my leg in the air.  Though I tried, I was too weak to hold my leg up and it fell to the bed. The doctor told me that I should not tell anyone about what had happened or people would not come to get the Covid vaccination.  He obviously knew that SOMETHING had happened that I couldn&#39;t control but he didn&#39;t put that in his report!

                                                Note: this was a POSITIVE effect worthy of study! I was resigned to being a long hauler after 8 werks of 100 degree fever and fatigue, but on 3rd day after first Pfizer vaccine, I woke up totally symptoms free. Did the vaccine give me something my body couldn?t produce, or just push my immune system to kick out a new round of fresh antibodies?    This could be extra good news for longhaulers.  Should be studied.....

A 67-year-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: el 3247), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose (at the age of 67-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was administered in a public health clinic/administration facility. Medical history included asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure and anxiety. The patient had unspecified concomitant therapy. The patient preciously took enalapril and sulfur and experienced drug allergies: &#34;Allergies to medications, food, or other products: Sulfur, Enalapril&#34;. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Jan2021 at 21:30, the patient experienced severe abdomen pain, abdomen swelling, chills, nausea, vomiting and elevated transaminase measurement. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received unspecified treatment for the adverse events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures in 2021 which included CT scan, comprehensive metabolic, Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (Rapd) and ultrasound all with unknown results; on 30Jan2021 elevated transaminase; and on 31Jan2021 a negative nasal swab (SARS-CoV-2 test). The events were considered non-serious by the reporter: not resulted in death, not life threatening, did not cause or prolong hospital, not disabling/incapacitating and not a congenital anomaly/birth defect. The patient has not recovered from the events.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea. Feeling unwell- she would say from 23Jan2021 to the present she has not felt normal on 22Jan2021, it comes and goes She has not had swollen lymph nodes. Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

She immediately began noticing that the words on her TV screen were not legible - her vision had become blurry. This blurriness was accompanied by severe eye pain and pain in the temples of her head. When shutting eyes and keeping them closed for a few hours, the blurriness would subside. However she continues to experience this blurriness &#39;on and off&#39; to date. Also experienced some mild headaches but they have subsided as of two days ago. Hasn&#39;t taken anything to alleviate the symptoms. Patient is extremely concerned that she may permanently lose vision and refuses to get 2nd dose.

She was a little concerned because she heard that if you had a reaction or side effects to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that they would be worse with the second dose. She had abdominal cramps all night long off and on. She reported outcome as ongoing but a little bit better. She did better if she just stays still.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

Then after initial dose on the second day after first injection, I began with chills, headache, fatigue, body aches. By the second day after initial dose,  I began with mucus cough and same symptoms with chills, headache, fatigue and body aches. I took Tylenol, cold and cough medication. It is the third day after injection, symptoms same, but slightly better, still extreme fatigue and body aches and chills and I took an Proventyl inhaler as needed. Note, I do not take Proventyl inhaler on a regular basis, I just felt the need as I was beginning to have a lot of bronchial mucus. The inhaler seems to help. I am waiting it out and did not contact my family physicians. I am hoping I will feel better soon. Still taking OTC medications and Tylenol, fluids and rest.

Body was so sore that I had to take med to sleep.  It is early Friday morning now and I have been so tired and hurting that I have slept most of the week (4 days).   I don&#39;t often take immunizations as they kick in my rheumatic/psoriatic arthritis so badly and I hurt so badly and can&#39;t do anything. I was hoping that this immunization would be different as it&#39;s action is supposed to be different.  I am still planning on getting the second shot as it is so important:especially due to my age and other conditions.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

                                                Patient is a 68yo female with a PMH s/f of osteoarthritis, CHF, TIA with right limb weakness and aphasia and HTN presenting with a 1 week history of bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness. Patient states that she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/14 last week at pharmacy. At the time of inoculation, she did not experience any symptoms and went home after the 15 minute waiting period. The next day, she developed a generalized headache that started in her neck and continued over her head. She states that this continued to get worse throughout the day and on Saturday, she woke up and described a constant, 10/10, dull-aching pain that started at her neck/back of head and extended down to her shoulders to the tips of her fingers. She also stated that she had the same pain starting around her groin extending down to her knees and ankles. Patient initially tried taking Tylenol and ibuprofen to treat the pain, and said that those treatments normally work for her osteoarthritis, but that her pain did not improve afterwards.  In addition to the pain, she also states that she developed worsening weakness to the point where she could not walk around her home. She stated that she thought moving around and being active had helped her fight through the pain and tolerate it, but that laying down and resting actually seemed to make it worse.  With her symptoms worsening and her inability to walk, she decided to come to the hospital to get further treatment. She denied ever having an adverse reaction to other vaccines she has received previously. She receives the flu vaccine every year, and received measles, polio and other childhood vaccinations that she could not recall. She was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica and started on 20mg prednisone daily. She had a remarkable response to the steroids and her symptoms resolved within 24 hours. She was discharged on her 3rd day of admission.   On ROS, she denies fevers, chills, night sweats, SOB, changes to vision, eye pain, cough, chest pain, sputum production, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dysuria or hematuria. She affirmed weight loss, headache, neck stiffness, dizziness, lightheadedness, muscle stiffness/pain, reduced ROM, and urinary urgency and incontinence.

                                                The only reaction I had with the first vaccine on 12/18/20  was fatigue the second day following the vaccination.  12/18/20.   On 12/2820  I developed a deep cough and a temperature of 100.6.  I tested positive for Covid.    I quarantined for 10 days and was ill for approximately 5 of those days.  I contacted my pulmonologist who researched the data and determined if I was afebrile and did not have body aches and was feeling ok I could take 2nd vaccine.  If not I should wait a week.  Since I was not experiencing S&amp;S of Covid and felt fine I took 2nd vaccine on 1/8/2021.   Late the night of the injection 1/8/2021  I developed a deep consistant cough, a temp of 100.2, chills, headache, and fatigue.   By the second day my temp was 99.8 , cough was unchanged and fatigue was unrelenting.  My temp continued to decrease with time until I was afebrile the week of the 18th.  By the 22nd  the fatigue was much improved and the cough was not as persistent. Today, 1/25/2021  my only complaint is the deep cough .

This 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 12Jan2021 13:30 on Arm Left at single dose (lot: EK9231, Expiry: 30Apr2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Give her a follow up appointment for a second dose, that will be 02 Feb at 1:20 PM. Medical History included arthritis and had surgery for right knee replacement 6 years ago (2015). They are trying to figure out, she has water in her ear she has had CT scans recently trying to check for any problems that could be corrected surgically and that was all clean. She has had a mammogram, she was not sure about the mammogram yet but she thinks they would have called her if there was a problem with that. Historical vaccine included Just mild stuff with the flu vaccine for immunisation on occasion she has had similar reactions that were very mild with the flu vaccine and last year she had none of that at all. She says when she has had any other vaccine, she had no reaction other than maybe a slightly sore arm. No other products. She did have some mild side effects. She was really glad she got this shot. She said she had experienced some chilling on 13Jan2021, these are all very mild symptoms. She had a sore throat on 13Jan2021, some aching, like body aches on 13Jan2021 and joint tenderness on 13Jan2021. She just got chilled every once in a while. It was not very bad. She said the sore throat had persisted about the same, but the coffee helped. She was having some swelling at the injection site that was about the same as when it began on 13Jan2021. She was having some arm tenderness on 13Jan2021. She did not have any adverse reactions yesterday (12Jan2021) she was so excited to get it. Outcome of the events was not recovered.

The patient states her symptoms started 3-4 days prior to presentation. She admits to cough, nausea, and an episode of vomiting the day of presentation. She had been intermittently using her husband&#39;s oxygen prior to presentation which she says has helped with her symptoms, but does not use oxygen at baseline. Upon presentation the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation rate on room air is 89%. Patient was placed on 2L oxygen via nasal cannula and then was saturating in the mid 90s. CXR demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates in the ED which the ED physician felt to be consistent with COVID infection. The patient&#39;s rapid COVID test resulted as positive. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management of hypoxia related to COVID infection. The patient remains hospitalized on the day of report submission (1/28/21)

A 68-year-old female (not pregnant) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 14Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), previous TIA (Transient ischemic attack) with some residual right sided weakness, CHF (congestive heart failure), osteoarthritis. Had a childhood vaccination history. No Known allergies. Concomitant medications included albuterol, aspirin, atorvastatin, fluticasone, furosemide, hydralazine, ibuprofen, lisinopril, metoprolol, multivitamin, all above were in two weeks (as of 25Jan2021). The patient previously received influenza vaccine yearly, and received her pneumonia vaccines over the last several years, both for immunization and never had a reaction to a vaccine. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. No other vaccine received in four weeks. The patient developed a dull headache on 15Jan2021, one date after the vaccine, but that it resolved after 24 hours on 16Jan2021. On 16Jan2021 at 8:00 AM, the patient developed bilateral proximal muscle stiffness, weakness, and pain in her upper and lower extremities over the course of 1 week. The patient started experiencing this bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, stiffness and weakness beginning at the shoulders and hips and extending distally over several days. Her symptoms started out relatively mild and progressively got worse over the course of 7 days. She presented to the reporting healthcare professional 8 days after her vaccination and she was extremely weak and could not support herself to walk around in her home, the reporting healthcare professional suspect polymyalgia rheumatica. All the events (except dull headache) resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization. The patient was hospitalization due to all the above events for 3 days. The patient had a remarkable response to the treatment of prednisone during her hospitalization. It was unknown if covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included COVID tested (COVID test type: Nasal Swab, SARS-COVID19 PCR) post vaccination on 23Jan2021: Negative. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 16Jan2021 and all the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   Information about lot/batch number was requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded, considering the temporal relationship.  However, it is worth noting that the 68-year-old female patient had pre-existing osteoarthritis, which could be one of the causes of joint symptoms.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                arm soreness; community acquired pneumonia; COPD; shortness of breath; chest congestion; weakness; fatigue; Muscle aches and pains; she became ill; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse from a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

By the next morning no more chills and temp 97.6.  I do have a lingering headache on both sides of my head which meanders down my neck. The site of the injection is still sore and seems to have moved 3 inches down my arm. And there is also a lingering phlegm problem building up at the back of my throat.

                                                About four days after the shot  I started having a  runny nose and a cough with lots of clear mucus from both. Then it went down to my lungs and my lungs really hurt . I do have asthma so maybe that?s a part of it? It just seems strange that I was coughing so much and gave me a headache. Then about six days later I got an attack of IBS. I haven?t had an attack  like that for two years. Maybe it?s all a coincidence? Also about 3-4 days after shot I had a herpes outbreak.

Patient previously got her flu and shingles shot at the end of &#34;October&#34;. Patient took the vaccine last Friday (29Jan2021) at the age of 68 years old (reported as &#34;68 and a half&#34;). She does not know if that makes a &#34;different&#34; but her right arm felt like it was going to fall off it hurt so bad, on a scale of 1-10 it was about a 20. It was really tender she put a heating pad on it, she has been sleeping on the heating pad and it was mild now. It was only about a 3 now and it has come down, but it hurt like the dickens. Also she has ran a temperature and that finally broke but the highest was 102.4. Patient has slept around the clock and she has not been out of bed but like 30 minutes out of the last 24 hours (hrs) just to go the potty or drink something. Patient stated &#34;almost gave up holding it was so long&#34;. She has been so weak she has not been out of bed hardly. Patient said that she has eaten since, &#34;lets see Saturday night, Sunday, Monday&#34;. Patient has not eaten since Saturday night (30Jan2021) or gotten out of bed. She has not eaten anything. Patient has had COVID and recovered so she did not want to catch that again. She confirmed that she had COVID prior to received the vaccine. She called her primary care and she has a viral phone call tomorrow or visual phone call, whatever its called, she was trying to get over this mess, she feels warm, she was not registering a temperature right now but she had a cold sweat or something right now (01Feb2021). Patient has a call with him tomorrow so he will know about this incase Pfizer calls. Patient stated that she knows with a normal vaccine she might have an ache or something but this one hurt bad, maybe they pushed it in too hard or something she does not know. When asked for vaccination facility type, the patient answered that they had a vaccine clinic they had set up there in a conference room, they had an elaborate set up, go through certain places and there were several steps. Vaccine was not administered at facility (reported as &#34;No hospital&#34;). Patient further reported that her arm on 29Jan2021 (Friday evening) was tender.

When asked for adverse events prior vaccinations, the patient answered &#34;no none that she can remember. Sometimes she will have a sore arm that is why she gets it in the right arm because she is left handed thinkin her dominant hand will not have any problems but this one hurt really bad. Have they had many calls where this is really effecting arms really bad?&#34;. Patient also reported that her sister had the shot the same day and her arm was a little sore but that was all, she does not have NDC lot expiration for her sisters dose of the vaccine. She went to a different facility in a different location. Outcome of &#34;her right arm felt like it was going to fall off it hurt so bad&#34; was recovering, while for other events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 68 y/o female who enrolled in program on 9/19/2018 who began monotherapy treatment with Pioglitazone 15mg PO on 10/5/2018. Patient called study team stating that she received her second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination on 02/19/21.  Afterwards, she had a sore arm and slept most of the next day.  On 02/21/21, she experienced severe right-sided leg weakness and fell while attempting to go to the bathroom.  She was unable to ambulate and her son took her to the emergency room. She was hospitalized overnight for a serious adverse reaction to the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.  Multiple sclerosis exacerbation was ruled out after extensive testing. Then, she was transferred a Rehab facility on 02/22/21 for physical therapy and occupational therapy.  She continues study medication without any missed doses.  She will most likely be in Rehab for another week.  She was able to walk 80 feet on 2/25/2021 with a walker and gait belt and ambulatory assistance. This is unrelated to study drug. We consider this to be a Non-UP SAE.  As of 3/4/2021 the patient is still in rehab.

A 68-year-old female patient the second dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN5318) on 04Feb2021 at 1:00 on Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history was ongoing Arachnoiditis (this is a spinal cord disease). Concomitant drugs were not reported. Historical Vaccine was 1st dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL1283) on 15Jan2021 administered in left arm for covid-19 immunization. She was calling to report a severe reaction that occurred after the second injection. On 05Feb2021 she started to have extreme chills with teeth chattering at 3 AM. She knew this could be part of the symptoms. At 6 AM on 05Feb2021 she got up and with her husband&#39;s assessment who is also is a doctor it was determined by her husband she was in a cytokine storm that attacked her spinal cord disease. The extreme chills ended within a couple of hours on 05Feb2021. The cytokine storm has pretty much resolved. It is still there, but better. She still has fatigue. However, the extreme pain, mental fog, and disconnect that came with it has all subsided. Caller stated she knows from research and talking to other people most people might have the chills after the COVID Vaccine. The chills is not the severe side effect she is referencing as severe. The Cytokine storm reaction for her wit her spinal cord disease is unexpected and not normal. This was the severe event. No Emergency Room visited. Physician&#39;s Office visited for Cytokine Storm. She should have gone to the hospital, but she did not want to go. Seven days after event started, she went to her physician. This was as soon as she was able to get up and get out of the house. Treatment was mainly self-treating. Her husband is a doctor and they did what they needed to do at home. These side effects were pretty horrific. Outcome of the event cytokine storm was recovering, for fatigue was not recovered, for other events was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected.

The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back.

She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck.

She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses.

ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

The belief was that our illness was uncomplicated and we were sent home with instructions to monitor our symptoms.  On 03/14/2021, I took her to the hospital because her condition was worsening.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Lot  EJ1686, intramuscular in right deltoid on 03Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive other vaccine within four weeks.  On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced sore arm and tiredness.  On 07Jan2021 the patient experienced anterior cervical fusion and was hospitalized from 07Jan2021 to 09Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced nausea. On 09Jan2021 the patient experienced muscle aches, loss of taste and loss of smell. On unknown date the patient experienced headache. The patient was tested positive to COVID-19 on 11Jan2021. The patient did not visit Physician Office or Emergency Room. Laboratory data included COVID-19 Rapid Test positive on 11Jan2021. The outcome of the events tested positive for COVID-19, and anterior cervical fusion was unknown. The outcome of the events sore arm, tiredness, nausea, muscle aches, headache was resolving. The outcome of the events loss of taste, loss of smell was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 03Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 11Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  This 69-year-old female had medical history of ongoing essential tremor started in her 50&#39;s.  The reported anterior cervical fusion was most likely due to concurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the vaccine of BNT162B2.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I became weak and thought I was going to faint. I called the medical professional over and they brought me into a staged area for triage. My blood pressure was 171/ 104 or 114. I had chest pain. The EMT did and EKG, listened to my heart, and started an IV. The ambulance was called and I was transported by ambulance to the hospital. At the hospital another EKG was taken, blood pressure and blood work. Repeated blood work was taken. I was admitted to the hospital due to elevation of tyoponin level and chest pain. The following day 1/22/21 I saw my PCP and he thought it was related to the vaccine and recommended a cardiologist for the increased levels of tyoponin and chest pain.  The cardiologist performed another EKG&lt; more blood work and performed a cardiac catheterization and a ECO. Both were normal. Prior to that I was given a nitro pill as my chest pain was between a 7 and a 8; a few minutes later the nurse asked about my pain level and it was a 3-4. I was given another nitro pill and shortly after I felt extremely faint and my blood pressure was 56/32. I was immediately given a bolus of saline IV . The chest pain continued through the day. The following day, I had no further chest pain, my tyoponin levels returned to normal and I was released from the hospital.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

                                                body aches increased; headache worse; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID vaccine due to the patient&#39;s age and lives in continued care retirement community. Medical history included ongoing pain and ongoing persistent headaches, both since 2009. Concomitant medication included erenumab aooe (AIMOVIG) from an unspecified date in 2020 (started taking it 3 months ago). The patient reported side effect from the vaccine received on 08Jan2021. She has had body aches and headaches since 2009, so she figured after reading about the side effects, she would probably have worse body and headaches, but the body aches lasted maybe 4-5 days, from the time of vaccination, she has what was called new daily persistent headaches, which was a rare form of headache. They didn&#39;t have meds for it, because not many people have it, it was not a money maker to try to find something that works. She figured this would make headache worse and that was what it did, they were normally a level 7 or 8 on an unspecified date, and they increased to a level 9 on Jan2021, and she couldn&#39;t find a way to get it back down. The patient called her headache specialist and she thought steroid injections might help but wanted her to talk to someone to let them know the side effect the patient was having, with the headaches. Her body aches never go away, headaches never go away, and the day of the vaccine, she still had them both as normal, but after receiving the vaccine, her body aches increased, they went up a level, they were normally, a level 7 on an unspecified date, and after the vaccine, they went up to an 8.5 on Jan2021. She took Tylenol, regularly, every 4 to 6 hours, and after about 4 days, the body aches were down to the normal ache. But, the headache did not. The headache was starting to get worse. The outcome of the event body aches increased was recovering while the other event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 14Jan2021 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included left hip replaced on 16Nov2020 and had her right hip replaced on 29Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported that she got the shot at 1:30 pm and on the way home she started getting tired and exhausted on 14Jan2021. She got home and went right to bed. She felt like she couldn&#39;t stay awake, fell asleep and woke up about 6 pm then with a temperature of 105.5 and stated it would fluctuate between 104-105. She was just feeling horrible. At 7:30 pm, patient had a temperature of 103.5 and at 7:45 pm, her temperature was 104. On 14Jan2021, patient stated that she couldn&#39;t see straight, had blurred vision, having trouble walking, her balance was off and falling into walls. Her body was jerking and the arm that she got the injection in was dropping. Patient called her cardiology office, and was advised to take Tylenol 3-4 times per day and alternate it with Motrin. She was also taking coated 325 mg aspirin. She can hold her head up and was not jerking as much as she was. She was doing noticeably better. Patient had put ice bags on her groin, stomach and throat to try to cool down through the night. This brought temperature down to 103. She woke up at 12 am she was 102. Her temperature at the time of report was around 101-102. She took her blood pressure it was going crazy, first it was up around 163/71 and then over time it was really low 118/58 and heart rate was 130 for a while and went to 103. The back of her neck still felt so weak and she still feels extremely weak and exhausted. She went on to report that her HR was high and B/P was up but since then it has come down. The night of 14Jan2021, her b/p was low.On 14Jan2021, patient was also real thirsty and her urine was darker and was probably dehydrated and thought that she was real jerky muscle-wise, like she is not in control of anything last night. That she has not taken BP or heart rate on 15Jan2021, but it was not pounding today though. She was doing better today at the time of report. Patient was recovering from the events of fever, blurred vision, and balance was off; not recovered from tired, jerking, and dehydration. Outcome of remaining events was unknown.

                                                I give the girl in front of me the Covid vaccine way high on her arm. I told MA do not give my shot that high up. She said in a snide voice it?s still the deltoid and she shot my bursa. The evening of the shot I started having severe arm pain and nausea. The next morning I had right scapula rib pain it was hard to breathe my arm hurt very bad I can hardly lift it I went to work. When I got to work I couldn?t function I was so nauseated with the pain I went home that day and I?ve missed three days total from that event of wrong injection site. The pain has gotten worse I can?t lift my arm left right upper down without pain and it?s going into my neck and down to my elbow now I went to the occupational medical doctor. I told him what happened and he said she gave me the shot am I supraspinatus Bursa and I have an injury to my bursa. I came back for a second visit the next week and he said I have bursitis from that now I can?t raise and use my arm that well at all and I have severe pain 24 seven still and he sent me to a physical therapist starting today 2 to 21. It has gotten worse and my shoulder has locked up three times. I still have ongoing pain 24 seven and I want to report a complaint against the girl who gave my shot I thought she was an LPN but she is a MA.  We both work at healthcare clinic. I am a 26 year RN and she did not listen to me and she stuck me anyway against my will.

                                                Started within 2 hours of vaccine (8 pm) an extremely sore arm.  Then the pain started to radiate to my shoulder.  By the next day, it was really painful in my shoulder and across my back almost to my backbone.  It was painful to move my arm up or down or to reach for things. This lasted 3 to 4 days.  Then my neck on the same side as the shot (left) began to hurt so badly I couldn&#39;t move my neck up or down or sideways.  It was strange the way the pain slowly moved across by arm to my shoulder to my back and up my neck.  I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before.   Today my pain in my neck is bearable but I have soreness and a headache.  I hope I am at the end of the cycle to this event as I am scheduled for my next shot soon.

A 69-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in the left shoulder area on 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COPD (has it for lots of years) and nickel sensitivity. She does not have any reactions to her previous unspecified vaccines but had a normal reaction like sore arm. Concomitant medication included bimatoprost (LUMIGAN).  The patient previously received flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, both for immunization in 2020 around the end of Sep or beginning of Oct. The patient reported side effects regarding the COVID vaccine and said she was a little confused and unsure if she was having a problem or if she should see a doctor. On 16Jan2021 at 11:15 AM, she had the first dose of the COVID vaccine and afterward she had a lot of effects which were mostly muscle and body aches in Jan2021. She also experienced some ongoing congestion in one nostril but saw this as just more congestion and that she was having to blow her nose more in Jan2021. She did the (app name) report but didn&#39;t report the stuffiness. She did report that in the first few days she felt like she was having the onset of pneumonia and felt tired and run down (Jan2021). Two days ago, she started feeling itchy (Jan2021) and she didn&#39;t know what it was, she didn&#39;t know if she ate something or what. Now she has developed a rash (Jan2021) which is ongoing until now. Her paperwork said the rash would happen right away if it was caused by the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if this is something she should be concerned about and if the rash could appear or started this long after she had the vaccine. Her second dose is due on 06Feb2021. The patient wanted to know if the vaccine contains nickel or any metal substances in it since she had compared her rash to her nickel sensitivity. The patient wanted to know if rash is a side effect from the vaccine and how long it will last. She didn&#39;t put rash down for the safety check either as she didn&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine. Today her rash, she is so itchy. She does have it on her neck and certain areas but not everywhere. It looks like what would happen after a bad fever. It is not raised but is like a fever type rash.  She did note that she had an increase dose of a medication eye drops (Lumigan; Lot: T and a 0 or O followed by 544, and NDC: 0023320503. Expiry: Jan2022) around the time the rash started but after getting the vaccine. Her head, neck and back are very itchy. She mentioned that she waited 2 days and did not put this event in the (app name). She would have reported it yesterday, but she didn&#39;t get one yesterday. She also noted that it was very dry there and cold and a person is going to get dry skin.  She does have an allergic to metal and wondered if that was in the product. In her neck area, it looks just like when she would wear a cheap necklace. No treatments received. The events did not require emergency room or physician office visit.  The patient has no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient had not yet recovered from events rash/like a fever type rash and congestion in one nostril/stuffiness; while unknown outcome for the remaining events.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine was not administered in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing ulcerative colitis, ongoing high cholesterol,  ongoing high blood pressure, celiac disease from 2005 (this has been tested too many times to count and it has been negative since after initial diagnosis 2005), arthritis (all her life) ongoing, hip replacement surgeries first done in 2005; repair of same hip in 2015; other hip in 2017. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Historical vaccines include Pneumonia Vaccine, Shingles Vaccine and Flu vaccines; all on an unspecified date for immunization. She never had adverse events with those. Ongoing concomitant medications included rosuvastatin (5 mg tablet) for high cholesterol, mesalamine (400 mg capsule) for ulcerative colitis and lisinopril from 2018 for high blood pressure. According to the patient, she knows that mesalamine is an immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory to keep inflammation in the colon down. This consumer was administered her first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 12Jan2021 14:30 with immunosuppressant mesalamine.

It was a rolling week of agony after that with one adverse event after another until she ended up in the emergency room on 16Jan2021 because she was so dehydrated and was really sick. She was not admitted to the hospital related to any of these events; but while in the emergency room she was given intravenous fluids; a chest x-ray; blood work; after maybe 5-6 hours she was sent home; she was also given a COVID test which was negative; and then 2 days later took another COVID test which was also negative. Both COVID tests were Rapid Tests: on 16Jan2021 and 18Jan2021. On the Chest xray they suggested she had some sinus tachycardia which is just a rapid heartbeat and not surprising; nothing else showed up on Chest x-ray; as far as anything else testing/results wise there was only some facetious blood work which they just said to follow-up with her PCP regarding but nothing really out of the ordinary. She can finally out of bed on a regular basis for a couple of hours daily; she is still very fatigued; she has no muscle pain, neck aches or body aches at this time; she does not have the strength she should have; is no longer experiencing headaches or fever; but is extremely tired. She will fall asleep through the day for 3-4 hours at a time and she does not even nap usually (Jan2021). She has not driven yet but assumes probably once she is a little stronger she will be able to drive again. She did not have upper respiratory, chest or cough issues. The outcome of the events fever, headache, body ache, muscle pain, neck ache was recovered on Jan2021; fatigue was not recovered. The outcome for the other events was unknown.

I had to rest all day. I lost my appetite. Anytime I got up to go to the bathroom, I had to hold something to walk. I also had a mild headache. I felt better on Sunday.  My arm was still a little sore as of yesterday but it is better today.

                                                chills; fever; body aches; headache; vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via a Pfizer sponsored program. A 69-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a sngle dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She mentioned that she received the vaccine on Sunday (unknown date) and reported that for the last 4 days she had been pretty sick with fever, chills, headache and body aches. She had been alternating acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (ADVIL). She did have COVID in Nov2020. The patient inquired if the symptoms after dose 2 would be worse if she&#39;s had COVID in the past. She also inquired if she will have the same symptoms for the second dose and if how long side effects will last. She add that she did have some vomiting on Sunday later after she got the vaccine. She was wondering because she is to get the second dose on the 21st, the pharmacist did say that sometimes people who have had the Covid virus already can sometimes experience strong side effects from the vaccine. She does not want to feel or get sick. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Very lethargic which I understand is normal. I was concerned about the one sided headache. Was on the left side of my head. The shot was in left arm. Have not idea if that would make a difference.

                                                She got the vaccine which was fine, at the end of the 20 minute waiting period had a spot the size of a dime, really sore and pink.  On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

A nurse practitioner and a doctor came over and sat with her; she got some water and she was okay.

She does have an IV contrast reaction, and some other things, nothing she knew was in the vaccine, she was fine and wasn&#39;t worried that she was aware of. She thinks she got too hot, she had on a coat, she was sitting and panning through stuff, reading on her phone, and all of a sudden she had terrible lightheadedness, she never fainted in her life, she is pretty sturdy, she didn&#39;t know what to think, she was lightheaded, and it was not vertigo, not like the room was flying, but she was like out of balance, her balance was messed up, and she sat there a minute, she was too hot, she got out of her coat, and it got worse, she could feel her heart racing, and she was talking to herself, she thinks she nervous, she could feel her heart pounding, and was instructed to raise her hand if she had issues, so she raised her hand, a nurse practitioner came over, she raised her hand, and the doctor making rounds came over and he said take off your mask off, she did, that helped somewhat, it was that blasted mask, she couldn&#39;t get enough air, he gave her water, she thinks she got too hot and perhaps got nervous and didn&#39;t think she was she said she&#39;s not been around people, and was suddenly in a huge crowd, everyone was appropriately distanced, it was an extreme presentation, after 5-6 minutes, she was good, it went away, but for 36 hours she didn&#39;t feel right, she could feel sometimes her balance wasn&#39;t right, she was just not herself, she could do her usual, she lives on a farm, she did usual farm stuff, but was not herself, and in the night, she woke several times, her heart was beating too fast, too much, but she went back to sleep, and she told her son, she said it felt like she had had 4-5 cups of really strong coffee. So the next day she was ok. Absolutely her normal, and then she didn&#39;t think anything about it, and was driving to a routine GYN exam, which was canceled last moment due to an emergency, she was driving and suddenly her arm started itching, this was Tuesday, so 48 hours after, not the site, it was distal, underneath it, maybe 2-3 inches under injection site. The site did nothing, she looked that night, no redness, lump, no raised area, no warmth, nothing, but then she had itching, intense itching like poison ivy, and she scratched and thought wait a minute, at her appointment she looked at her arm, this area was 3-4inches under the site, that was red, feathery looking and flat, macular, not raised, no induration, no warmth, no lump, no pain, it was feathery dusty red and the next day it was gone, she did nothing to it, she thought to put hydrocortisone, and looked at it, but it was so faint and wasn&#39;t itching.

A 69-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s wife) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot: EN5318) on 12Feb2021 on right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes diagnosed about 30 years prior. Concomitant medications were none. Patient got the 1st dose of bnt162b2 and 4 hours after getting it, her blood sugar went down to 25 (12Feb2021) and she became almost non-responsive. She took a lot of carbohydrates after the shot before she plummeted. Reporter asked if there had been any reports of this and should she take the 2nd shot. Reporter said that he is reporting the side effect of that approximately 4 hours after receiving the shot, which his wife is diabetic, she was tired and then her sugar dropped to 25 before he realized she had an issue. He says she was nearly totally nonresponsive (12Feb2021). He said this was very abnormal and her sugar has never been that low. He said after he realized her sugar dropped to 25, he got some ice cream into her and then some (brand name withheld), then he got her blood sugar which the next reading was 47, then the third reading was mid 90s, so then he took her to the emergency room and they ran tests. He says by then her blood sugar was 250-280, which they thought was good after it had been that low. He says that they did blood tests and did not find anything abnormal, and her blood sugar has been good since then. He said she was not admitted to the hospital, and they went home that night. He said that this had never occurred before, period. Reporter said that everything seems to be normal at this point, though it scared them. He said his wife has not gotten the second dose yet, and they have questioned if she should take the second dose since this happened, and he was wondering if Pfizer may have advice to provide them on getting the second dose for her. The outcome of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

She said her wrist, elbows, fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient; retired nurse) via a Pfizer-sponsored program.  A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 10Feb2021 at 12:35 PM (at age of 69 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a convention center. The patient&#39;s medical history included eczema from 24Dec2018 and ongoing, rosacea (developed Rosacea at 65 years old), and the patient also reported that she used to be 5&#39;4&#34; and she lost 2 inches. She said she had a bone density test recently and was told she is 5&#39;2&#34;. She said she objected to the measurement of 5&#39;2&#34;, so the nurse told her to stand as tall as she can, and then the nurse noted her height as 5&#39;2-1/2&#34;. There were no concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 12Feb2021, the patient experienced eczema flare up, skin red, her left anterior chest was burning and itchy, headache, skin pain, and &#34;joint pain that was so bad, she thought she was going to die. She said her wrist, elbows. fingers, hips, knees, every joint down to her ankles, hurt&#34;.  The patient said she received her first COVID-19 Vaccine on 10Feb2021. She said everything was fine after she received her COVID-19 Vaccine. She didn&#39;t even have a mark on her arm where she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. The patient reported that she got the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Feb2021 and is due to the second dose on 03Mar2021. Approximately 2 and half days later she got an eczema flare that was quite severe out of the blue since she was having eczema diagnosed since she was 67 (as reported; she is 69 today). She still has some itching and burning and she wondered if this was something that has been reported also for other psoriasis/eczema patients. She was concerned about taking the second dose since she thinks this may be caused by the vaccine as she stated that nothing has changed in her life aside the vaccination. The patient reported she takes tacrolimus for the treatment of her eczema. Also she said that she had some joint pain for a couple of days. She said 2-1/2 days later (Friday, 12Feb2021), out of the blue, she had an eczema flare up. She said she was diagnosed with eczema at 67 years old.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

On 01Feb2021, she tested positive for COVID 19. On 28Jan2021 (also reported as on 28Jan20201 or 29Jan2021), she was feeling bad. Her little granddaughter had COVID virus (was infected at the school) and passed it on to her. Now she has been going to different places checking it out and she went to urgent care because her heart was beating fast on 02Feb2021. She had an electrocardiogram and her lungs were okay on an unspecified date. They told her was eligible to get an infusion but she doesn&#39;t know what it is. The urgent care clinic told her she could get the infusion but then she can&#39;t get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She wants to ask if this is true. She was being offered a monoclonal antibody infusion. When ask if this is the first time to call, she stated she called once before right after she found out that she had the COVID 19 infection to ask if she could still get the second shot. She did report at that time that she had gotten the first dose and then tested positive for COVID 19 and she previously provided product information including the lot number from her vaccine card. She added that her heart has been going very fast and has been having fever on 02Feb2021 for two or three days. It is not as high today as it was before. She does want to get the second dose. The first dose helped her so much. On 04Feb2021 (reported as yesterday), she was checked at urgent care because of heart concern and a bit of pressure in chest. Patient stated she only had a little cough, sore throat and runny nose, but she hasn&#39;t experienced any other symptoms on an unspecified date. The patient&#39;s weight was 54.43 kg on 01Feb2021.

A 69-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EN5318), via intramuscular on 12Feb2021 13:00 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation.  Patient had history of diabetes and had been well controlled for a long time. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Shortly after vaccination, patient began complaining of tiredness and told husband she wanted to take a nap. At 16:30 husband found patient minimally responsive and checked her BG (blood glucose) which was 25. Husband gave patient oral forms of sugar and transported to the ER (Emergency Room) where her BG slowly improved to normal range. Outcome of the events was resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient had history of diabetes. The reported blood glucose decrease and hyporesponsive to stimuli were more likely due to pre-existing diabetes, and less likely causally related to the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She said that her lymph node in her breast is killing her on the side that she had the vaccine. She clarified that it is very painful and her breast itself is very painful. She said that she did go to the doctor to be sure that is what it was. She further reported that by Thursday night (18Feb2021), it started bothering and her breast started bothering her. She thought she pulled a muscle at first. She said that it has progressed and got worse and that Sunday night she was in agony. She called the doctor Monday for her left breast that hurts.  She said that she is taking ibuprofen (ADVIL, Lot: DJ6716, Expiration: Dec2022), taking 3 of them at a time, but it is not really helping. She had no reaction at the injection site. It is not red and you cannot see anything there. She said that is why she is not even sure. She said that there was no pain at all there. She said that there is nothing wrong with her and she does not feel sick, she just hurts. She said that she was tired because she is not sleeping well due to the pain. Patient wants to know what pain medication she could use that will not counteract the vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

This 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: EL9267) at single dose on 09Feb2021 14:15 in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe respiratory infection from Nov2019. Patient thought she might have had COVID, but she was way early, before anyone knew it was in the country, back in Nov2019, she had a severe respiratory infection. Patient stated that her husband was a respiratory therapist, and he fortunately had enough albuterol to choke a horse with, and if it had not been for that and the nebulizer, the caller would have had to go to the hospital. Patient stated that she would wake up in the night and need three or four treatments. Patient stated that before being sick, she had horses and it would take 15-20 minutes to do her routine with the horses, but while she was sick, it took two hours. Patient stated that she would walk out and back, and it was an ordeal, she was tired and short of breath. Patient stated that the doctors called it severe respiratory inflammation, and that was in Nov and Dec2020. Patient stated that she was put on steroids at that time, and she really didn&#39;t want to go back to the doctor, so she took some of her husband&#39;s steroids, he had some dexamethasone, and she took that and started to feel better. There was no concomitant medication taken. Patient reported flu-like symptoms on 11Feb2021 after her first dose of Pfizer Covid19 vaccine. Symptoms included fever, chills, aches, pains, vomiting, abdominal pain -felt like severe case of the flu on 11Feb2021. Patient would like to know if these were normal adverse events and if they could be worse for her, because she may have had a Covid infection previously. Patient asked what was the efficacy after one dose of the Pfizer-Biontech Covid19 vaccine if she chose not to get the second dose. Patient took her first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 09Feb2021. Patient stated that two days later, she had side effects and had had them for the last 6 days. Patient stated that if someone picked it, she had it. Patient stated that she had a fever, chills and pain. Patient&#39;s fever was running at 102.5 in Feb2021, and she could get it down with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and alcohol. Patient stated that she heard somewhere that the first dose offers 85% protection against the virus, and she was wondering if that was accurate. Caller was scheduled for her next dose on 09Mar2021. Patient was still having aches and pains, and she had vomiting. Patient stated that she was still not over this part of it yet. Patient stated that her side effects started on 11Feb2021 between 4 and 5PM, so more than 48 hours later and they all of a sudden just hit her. Patient stated that the vomiting had stopped, but she did still get some abdominal pain once in a while, but the vomiting stopped about two days ago, but for a while she could not keep food down, and she was just trying to take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For events fever, chills, aches and pain, patient confirmed that these were all still ongoing, but they were getting better. Patient stated that these side effects were a little better yesterday, the caller got up and took a dexamethasone 5 mg and felt better. Patient stated that when she woke up this morning, she was feeling god awful, so she took another dexamethasone, and she was better this afternoon. Patient planned to go to an urgent care today, but she had not been to a doctor yet.

Patient stated they were serious, but nothing life threatening, caller confirmed all side effects were medically significant. Patient stated that she read that people who had COVID, would react with more severe side effects to the vaccine than people who did not have COVID, and she was wondering if that was correct. The outcome of event vomiting was resolved in Feb2021, outcome of event abdominal pain was unknown. The outcome of rest events was resolving.  The patient assessed drug result was related for all the events, Method of assessment: Global Introspection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;flu-like symptoms and associated fever, chills, aches, pains, vomiting, abdominal pain &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations. More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.

I have felt bouts of light-headedness, dizzyness, and tinges of nausea that are mild since I got the 1st shot, but not prior to that. Six hours after the first shot, i felt dizzy, nauseous =and it dissipated by an hour and disappeared entirely by late the next morning (1/22/2021). After the second shot, I had no side effects. However, as i described above, I have felt slight nausea and lightheadedness during the past month or so. But this is very serious. And I am scared to walk.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

Consumer said she received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last Sunday and has been experiencing some side effects. These side effects include Dizziness, Extreme fatigue and Pain on her arms. She wants to know if this was normal. She got her shot, later clarified as COVID shot, at hospital last Sunday, so about a week ago, and had no side effects up until yesterday, she was extremely tired, and last night about 6:30PM, she was very dizzy until 5 this morning. She works at a hospital; they gave the shot. Outcome of extremely tired: stated she was in bed, was just very lethargic, being very dizzy went away at 5 this morning, states she has recovered completely but she is just a little off. When asked for vaccination card, states she shouldn&#39;t have gotten up that fast, this was really weird that it would wait 5 days. This was her first shot, thinks the dose was on the paper, it was 0.3mg, she was not sure. The outcome of events for dizziness/ very dizzy was resolved on 15Jan2021, for fatigue/ extremely tired was resolving, for other events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL8982, unknown expiration), via injection in right arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 prevention.  Medical history included ongoing vertigo (in car accident a little over 5 years ago, that affected a big nerve in left temple, and so every once in a while she will get vertigo so bad that she falls over), ongoing GERD (from a hiatal hernia; diagnosed many years ago), ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 15 years ago, ongoing bad cholesterol diagnosed 10 to 15 years ago, ongoing heart burn, ongoing hiatus hernia, and car accident a little over 5 years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing omeprazole sodium (OMEPRAZOLE) for GERD, heart burn, and hiatal hernia (started this product at least 10 years ago; takes the product as needed if she is having heart burn or is going to eat spicy food); ongoing vitamin D3 for vitamin supplementation (started product about 8 months ago, because her doctor told her too, she guesses her vitamin was low); ongoing metoprolol for high blood pressure and to prevent stroke (started product at least 15 years ago; her BP could be regular but it could shoot up when she is upset, so she takes this to prevent stroke); ongoing hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure (started product at least 5 years ago); pravastatin for bad cholesterol  (started the product at least 4 or 5 or more years ago); and ongoing acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) to prevent stroke (has been taking this product forever, at least for 10 years).  The patient reported that she received the first COVID shot on 13Jan2021. She was okay on the 13th, 14th, and 15th. However, on the 16th (16Jan2021), she woke up and threw up once and was very dizzy for three days. She mentioned that she had like vertigo, she couldn&#39;t even walk, she had to crawl and her husband had to walk her around, she couldn&#39;t do anything. She had vertigo (16Jan2021). She was that way on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, the patient&#39;s son took her to acupuncturist for her dizziness and was able to get up fine and walked away. After the acupuncture, she felt fine, like she was all better. On 19Jan2021 (reported as yesterday), she was fine. She woke up at midnight and had terrible acid reflux for 3 hours even though she had hardly eaten. She does take omeprazole for heart burn, and she had taken omeprazole earlier in the day, but it was just coming up, that acid and burning. She drank milk to coat the stomach and it went away at 03:00 AM. She had very bad chills/terrible chills (20Jan2021) and her teeth were chattering, she couldn&#39;t even talk, and couldn&#39;t control the chills. She is fine now. She clarified that she got vertigo from a car crash years ago and haven&#39;t had it in almost a year. Chills are not ongoing at this time, she has not had any for about 4 hours now, and she is hoping she is recovered completely, but it may be too soon to tell. She did not receive other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient is wondering if all this could be from the vaccine. The patient wanted to know if it is safe to take the second shot. She was scheduled to receive the second dose on 03Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events threw up on 16Jan2021; unable to walk and vertigo on 18Jan2021; dizziness on 19Jan2021; and terrible acid reflux on 20Jan2021. While unknown outcome for chills.

                                                I was sneezing non stop; injection site was sore; can&#39;t taste; nose started running/ my nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear; asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID; asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID; I felt scratchy in my throat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

A 70-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot: EL3248, expiry 30Apr2021), intramuscular on 23Jan2021 08:15 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization (prevention because she has autoimmune). Medical history included Behcet&#39;s syndrome and Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, both are overactive immune system problem/autoimmune diseases, which were diagnosed 20 years ago; diagnosed allergies; compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity; and patient have had shingles before. Family history was reported as none. Concomitantly, she was just taking daily medications that were not relevant. There was no prescriber for the vaccine.  It was through a hospital. It was reported that vaccination was given at 08:15 to 08:30. Patient had no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). No additional vaccines administered the same date of the Pfizer suspect.  Patient had not had prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Patient received her first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday 23Jan2021. She stated, on Tuesday 26Jan2021, patient was hurting on the waist around the back. On Wednesday, 27Jan2021, that next morning, she went to see her internal doctor and they thought a kidney infection or not; he was not sure if she had a kidney infection or what was going on. Patient went home and it got worse and patient went to the ER (Jan2021), also reported as ended up going to the ER. They did a CT scan gave her medicine. They did a CT scan and said it was not her bladder or anything (Jan2021). They thought it was diverticulitis; nothing helped. They gave her medication and she kept getting sick (2021).  No further details provided on medication given. On Friday, 29Jan2021, early morning, patient went back to the ER, they did another CT with contrast it wasn&#39;t diverticulitis, but it was shingles, and patient have had shingles before, this was the 4th time. It was reported that when the doctor came in, he thought this was shingles and she has had shingles previously. She has had it about 3 other times and the pain was just off the scale (Jan2021).  Her blood pressure went up to 211/92 and they were giving her morphine for the pain (Jan2021).  She was questioning if she should get the second dose. She has two autoimmune diseases and it was an overactive immune disease.  She took the one vaccine and her doctor said to contact Pfizer being as it is kind of new and especially since she has the autoimmune issues.  She would like to know if it is safe for her to have the second vaccine.  She does not know if she will be over this.  She does not feel well (Jan2021).  She was afraid of taking it if it will be any worse (Jan2021). Patient felt all right until she had the vaccine, on Tuesday the problem started (26Jan2021). They were giving her medication for the shingles and for the pain. Patient stated that &#34;it set something off&#34;. Patient was still sick (2021), still taking pain pills. Patient didn&#39;t know how many days she has. Her second vaccine is on 13Feb2021. As sick as she has been, and her overactive immune system and if she still has the shingles those can last a long time, she doesn&#39;t want to go through what she went through. This was a lot of pain and with shingles they can last, 6 months or a year. The nurse called her back and told her to report to Pfizer. Patient was taking the medicine for the shingles right now. She doesn&#39;t know what will happen. She doesn&#39;t want to be sick. Patient asked for the efficacy after 1 dose and how much protection it has. She did fill out something because she talked with someone else.  She confirmed it was through VAERS and not with Pfizer. She said the pain around her waist was a little better because they gave her the medicine for shingles and she has pain pills. She said one was Valacyclovir and she could not remember the name of the other. Patient had required two trips to ER.  First one was on 27Jan2021 and went to internal medicine doctor and that night went to the ER.  They did CT scan and it was not bladder or anything. Second visit on 29Jan2021 and did CT with contrast and the doctor thought it was shingles since she had shingles three times before.  She has had them internally.  The doctor said it would not necessarily need to be externally break outs.  The next two times she did not break out.  She did not have anything around her waist. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events hurting on my waist around the back, kidney infection, diverticulitis, shingles, and sick.

Took acetaminophen  and some anti -nausea drugs I had on hand.  Fever left, but returned next night.  Weakness, no appetite stayed for two days.  Thought it was the flu, but no upper respiratory symptoms.  Thought it might be Covid-19 but tested negative.  Finally decided it was a reaction to the vaccine.

By the following afternoon I was exhausted and no longer feeling that effect.  Nothing was done since it did not last.  It was suggested that I report it since it is not mentioned as a side effect in the list of information.

There was a sense of nausea initially but it went away. There was pronounced feeling of heat located subcutaneously on my right outer thigh. It came and went about every minute or so. (I counted the seconds in between each incident). I am still experiencing flu like symptoms (bodily aches, slight headache, mild chest pain, and general ill-feeling.) I will contact my primary care physician today about my concerns but felt it necessary to document these mild but disturbing side effects.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily. She does not have her COVID CDC Card at the moment, her husband has that information but he is on a conference call with a client and she cant disturb him. The patient was scheduled for a second dose on 06Mar2021. That&#39;s where she has a question, the doctor is saying that he is not sure about getting second shot. They took lab work at the hospital and said everything was fine except for white blood cell count, it was on the lower side in Feb2021. She has had no vaccines on the same day or in the 4 weeks prior. She hasn&#39;t had any vaccines. She did have to visit the emergency room. She only called the doctors office, the doctor said not to come in and go tot he ER. She has No relevant family medical history that she would like to share. The severe allergic reaction, &#34;skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen&#34;, injection site pain, redness of the skin, itchiness, joint muscle pain and whole body was in pain was recovering. The event tiredness recovered with sequelae on 15Feb2021 and the event joint and muscle pain was recovered on 16Feb2021. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL8982, expiration date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included anaphylaxis with insect bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took codeine and diazepam (VALIUM) and experienced hyperkinetic reaction. The patient stated that she received the vaccine on 14Jan2021, and that day 6 hours later, she had headache, fever, chills and body ache; and the next day on 15Jan2021, when she woke up, she had rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, and she still had the rash. On an unspecified date, the patient had 3 days with out sleeping. The patient assessed the events as non-serious. The patient further reported that she was hyperkinetic and she has had that reaction many years prior reporting, before when taking codeine or VALIUM, one of the ingredients in VALIUM. She went to the doctor the first day, who saw her rash and told her to report that. It was not itching. The patient had the appointment for the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, this coming Thursday and wanted to know if there would be a problem to get the second dose. She was afraid to get the vaccine the first time, because she had a history of anaphylaxis with insect bites. She carried an epi pen, and the vaccine provider had one too and the paramedics was there, and everything was okay; they were nice with her. The patient didn&#39;t have any problem until later. The patient spoke to her health care professional and he thought it was okay for her to get the second dose and the health care professional just told her to put a cream on her rash. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, which included putting a cream on her rash. The patient was not recovered from the rash on legs, arms, chest and stomach, while the outcome of the events &#34;headache, fever, chills, body ache, and 3 days with out sleeping&#34; was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number EN6205) via unspecified route of administration on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was not provided. Upon 15 minutes after injection, she noted nausea with belching and had some SOB. Symptoms worsened as she ambulated over to the medical bay along with her chest pressure. She denied rash, hives, welts, hoarseness, stridor, itching, lightheadedness, dizziness, facial swelling, lip swelling and tongue swelling. Patient reported recently admitted for unstable angina and CAD with tachycardia. Patient had elevated d-dimer and blood clot was ruled out. Patient discontinued on new medication, beta blocker. Since discharge this Sunday 21Feb2021, she reported chest heaviness as if she has &#34;cardboard on chest.&#34; Can slightly increase with going up and down stairs or increased activity. She states she had reached out to her cardiologist via an online site but has not heard back. Patient stated her pain is about the same today. Patient complains of chest tightness and shortness of breath. The outcome of events was unknown.   No Follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of events unstable angina and tachycardia cannot be excluded. The patient&#39;s age and suspected cardiac condition are risk factors. The event CAD, given its progressive nature, is most likely an underlying condition, thus unrelated to the suspect drug.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The possibility that suspect drug may have contributed to the reported event cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 70-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 70-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included viruses, flus (I have had viruses, flus my whole life), five surgeries, gallbladder removed, and asthma, all from unspecified dates and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) on an unspecified date, at the age of 70-years-old and experienced a very sore arm. On an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient experienced, &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34;. The clinical course was reported as follows: &#34;I wanted to call today because I got the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 3 weeks ago, 03Feb2021 it was. After the first dose I had a very sore arm and that was it. It was more sore than normal vaccine, but it was that was all I had. After the second dose I was not aware that I would get sick to the extreme that I did. I found out afterwards that other people have said this, I did not know at the time. I thought I was going to die. I am a 70-year-old woman, I am not young, and I have had viruses, flus my whole life and I got so sick. First, I had over a 103 temperature, it came on suddenly, 12 hours to the minute after I got the vaccine. On top of that I had such bad chills I never saw anything like that in my life, 5 blankets on top of me, sweaters, sweatshirts and the fever was so high. I could not keep the Tylenol down because I had nausea and I would throw it up. So, I could not even get rid of it. Then on top of that my arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all, plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain, it was excruciating. I have had 5 surgeries, my arm hurt worse than all 5 surgeries put together. And I had my gall bladder removed and everything, nothing hurt to this extent. Now also I have asthma, nothing severe but I do have asthma, so I have one of those little oximeters and you put it on your finger and it checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91, all night it was 91, my chest was shortness of breath. I was ready to go to the hospital. And I did not know it was going to be that bad.&#34; When clarified about the treatment the patient stated that &#34;yes, the Tylenol helped once I could hold it down. The doctor gave me something to stop the vomiting and the nausea. And then I could take the Tylenol and then the Tylenol worked great. But at first, I was so sick I could not hold the Tylenol down in my stomach I would throw it up, that was the problem.&#34; When asked about lab work the patient stated that she had not had lab work done since the first vaccine. She stated that she had stayed in the house because she had other health issues and was afraid to come out for 11 months. So she had not gone out to get anything done. The patient stated that she called because if a third dose was needed, she suggested that a smaller dose be given to small people. She stated that she took childrens medicine most of the time because she was tiny. She wanted to know if Pfizer in the future would be making doses for small people and doses for bigger people. Her suggestion was to have a separate booster to go by weight or by gender, men usually did not experience the same. The clinical outcomes of the events &#34;I thought I was going to die&#34;, &#34;sick&#34;, &#34;over a 103 temperature/the fever was so high&#34;, &#34;I had such bad chills&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34;, &#34;I would throw it up&#34;, &#34;arm was so bad, it had its own pulse, a pulse of its own, I could not lift it at all plus the pain was like a tooth ache pain&#34;, &#34;checks your oxygen level and normally its 98-99, it went down to 91/her oxygen level was down to 90&#34; and &#34;my chest was shortness of breath&#34; were all recovered/resolved on unspecified dates.

                                                Immediately upon injection I felt totally dizzy as though I was drunk, slight pain at base of tongue left side. The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

                                                After receiving the first shot on Monday,  I developed a headache and double vision on Tuesday night. I consulted an ophthalmologist and I am awaiting the scheduling of an MRI. He could find no physical problem with either eye. The double vision persists. I realize this may be purely coincidental and unrelated to the vaccine, but I felt I should report it.

                                                Muscle in lower area of throat started to feel slightly tight. Could still breath and swallow. Several staff members checked on me. Blood pressure top number was 175, ten minutes later it dropped to 155. Staff member stated my pulse was elevated. Although, I only felt the slight tightness in my throat. My oxygen level stayed at 98. They had me stay for an hour and then I went home. By then the tightness started to lessen. After an hour or two the feeling was total gone. My blood pressure had gone back to normal when I checked it at home. The next day at 2 pm [13 hours later] I had a temperature of 99.1, had the chills yet felt warm, started a slight headache and became very tired. At 2 am in the morning everything was over. I woke at my normal time and felt great. Have been doing well ever since.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 06Jan2021 09:40 at a single dose as COVID vaccine. The patient had no medical history. Concomitant medications noted as on other medications but nothing new. She previously got the shingle shot for immunization then her arm hurt a few days. She had no other reaction to vaccines in the past. She received no vaccine on the day of or in the prior 4 weeks. Last Wednesday on 06Jan2021, the patient took the vaccine and has had a headache since; even touching her head hurts. She had a persistent headache that started the day after the vaccine and has continued since. The next day on 07Jan2021 was when the headache started. She took regular Motrin (lot OFE3249A, expiry: May2022) and Tylenol extra strength (lot: LMA051, expiry: Jul2019, perhaps not working anymore) sometimes but they didn&#39;t really seem to help. She felt the best when she was standing up or laying down, and she would rather be laying down. She asked &#34;Is this a normal side effect, am I dying? I am not a headache kind of person, I take a Motrin, it goes away and I do not have one for months. It actually hurts to the touch.&#34; Should she be worried? She did call the clinic about the headache and was told if it got serious to go to the emergency room, she didn&#39;t think it was that serious. It was just persistent. She could leave with the pain if it kept her from getting COVID but the fact it was persistent worried her. It was also reported that on 06Jan2021 with this shot her arm really hurt when getting it and that day but that was all (pain in the arm the shot was given), the next night there was no pain. Her and her husband both oooo&#39;d and ahhhh&#39;d with the pain in the arm but that was it (a very uncomfortable pain they experienced in their arm after receiving the injection). She asked how long a side effect lasts after the vaccine? She also stated that on Jan2021, they insist on giving the next dose in 4 weeks. Asked if the vaccine was given a week later would the efficacy be lower? The outcome of persistent headache was not recovered; of vaccination site pain was recovered on 07Jan2021; and of the other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021036651 same reporter and drug, different patient and AE

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EJ1686, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 11:00 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included arm soreness from flu shot 2-3 months ago. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that she received her 1st dose of the vaccine on her left arm on 31Dec2020 as she works with elderly at nursing home and she was of age. Two days after her shot, on 02Jan2021, she experienced little headache which lasted all day but was gone by the following day. On 12Jan2021, 2 days ago, when she woke up and got of bed with severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint which lasted for maybe 10 minutes. It was so severe she could hardly get out of bed. Currently, she had no joint pain. The right shoulder and right hip pain were so odd she thought, but it has also improved since. It&#39;s been 2 weeks and she never had this happen before. This lasted a little while, but thought it was from the cold weather since it&#39;s been 2 weeks since having the vaccine. She still has a bit of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose on an unspecified date. She mentioned this to her supervisor and was encouraged to call and she wants to know if this could be a side effect. The patient had no vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. She had the flu shot before in past and the area would be sore for a few days, but now with this Covid vaccine this arm was still tender. Also, she had gotten the shingles shot the same day as the flu shot but that was about 2-3 months ago, at least 2 months ago. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Covid vaccine. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the first administration. Outcome of event headache was recovered on 03Jan2021; severe pain in right shoulder joint and right hip joint/it was so severe she could hardly get out of bed was recovered in Jan2021; and outcome of tenderness on the left arm where she received the vaccine dose was not recovered.

A 71-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EI9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Jan2021 at 14:00 on the left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and had no known allergies. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EH9899) on 03Jan2021 on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. It was reported that on 25Jan2021, the next day after the vaccination, the patient woke up with severe muscle and joint pain, fever 100°F, dizziness, severe headache and no appetite. The patient took 2 Tylenol and it got better. Six hours later she took another 2 Tylenol because the headache came back; slept a couple of times a day and had a good night&#39;s sleep. Next day, she was a little better but still in bed, she fed myself better. The next day she went to the doctor (prior appointment) and was prescribed Meloxicam and Tylenol 6 hours after and was getting better. The outcome of the events was recovered. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID.

After receiving the second vaccine, I sneezed and had a constantly runny/blocked nasal passages for almost 24 hours.  It was a long night.  I must have sneezed more than 100 times.  Never had anything like this before in my life. about 10 AM the following day it simply stopped as fast as it started and has not reoccurred.  I received the Pfizer vaccine. Had muscle/joint aches but nothing that happened was a big deal

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

Was told it was basically shingles. Her internist was on the fence because she just had the COVID-19 Vaccine and wasn&#39;t certain. Caller stated it was ironic that she broke out after the vaccine. Caller&#39;s internist stated for any rash it would be treated the same with Valtrex. Internist stated chances were the rash was viral so if it&#39;s not shingles, would be treated with Valtrex. Rash and Itching: Wasn&#39;t very bad on Saturday, 23Jan2021, which was the first time she had someone look at it. On Sunday, 24Jan2021 it was full blown and really blossomed.

Outcome of the events headache, malaise, fatigue was recovered on n unspecified date, while unknown for the other events.

Medical history included low sodium, Covid-19 in Nov2020 (She had felt sick for a week and on 13Nov2020 she went to the ER and they did blood tests and she could not eat or drink for 3 days. She stated that she had 4 different IV fluids going and one of them was sodium and the other was for nausea), blood did not clot properly, broke her back. There were no concomitant medications.The patient had a unique reaction after receiving the Covid-19mRNA Vaccine. She clarified that she never had a reaction to a shot before. She received the vaccine on 31Dec2020 and was fine for the first 20 hours. She said that the next morning on 01Jan2021 at 0600 she woke up cold  and could not get warm. She said that she spent the next 24 hours to where she kept adding clothes and blankets to keep warm. She stated that she was freezing and the she felt like the interior of her body was freezing even down to her toes felt cold. She also had injection site pain and the arm felt heavy and stated that the pain extended from her shoulder down to her elbow. She stated that the injection site pain was kind of delayed. She had aches and pains. She said that some of the pain went from the injection shoulder and spread to the middle of her spine. She had nausea and total loss of appetite and could not even eat. Her aches and pains after the vaccine were similar aches like she had with the Covid. She said that she had a terrible headache when she had Covid though. She stated that after the 24 hours of receiving the vaccine she had a little headache, but she took a migraine pill for it. She said that she was able to shed clothes, but she could not take a shower, but within 24-36 hours she was back to normal like it all never happened. She said that was when she figured out it was like her hemorrhaging with one of her childbirths. She explained that she had 3 children and hemorrhaged with each of her child births and was going into shock with one of them and felt this freezing sensation due to blood loss. She thought that her reaction to the vaccine was so bad that she was either not making blood or there was an interference. There was some kind of weird interruption. She said that her blood clots break down from minutes to hours after her child birth or with dental procedures. She had a PAI-1 deficiency or Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 deficiency. She said that there was also something deeper that her doctors had not figured out yet too. She said that her blood did not clot properly. She said that she did not bruise or anything, but she was not allowed to have internal surgery without a transfusion. She said that her doctor&#39;s started to figure this all out after she broke her back before. She went to a hematologist and had her counts checked regularly. She said that she was being studied by 127 different clinics. She gained 10lbs, but she was very physically active. This was her first dose of teh vaccine. She said that her doctors told her that she needs to be under 48 hours of observation if she gets the second vaccine. Her primary care physician recommended that she did not take another mRNA vaccine. She said that she was taking their advice and canceled her second dose appointment. She said that when she had Covid-19 they did a Chest x-ray on 13Nov2020 and she had low sodium. She said that they gave her tramadol at the hospital for her headache, but she had already taken 3 migraine pills that day. She had already had her flu shot and read somewhere on a website, that mRNA vaccines might cause unstable anticoagulation. She wondered if it could be possible that Covid-19 antibodies interfered with her injection? The outcome of events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 at a single dose in the hospital for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety, seizures, and high cholesterol. She passed out last summer and they put her in the hospital from 31Aug2020 and ran all kinds of tests. In the end, they said she only had a few PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) and she doesn&#39;t need to see the doctor for a year. Mentioned she also has chronic bronchitis and this is related to having low platelet count and low immunity. All of these events predate treatment with Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Concomitant medication included amlodipine, atorvastatin for high cholesterol, clonazepam for seizures, escitalopram for anxiety, levothyroxine sodium for thyroid, and mirtazapine for sleep; all were ongoing. Stated that she had something weird happen after her injection about four hours after the shot. She received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 13Jan2021 at 17:39 in the right arm. About three or four hours later on 13Jan2021, she was getting ready for bed and when she sat down and leaned over she had a god awful burning in her chest and nausea. She was going to take baking soda but when she sat up she had horrible pressure and pain in her chest and felt woozy so she sat on the floor and then the pain started to radiate through her arm and into her neck. The horrible pain and pressure in her chest felt like something was sitting on her chest and the bad pain in her chest was going into her arm and a little into her neck. She laid real still on the floor, and did a lot of praying, and then 20 minutes later it totally stopped. She got up slowly and finished getting ready for bed and was fine. She was just hoping they will still let her get the second shot. The whole event only lasted 20 minutes and when it was over it was completely gone. She did tell her husband when he came home. She was alone when this happened. The patient wanted to know if she can receive second dose of vaccine. She stated it almost felt like a heart attack. She was planning to get the second dose on 03Feb2021. Wanted to know if her effect will preclude her from getting the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on 13Jan2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 14Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization.

She was able to sleep, however, the pain in her head is still there. She took aspirin along with her regular medication. When providing details, the patient made the comment that she can&#39;t think straight. She also has sinus problems, so she doesn&#39;t know if she has a headache from the sinus problems or because of the shot. She doesn&#39;t have a fever. She just feels like her head is big. She sees the date of when she is supposed to return for her second vaccine, 04Feb2021. She sees the lot number and then it has (name of center). The actual dose is unknown, she knows this is her first dose. She also receives infusions for her arthritis. She receives an infusion at a facility once a month, she used to receive it less than that, but her arthritis has been really bad, so she now does it once a month. She was supposed to go today but she didn&#39;t go because she didn&#39;t feel good. She had three COVID tests done because she had the sinus situation going on. A COVID test was done yesterday (14Jan2021) and it was negative. Another one was done when she had a gastric endoscopy on 09Dec2020. This test was also negative. She doesn&#39;t remember if she had another one in Dec2020 when she was at the emergency center, but all of her COVID tests have been negative. The patient has not recovered from headache. Outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 28Jan2021, 11:00 AM (lot number:EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient medical condition included right Bundle Branch Block, cardiac from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and Upgraid. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 06Jan2021, 02:00PM (lot number: EL3249) at the age of 72 years for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for covid-19. Twenty-four hours after vaccine received, on 29Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, the patient suddenly lost ability to speak intelligibly. The patient stated &#34;I was completely aware though a little &#34;foggy&#34;. Blood pressure 170/84. Friend present thought I was having a TIA and called 911. Ambulance came.  Within 25 minutes, my ability to speak returned slowly. By the time I got to the ER, (45 minutes after onset), my ability to speak had mostly returned.&#34; Many blood labs were drawn, CT of head done, MRI of head done. EKG done. No cause of incident or evidence of TIA seen. After 5 hours, the patient was discharged with orders to come back if symptoms reoccurred. The patient had a headache, scratchy throat, fatigue and body aches in 2021. Since then the patient had a variety of tests, labs and Dr. visits. Blood pressure has been higher than her normal of 120/80, at intervals during the day in 2021. Since no evidence of TIA has been found, the patient was wondering if there have been any other reports of this loss of speaking ability (aphasia) occurring with any other vaccine recipients. The patient received treatment for the events. The consumer considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Medical history included her left eye had a virus that was finally taken care of back in Mar2020 but took a year and a half to heal. She had 5 surgery on that eye from an unspecified date. Also, her left lymph node got filled with fluid and was swollen but the doctors were not concerned about it. She would see an ENT for this. The patient has been seeing a neurologist who has done brain scans and MRI&#39;s due to the loss of peripheral vision do to eye problems. The patient has no allergies and is basically healthy. Concomitant medications include unspecified &#34;natural stuff&#34;. The reporter stated she had a pretty bad reaction with the vaccine and it took 3 days to get over, her neck froze up. She woke on 22Jan2021 with the frozen neck. She got the first shot on Thursday, 21Jan2021, and on Friday morning, 22Jan2021, when she woke up she could not look up, down, left or right. It was like her neck was frozen or paralyzed, the muscles would not move. Any effort to move her neck would send shooting pain in her head. She applied a heating pad, took Aleve, she took a couple of them, a massager, biofreeze, and stayed in bed. She was doing anything to loosen the muscles. The next morning she was able to look up and down but still not left or right. She did the same thing for treatment that day. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, she was better, was able to move her head 3 of 4 directions. She continued with the treatment she had been using and by Monday, 25Jan2021, her muscles loosed up and her neck worked again. She was sure it is muscles and when she called her neurologist confirmed it was a muscle issue. She was in a lot of pain in her head and neck. The patient was under care for her neck and head and wondered if this happened because this was a weak area, she did not know if related. The patient remarked she was scared to get the second dose due to the problems she had with the first. She heard that the second dose was the one with worse side effects. She was in bed 3 days with this first one. It was reported that the events did not require a visit to Emergency Room, and required visit to physician office. Patient called the neurologist due to the pain and was told to go to acute care to evaluate but she didn&#39;t go. The patient stated that this was scary like waking up with Bells palsy and was wondering if she would ever get better. She has never had anything like this happen to her before. She has to be attributed it to the shot. The patient needed guidance on getting the second dose, and had questions about side effects. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                On 2/2/21 I developed chest pressure and irregular heart beat at 4:00 pm.  Went to ER and it spontaneously resolved while staff was telling me how they would treat it.  Gave me Metoprolol 5 mg IV with 500 IV fluids and discharged.  Then on 2/6/21 I slept poorly and felt very jittery and had more chest pressure but pulse was regular.  then on 2/8/21 at 6:00 am I awoke and felt terrible with chest pressure.  Took my blood pressure at home and it was  193/103, and I was very shaky.  Went to  ER where they did blood work, X-ray, and monitored my heart and blood pressure for 4 hrs.  Gradually my blood pressure came down, and my blood work and X-ray probed to be WNL.  I was discharged without medication change but had echocardiogram scheduled and follow-up  appt. with Cardiologist, on  zoom.  He started me on Flecainide 100 mg bid, and stress test on  2/24/21 and follow-up appt. with him on 3/3/21.  I also had a follow-up appt. with my GP the day after the first ER visit and she ordered more labs, and the echocardiogram.  I have continued to have feelings of fluttering and pressure in my chest off and on and they continued after my second vaccine.  But my heart has remained regular since starting the Flecainide.  But my blood pressure went up to 150/85 on 2/9/21 and again to 142/81 on 2/10/21 both times with feelings of jitteriness and pressure in my chest.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom&#39;s did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn&#39;t put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can&#39;t get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn&#39;t want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported angina and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. Note however, that the patient has underlying angina with some stents that may also have contributed to the event. Case will be re-assess once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon my evaluation she is stable but begins to cough.  She has moderate posterior pharyngeal irritation as well.  She has been monitored.  Chest x-ray is reassuring.  The present do not think labs are necessary.  She is been advised to monitor her symptoms at home and return for any concerns.  I recommended Benadryl as well as short course of prednisone.  She has received prednisone here and advised her to take prednisone tomorrow and then discuss additional doses with her primary doctor control

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9261; expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration from 21Jan2021 to 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for an unspecified indication. Medical history included &#39;thyroid&#39; from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing at 100 ug, 1x/day for &#39;thyroid&#39;. Patient stated that she spoke with her physician&#39;s assistant. Patient received vaccine on the 21st of January, the first shot at her local place. The following morning at 4 in the morning, patient had severe arm pain where the shot was injected. So patient put a hot compress on it and took some paracetamol (TYLENOL). Patient mentioned that it didn&#39;t relieve for about an hour and a half. Patient meant the pain was really severe but finally it went away. The next day, it came back again and then the patient did it again and the pain keep coming back. Patient stated &#34;And now it&#39;s been tomorrow will be a week. And that&#39;s too long to have muscle pain from my shot&#34;. Patient also mentioned that second day after the shot, migraine headache started. Patient stated, &#34;Now I get them, but I only get them in the spring and I get them in the Fall. I don&#39;t get the migraine headaches in the winter time. I could only take Excedrin Migraine for the migraine, it&#39;s just over the counter medicine. And so I took that for the headache but those have not gone away either. When patient contacted her physician&#39;s assistant just now, it was reported that patient the physician&#39;s assistant is going to write a prescription for a muscle relaxer. Patient also reported that she is not going to take that second shot as she didn&#39;t know where to go to cancel it but she is not taking it. Patient mentioned she can&#39;t have pains like this. Patient stated that she can&#39;t tolerate pain to begin with, let alone have excess pain in her system. Patient added that she doesn&#39;t take medications. She is only on a thyroid medication (later confirmed the name as levothyroxine). Patient confirmed that the vaccine was Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. When probed for the due date of the next shot, patient stated &#39;February 11th at 12 o&#39; clock&#39;. Patient also stated &#39;I am not getting it, I am not taking the second shot. I didn&#39;t get you, I don&#39;t know what you said. I am not understanding you. I am not getting what you are saying. I am not taking the second shot, it is scheduled for February 11th of 2021, I am not taking it. Because they called and asked if I wanted to receive it and my age is almost 73. So, I thought I probably should give it a chance. But now with the reaction I don&#39;t want the second one&#39; and &#39;I don&#39;t know if there is something wrong with this phone or something wrong with the connection, I don&#39;t understand, I get part of it but I don&#39;t understand the other part. It blanks out, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, you are asking me something, but I don&#39;t know what it is&#39;. Patient also reported that the pain started the day after she got the shot, 22Jan2021. Patient is still having pain. Patient also confirmed that TYLENOL was the treatment for pain but it was not working. Medication for migraine was reported as EXCEDRIN migraine. Patient further confirmed EXCEDRIN Migraine did not help with the migraine and stated &#39;No, I still have it, it gives me some relief but then after wears off it comes back, the migraine comes back&#39;. Patient further added &#34;Okay, I am just going to rely on my physician assistant, she has got some medication ordered for me, a muscle relaxer. And I am going to try that and see if that will make everything go away&#34;.  Outcome of the events &#39;severe arm pain where the shot was injected&#39; and &#39;migraine headache&#39; was not recovered; outcome of the remaining event was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL9262, expiry date unknown) in the doctor&#39;s office, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Jan2021 at a single dose on the right arm as she was over 65, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus a long time ago since she was in her 60&#39;s, ongoing blood pressure, ongoing high cholesterol and cyst. Concomitant medication included ongoing losartan (manufacturer unknown) for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin (manufacturer unknown) for high cholesterol, metformin (manufacturer unknown) for diabetes mellitus from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and ongoing sitagliptin (JANUVIA) for diabetes mellitus. The patient was also prescribed an unspecified antibiotic for a cyst which was taken 2 weeks before the vaccination. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced itching on 27Jan2021, the same day as the Covid 19 shot later in the day, after she got home. She didn&#39;t pay attention to it. The next evening she called her doctor and told him about it and he said it was one of the side effects of the Covid 19 shot and prescribed Benadryl. She started the Benadryl that same night, 28Jan2021. She should not have waited, she should have called the doctor the same day. She called the pharmacy and got the prescription, it&#39;s not that far for her. The patient stated that the the itching lasted a couple of days, it is gone, as of an unspecified date. She took Benadryl for the itching, it is the best thing for her. In all, she thinks she went through 2 to 3 days of the whole situation. The patient also stated that she took Tylenol for the aches and that got better. She had aches but the aches from the Covid 19 shot started on 28Jan2021. On the day of the report, she was a lot better. The aches went away but does not recall what day they went away. She feels much better that day. The aches were not severe. She added that the aches and itching lasted for 2-3 days and are totally improved, that they stopped on an unspecified date. State she was able to go outside that day. She added that she was kind of tired. She had to lay down one day because the itching and aches were bad. The outcome of the event kind of tired was recovering while the outcome of the other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL3249), intramuscular on the right arm, at the age of 72 years, on 13Jan2021 09:45 at a SINGLE  DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason&#39;s she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn&#39;t feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria). The outcome of the event onset of burning and itching and skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over was recovered on an unspecified date while other events were unknown.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 73-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 around 13:00-14:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient got the vaccine this week on 06Jan2021 right after lunch/early afternoon. She had no issues. In the afternoon of 07Jan2021, she started getting a little dizzy and had a hard time focusing her sight. The patient also had neck and toe stiffness on 07Jan2021. She did not think about the vaccine until last evening of 07Jan2021. The hospital called to see how she was doing, and then it dawned on her. After, she took her blood pressure which was 126/68 with 81 pulse. She slept well last night of 07Jan2021. This morning on 08Jan2021 she had breakfast but still felt a little off kilter. It is like dizziness, not really dizzy, but more like her balance does not feel right. She was focusing better on 08Jan2021, but not like normal. The dizziness hit her on 07Jan2021 about 15:00. It had improved. She felt more at the time of the report, not really dizzy, but more like her balance did not feel right. It was earlier on 07Jan2021 around 14:00 she was on the ladder taking down her Christmas bows. She had no dizziness whatsoever. For neck and toes stiffness, she had one big toe that was arthritic and it did not seem to want to bend. She had been doing neck exercises which had helped. The outcome of dizziness, hard time focusing her sight, neck and toe stiffness were resolving, outcome of rest events were unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: SL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 12Jan2021 at 10:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took varicella zoster vaccine (SHINGLES VACCINE) for immunization and had a little reaction but just the normal things. On Tuesday morning, the patient got the COVID-19 shot and was fine. This morning (15Jan2021), the patient was not feeling great, has a slight headache, her breathing is heavier, and below her breast line is a tightness she can&#39;t really describe. The patient asked if these were a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and wondering if this is normal. As a treatment for the events, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient asked if she can or should get a test, a COVID-19 test. It has been so many days since having the vaccine, 4 days later, she is wondering if she might have COVID-19. The patient isn&#39;t sure and is just asking a question. It is confirmed that she has not had a test or tested positive for COVID-19. The outcome of &#34;Not feeling great&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL1284, expiration date unspecified), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed 15 years ago, maybe; High cholesterol diagnosed 20 years ago, she doesn&#39;t know, reflux diagnosed 20 years ago, maybe more, prediabetes and allergy induced asthma which she carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year. Patient reported that she was tested and they don&#39;t know for sure, but she reported that she may have allergy induced asthma as she has to take, carries an inhaler, and she has used it maybe three times a year, in the fall when leaves are falling down, the leaves get moldy, and she was driving in her car, or walking in a wooded area, she gets tightness, takes her inhaler and was fine, that&#39;s the extent, no other circumstances; fall or she had where a plant was blooming outdoors, she gets tightness, and she took her inhaler, and was good for the next year, so sitting in the environment and nothing further materializes, if she takes the inhaler three or two times a year, considering what other people have, she thought this was insignificant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that she got vaccinated this Friday and had nothing but a sore arm afterwards, on 16Jan2021 and was fine all day, evening, all day Saturday. She just had soreness at the site, she had no redness at the site of injection, but the weird part: she doesn&#39;t think anyone would believe, 33 hours later, at midnight, she was still up, on her way to bed, and all of a sudden she experienced extremely excruciating stabbing pains in her arm with the shot, it was stabbing, excruciating, and immediately at the same time, she had shivers/shivered and had a splitting headache, was freezing and had to put socks on, and had noticed very slight difficulty breathing, and since it was midnight, she didn&#39;t want to wake up her husband, she dozed off, and was up at 0530. She had body aches, slight, it was the least, but the stabbing stopped in her arm. She slept from 12:30 to 05:30, and the shivering and aches stopped, but the headache was still on, so she took a pill for the headache. She took the thermometer that marked 100F orally; she stated that the fever was higher in the night and she assumed with the shivering, she had a greater fever than 100. Also, the oximeter indicated 133 pulse and 86 of oxygen saturation. By 10:00, it all had resolved. She has an oximeter, and since she still had the feeling of difficulty breathing, she put it on, but her pulse was 133, that was when she was feeling better. It was reported that all symptoms were gone except for rapid pulse, it was 133 and the slight breathing, and her 02 saturation was anywhere between 86-88, it varied, and by 10:00, all issues resolved, her heartbeat was down to normal, her breathing was above 94, or whatever, everything was fine, and has been fine since then. Maybe she had fatigue on Saturday and Sunday, on Sunday was like after the flu, after you finish, you have fatigue and was a little out of it, this was on Sunday. On an unspecified date, the patient stated that she was shrinking and weight varies. Patient stated that the only thing she does have, says she has a cough, but because she needs a drink, she was not sick and she gets to drink water. She felt like the reaction she had was in the limit of a severe allergic reaction due to the rapid heartbeat and her difficulty breathing. She would like to know if there was information about these side effects reported so she can determine if she was going to have the second dose of the vaccine. Outcome of events states she was shrinking, weight varies and cough was unknown; and outcome of the rest of events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                Two days after receiving the vaccine,  on Jan 28th, I noticed pain in my right lower back area.  It went away so I didn?t pay much attention to it.  On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular on 30Jan2021 at 10:00 at a single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fever, being ill (deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks) and bug bites from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient is the type of person that takes a lot for her to take medications. She is allergic to a lot of things; she always has crazy reactions. She can&#39;t take morphine. It took her 7 pills to get the right one for high blood pressure. She has the craziest one-day reactions.  She received the COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday much against her will, knowing she had COVID but not diagnosed in March. She had a fever, she was deathly ill and it lasted for three weeks. She had a nasal swab done and it came back negative. She doesn&#39;t think that was right, she believes she had COVID-19 in Mar2020. Her daughter is younger, and she had the same thing, she couldn&#39;t breathe good for 3 weeks. She had pneumonia. She knows she had COVID-19. She was trying to lose weight. She was given her first COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor. Everything was going okay at first. About an hour and a half later, she became weird in her head, almost like a lightheadedness. She can&#39;t describe it. She has never taken drugs. She doesn&#39;t drink alcohol at all. She has like a virgin body. She states plus she is red headed, which it is known red heads have a harder time with medication. As the day goes on, she just felt lightheaded all the rest of the day. The next day (Sunday, 31Jan2021), she wakes up and it hits her like a ton of bricks. She woke in the morning and seemed to be okay and then it was like she was pregnant and blew up. She started cramping really bad and had gas. Everybody has gas. She was a little nauseated as well. She experienced lots of indigestion, cramping in her stomach like she was going to have a baby or the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot. She had a little bit of nausea. She had nausea pills because she had a gallbladder taken out and she took nausea pills for 2-3 days. She didn&#39;t take any medication for any of these symptoms she started to experience on Sunday. However, she did start popping Gas-X. She was taking two Gas-X every 3 or 4 hours. The caller states it helped. She had lots of gas; gas was just coming out of her bottom. She had the gas, cramps, her stomach hurt. She was able to get through it, which that is good. Then Monday, 01Feb2021 was the day she had weird things happen to her that she was kind of concerned about. Her muscles started to draw, that is the best way she can describe it. Her feet would just draw up weird. Her arms and hands would do crazy things and contort or draw up. This hurts because the muscles are like a rubber band pulling. It was weird, and she didn&#39;t like it. It wasn&#39;t like when she has a horse and has to get up and stand, it wasn&#39;t like that at all. Her muscles were tightening up like a rubber band. Her right arm was the worse with the pain and then her hands would kind of move in a kind of crazy way where it was tightening. She thought to herself, &#34;what is this Parkinson&#39;s?&#34;. She doesn&#39;t even know. She still has some stomach issues, but it is easing up. The gas is still coming out. It wasn&#39;t debilitating or anything. She has some minor nausea. What scared her more was the muscle cramping and pulling. Her toes would contort and go backwards. The muscle tightness occurred yesterday, 01Feb2021. It happened all day and was sporadic. Her toes moved in a different way like a rubber band pulling on muscle. Nothing has happened today. Everything was yesterday. Her whole body basically was affected, just different sections at different times. Today, she feels like the left arm is going to do something, it&#39;s like the last to be pulled. Her hands and fingers stayed the same. She explains like the upper arm area from her elbow to her shoulder part. She can&#39;t even think of what that area is, but it&#39;s the part between her elbow and shoulder. She has been doing lots of exercises and moving, hoping the part of her elbow to her should don&#39;t atrophy or won&#39;t pull. She hasn&#39;t told anybody about it. She doesn&#39;t like it. It was very frightening. She is scheduled for her second shot and she is scared to death to go back. She mentions her nerves are shot. From stress, she had previously broken out instantly. She thought it was a bug biting her. She never had gone to the doctor but after about 4 weeks, she thought she had these horrible bug bites. She was shaking her clothes and she almost wanted to strip it was so bad. She thought it was severe bug bites. She couldn&#39;t figure it out. She finally went to the doctor after a week. It was a Saturday. The doctor told her it was shingles. Explained that it itches a lot. She went on medication. She clarifies she went on acyclovir 800mg, three pills a day. She called her doctor knowing that she had shingles and how scared she is with medicine, the doctor assured her she could get the COVID-19 shot as scheduled. The medicine for shingles (acyclovir) was finished up the Friday before she received the COVID-19 vaccine. She got the shingles shot at 60 but everybody is now saying to get the new shot for shingles which she has never done obviously since she got the shingles. She plans to get the shingles shot in the summer. She is not worried about it. She took 3 pills a day and that was fine. She is fine, meaning every day she did normal things going through the whole process. She states she plans to go to the bank. She asked if anybody has reported the reaction she experienced after receiving the first dose of the Covid vaccine. She received the first dose of the vaccine last Saturday, in which within an hour and a half her &#34;brain got weird, like a psychedelic feeling and it felt like I was getting an injection in the operating room to go to sleep.&#34; On Monday she experienced, &#34;horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band.&#34; Stated that it wasn&#39;t a horse feeling. Her hands and fingers would pull and contort in different positions, in which they would remain tight and stay in that position, and then she would be able to make a closed fist. On Monday night, her left arm contorted (which is not administration arm) and her muscle became really tight from her elbow to her wrist leading to her hand contorting as well. She describes the muscle tension as if a rubber band was being pulled, it would have burst. This muscle pulling hurt, in which she took 3 ibuprofen (ADVIL). She has crazy reactions with almost anything that she takes. She has never smoked or drank. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19: unknown on an unspecified date and unknown on Mar2020, SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of gas (flatulence), muscles became tight/contort, minor nausea, horrible palsy, as if her muscle was being pulled like a rubber band and shingles. The outcome of the event &#39;the worse bowel movement. She had to go the bathroom a lot&#39; was not recovered while of the rest of the events was unknown.

This consumer reported for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EN5318 and expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 02Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Type 1 diabetic; Alzheimers from 2014 and ongoing, about 7 years ago; and covid-19 from Dec2020 to Dec2020. There were no concomitant medications. At 4 am yesterday morning (03Feb2021), she developed side effects. The patient&#39;s husband woke up at 4 am and touched the patient to make sure she was okay like he does every night. When he did, patient was really really hot. He took her temperature it was 101.8. She was almost comatose, and he couldn&#39;t get a response from her. He gave her fluid with a straw on her lips. At 7:30 am, 3.5 hours later, she was still hot. He was putting cold compresses on her. He called the hospice nurse, and she came and checked her vitals. She had a fever of 101.5 that time. He continued cold compresses. Her vitals were stable. Then about afternoon, her fever broke, and she became coherent. The rest of yesterday, and today she seems to be fine. She had a side effect that caused her to have a fever and be out of it. He couldn&#39;t get a response from her until noon yesterday. When the fever broke around noon, that is when she became more responsive and back to normal. Outcome of the events was recovered on 03Feb2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021156644 same reporter/drug, different patient/event

Morning after chills, neck stiffness, pain back of head left side. Applied heating pad to neck. By late morning I was nauseous , and weak as a kitten. Took a 500 mg Tylenol and slept for about 4 hours. Woke up in a sweat but chills gone and am now able to eat a little bit. Back of head and neck still very sore.   The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid/ left upper arm in the shoulder on 26Jan2021 around 14:00 (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: stroke about 4-5 years ago in June, dizziness, blood pressure. The patient also had difficulty writing stuff down; besides having a number issue, she had issues writing numbers down. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from an unspecified date and ongoing as a blood thinner. The patient stated she was on ten different medications. These medications were added after the stroke. Before the stroke she was not on any medication. The patient did not have any vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient got the pneumonia vaccine (unspecified), but thinks it was longer than 4 weeks before. She did not remember, but she believed it had been a month and a half to 2 months (at the age of 73-years-old) since getting the pneumonia vaccine for immunization. The patient had the COVID shot on Tuesday of this week (26Jan2021), and she didn&#39;t seem to have much of a reaction other than what they expected except at 21:00 that night, she got pretty dizzy. She was still dizzy now. It was enough for her to have to walk with a cane in order to try and keep herself leveled. She could not move quickly. She did not know why she had this reaction. She called her doctor the next day, and he did not understand why. She mentioned she was reading material and saw this could be a severe side effect/situation. The doctor mentioned they were trying to find out if it was related to the blood pressure. She wanted to know if this is part of the side effect, dizziness? When the patient was attempting to provide the zip code, she stated her mind was going blank and could not remember the zip code. She later found something with it written on it and provided those details.  She explained she had a stroke when trying to provide her current age. She stated numbers are hard for her. She stated she would be 74 in March, and questioned how old that would make her now, she later confirmed as 73. She read information today about the COVID vaccine, and she saw that one should be cautious about the vaccine if have a bleeding disorder, and she commented she was on a blood thinner. She went to the doctor last week and mentioned she was having dizziness. She clarified she had dizziness before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. When she went to the doctor, they thought it was due to blood pressure as the problem. They changed her blood pressure medication by placing on a higher dose. Then she started having more dizziness, and the dose was taken back down to the dose she was on before. She also added, she has an irregular heartbeat (unspecified date). She went to the doctor because of congestion in the chest (unspecified date); that was why she went to the doctor. The doctor asked about dizziness and she said she was having a little. However, the dizziness she was having and feeling now after getting the vaccine was definitely more noticeable. The clinical outcome of dizzy was recovering (as reported). The outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Lightheaded/Dizziness within a few minutes of injection; This is spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6205, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 26Feb2021 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced lightheaded/dizziness within a few minutes of injection on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM.  The event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient received unspecified treatment for the event following evaluation/transport to hospital. It was unknown if the patient received other vaccine in four weeks. It was unknown if patient had COVID prior to vaccination and if tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of the event was unknown. The event was assessed as serious (hospitalization).   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for event dizziness. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                TIA; I felt really lousy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203), dose 2 at the age of 73-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure (don&#39;t have really high blood pressure but the doctor has her on blood pressure medicine, have no diabetes or whatever, and had allergies. Concomitant medication included amlodipine besylate 5 mg, taken every morning. She takes most of her medicines in the morning and had taken that stuff at about 5 o&#39;clock or so early in the morning. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Feb2021 at the age of 73-year-old and hand no problem. The patient stated that when she had the first COVID vaccination she had no problem and then Friday she went to get the second one, it was 3 weeks later, when she had first one she stated that she had allergies, so they had her wait 15 minutes, no problem. When she went for the second one, thankfully someone drove her that was outside the &#39;game court&#39; location. When they gave it they said, she pull up and will let her know after she pull up and will decide if she has to wait 15 minutes or 30 minutes and they asked her if she had allergies, and she said yes, they said pull over here and she has to wait 30 minutes and all she know was, it&#39;s probably 2 minutes from the time she got the vaccine until she got to the place to wait. She would say 15 minutes after she got it on 26Feb2021, she felt really lousy and told her friend, they &#39;said&#39; she was having a Trans Ischemic Attack (TIA), and took me to the hospital and everything. An ambulance was called on 26Feb2021 at around 8 o&#39;clock that morning, right after she had the vaccine and carried her straight in the hospital. She was discharged the next day 27Feb2021 at about 7 PM. The patient had a CT scan of her brain, MRI of her brain, and then cardial, something with reference to her heart, she forgot, all with unknown results. The body weight right now was about 150 pounds. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received her second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot EL3248, expiration Apr2021) at 6:00AM on 07Jan2021 for Covid-19 immunization. The patient had her first dose on 19Dec2020 and had side effects from it but very few. The patient was worked at COVID rooms to clean rooms in hospital as a housekeeper and so her exposer to the hospital made her in first group to get the vaccine. Medical history included allergies (had anaphylactic shock from Amoxicillin and from Tylenol, she cannot take Tylenol), anxiety, and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) on regular basis, bisoprolol fumarate, loratadine (CLARITIN) for allergies, escitalopram for anxiety, mometasone furoate (FLONASE) for allergies, losartan, magnesium, omeprazole, and triamterene. On the first day (07Jan2021) she had soreness more than usual from the shot, soreness in her arm, her neck. She got stiff neck, back, lower back. She had gotten the shot at 6 am, then worked at that time and by the time she got home at noon, she had massive weakness, some confusion, terrible sleepiness and by evening, she developed diarrhea. On the second day (08Jan2021) the pain increased the weakness increased, and she was running a temperature of 102. She could not even sit on the side of bed without falling to one side or the other or falling backwards so very weak and unable to move pretty much. She could not eat and lost appetite, and she developed the chills on that evening. On the third day (09Jan2021) she was running a temperature of 101 so it had gone down. She still had headaches, and pain around her face, her left arm and developed severe itching from head to toe, and on the next day (10Jan2021) she developed hives on her face, on her head, on top of her back and they also itch in addition to the all over itching. The temperature was gone, she had no temperature when she developed the hives. At the report day, she stated that she had not gone back to work as she broke out in the horrible hives and she still did not feel good. Only cold ice packs on the hives/ itching and no more treatment received for the events. The fever and itching resolved on 10Jan2021, and outcome of all other events was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccine (because she&#39;s 74 and high risk). Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included irbesartan oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date (maybe 3 years ago) and ongoing at 300 mg once daily (150mg, 2 tablets once a day in the morning) for hypertension as blood pressure medication. The patient received the first dose of vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021) morning (AM) at 10 at the county (public) health department. She had no problem at all until yesterday Tuesday, she experienced mild swelling; the swelling happened in the upper left arm (swelling of left arm) which started on 12Jan2021, this was also the same side that she got her vaccine on, the left arm. On 13Jan2021 she woke up at 4AM [also reported as thirty (30) hours after the shot] in which she started to have severe chills (horrendous chills), could not get warm under the blanket for an hour and a half. It lasted a long time. Her severe chills did stop, she used an electric (heated) blanket. This morning on 13Jan2021 at 8:30, she woke up with the fever, which she was able to reduce with acetaminophen (did take two acetaminophen). Her fever was also gone. She was a little concerned because she thought her breathing was deep too on 13Jan2021. She did some relaxing breathing which helped. It lasted a long time. The patient also experienced a drop in blood pressure on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running the past few days at 133/80 on 11Jan2021. Today (13Jan2021), she took her blood pressure and it was at 93/50. It went to 87/56 after drinking some salty soup on 13Jan2021 (the bottom number in the blood pressure was going up a little, and the top number was going down a little). Her blood pressure has been normal 133/70 on Jan2021, but this morning it was 90/50 on 13Jan2021. Her blood pressure has been running normal the last couple of days like 133/90 on Jan2021. She was shocked it was lower. She knew they talk about dizziness and weakness, but she didn&#39;t experience that. She was concerned about that sudden drop in blood pressure. She did some research and started eating some salty soup and stuff (has been drinking salty soup). Her bottom number went up to 53 on Jan2021. She was concerned about that drop there. She was wondering if that was a side effect of the vaccine (result of the vaccine). She asked if drop in blood pressure was a concern. She had no positive test for Covid before the vaccine. She never had any tested, she&#39;s been pretty isolated. She had no antibody test. She has had no issues with vaccine in the past. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of severe chills/could not get warm, fever, her breathing was deep, and drop in blood pressure. The outcome of swelling of left arm/mild swelling and drop in blood pressure was not recovered; of severe chills/could not get warm was recovered on 13Jan2021 05:30 and fever was recovered on 13Jan2021; and of her breathing was deep was recovering.

                                                Severe urgent diarrhea; Feels like she might be getting a little fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-year-old female patient  received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid (shoulder) on 15Jan2021 at around 10:30-10:40 AM at a single dose  for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, problems with her colon, back surgery, and flashes.  Concomitant medications included ibuprofen given on unspecified date for back surgery, and unspecified hormones, vitamins, and laxatives.  The patient previously received the flu vaccine on unspecified date and experienced like she got the flu and relapse of her chronic fatigue syndrome. She also received hepatitis C vaccine, hepatitis B vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, and shingles vaccine; all on unspecified dates. The patient had not received prior vaccinations within four weeks. On 15Jan2021, the patient experienced severe urgent diarrhea and felt like she might be getting a little fever. It was further described as: Patient had an odd reaction within maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour after that dose was administered of severe urgent diarrhea. Patient mentioned she felt like she might be getting a little fever; but she was not sure and did not have a thermometer to check that. Severe urgent diarrhea: She mentioned she had not seen that side effect posted anywhere for the vaccine so she felt it was an odd reaction; although she did see that it was a side effect of the virus, so maybe it was not that odd of a reaction for the vaccine now that she thought about it. She described this event as completely crazy, the urgency to go to the bathroom, she almost did not make it home to the bathroom. It just hit her like she has never experienced before. It cleaned out her colon really well. She also felt like she might be getting a little fever but mentioned that at her age she gets hormone flashes so it could be that; and was humid at the time of report and thought so it could just be from that. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information regarding Batch/ Lot number has been requested.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

She says she was told to see if anyone else reported this, she expected normal stuff like, flu stuff, this is not that. She says she is on her way to urgent care to have that looked at. She asks if condition persists, she is supposed to get her second dose on 12Feb, does she get it?

She says to add to this, which she talked to two doctors (docs) who said it was unrelated, that night she had a cut to the top of the roof of her mouth that had uncontrollable bleeding, she went to the emergency room for that and got a shot to help her coagulate blood, and will be seeing an ENT so hopefully that will be under control. No further details provided about shot to help her coagulate blood. She got the flu shot but that was Thanksgiving, way back, not recent. She is going to get her sinuses checked out, they did a CAT scan yesterday, and is going to the doctor for that 1Feb. She is concerned that the breast pain started last Saturday and is still really painful, she doesn&#39;t know why all of a sudden that happened, so she is going to the urgent care to see if they can do something for it, and will be getting an appointment with her OBGYN. For her right breast hurting, she took Tylenol and Ibuprofen, that is all she has done. Tylenol, LOT: PPAO33, EXP: Sep2022. Ibuprofen, LOT: 113132.

After receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, medically, she seemed fine. Then, she progressively has gotten worse. First EMS was called. This was about less than a week later after receiving the vaccine. Then, she was admitted into the hospital with a kidney infection and she has progressively declined. She has no idea if it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine or not. She initially called regarding the second COVID-19 vaccine. She didn&#39;t know what would happen if her mother didn&#39;t show up for her second vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if she would get on the &#34;never going to get the vaccine&#34; list or what as her mother was just so unstable. On an unspecified date, her blood pressure was so low right now they can&#39;t even transfer her to the hospital that can perform the surgery she needs. The reporter stated that she has no idea if this was COVID related or what. She began having problems less than a week later after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, she mentioned Wednesday. On 27Jan2021, her mother began having issues with her kidneys and has progressively declined since. Consumer stated her mother was swollen from head to toe with edema on an unspecified date and that was how this all kind of started. Her mother became very weak and didn&#39;t tell anyone. She fell using her walker on Wednesday and the EMS was called. Her mother told the EMS she wasn&#39;t hurt but was just too weak to get up and EMS got her up.  Her primary care doctor sent her for an x-ray, and she had some wheezing in her chest. She was given an antibiotic for that. The patient fell again, and the EMS was called and had some face lacerations and stuff, so she was taken to the hospital. Consumer confirmed her mother was admitted into the hospital and was first diagnosed with a kidney infection and it has progressively gotten worse. Outcome of event kidney infection was not recovered; and outcome of the rest of events was unknown.  Information on lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Bad headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 74-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EL8920, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COVID from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that she had a very slight case of COVID in Nov2020 and her family doctor told her about three weeks ago that she needed to get the vaccine. However, he did not tell the patient that she needed to wait 90 days from when she had COVID (as reported). So, she got the Pfizer vaccine about two months and a week after she had COVID itself. Ever since about five days after she had the vaccine, on an unspecified date in Jan2021, she came down with a bad headache and have had a headache since that day. She is on day nine of a headache and this is the headache that require medication. It is not the headache that you think is going way because it has not. She wanted to know if she got the headache because she got the vaccine too soon after having COVID. The patient got medicine for the headache because she had to go to the emergency room for the event. She had blood work done on an unspecified date but had unknown results. The outcome of the event was unknown.

A 74-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246) via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 15:30 in left arm at single dose as Covid vaccine, etanercept (ENBREL, 50 mL/mg, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen, lot number: 1119808, expiry date: Apr2023) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at 1 DF weekly to the stomach area for rheumatoid arthritis, methylprednisolone (MEDROL, tablet) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 3 mg, daily (1.5 tablets daily for total of 3 mg) for rheumatoid arthritis, methotrexate (tablets) oral from an unspecified date and ongoing at 20 mg, weekly (2.5 mg tablets, 20 mg total) for rheumatoid arthritis. Medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity) and took levothyroxine, rheumatoid arthritis. She had had regular blood work for rheumatoid arthritis and that was normal for her, they were relatively normal and her ESR was down. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine daily for endocrine abnormalities. It was a daily thing for the body and the body couldn&#39;t live without it if it did not have it. The patient previously took the Shingrix vaccine and it was terrible for her and put her into a rheumatoid arthritis flare and was taking prednisone and was getting better and the wap she was in a rheumatoid flare. No prior vaccinations received within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient was taking 3 medicines for rheumatoid arthritis that might or might not affect the RNA in the vaccine. She wondered if etanercept would have an effect on the vaccine since it was shipped on ice overnight. She did not think they would affect anything. Nobody has said anything about the medications and she just wanted to get the vaccine. Her doctor knows nothing about the interactions and none of them seem to know if it is normal to have these symptoms 4 days after getting the vaccine. She felt great the first 2 days after getting the vaccine and then began to feel a little bad. She was having some symptoms maybe 4 days on 01Feb2021 after receiving the Covid vaccine and wanted to know if that was sort of normal. It was unusual for her, but she had nauseous, not dizziness, but unsteadiness, tired, also headaches and generally didn&#39;t feel well. She felt like she might have the stomach flu, but had not had that in so many years. She also felt weak. No temperature. Gentle muscle ache. On 01Feb2021 Monday night she had the nausea. On 02Feb2021 Tuesday, she had it again, and had it again today and almost threw up last night. Just the malaise or tiredness had gotten worse. She could not tell the difference between the rheumatoid arthritis, joint pain and muscle pain and this with the vaccine. She was having a few little odd pains, but nothing that she hadn&#39;t had before. It was more of a soft pain, they made her feel weak and then they went away. It was more muscle than joint. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. She was supposed to get a second dose but felt she shouldn&#39;t, it might put her back into a rheumatoid flare. She was just getting over it and afraid to go through that with the Covid vaccine also. The action taken in response to the events for etanercept, methylprednisolone and methotrexate was dose not changed. The outcome of events nausea, unsteadiness, tired (tired was reported as worsened), generally does not feel well, feels like the stomach flu, weak, few little odd pains; soft pain, joint pain was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

                                                I began feeling deeply fatigued and achy about six hours after the vaccination and went to bed.  The aches and fatigue continued the next day and evening and, additionally, I had a swelling in my left wrist of the arm that I had the shot in.  That swelling was painful; it  was about an inch across and looked like it contained fluid.  All those symptoms continued for two more days and then the swelling began to subside and is now gone..  Today, the morning of the fifth day after the vaccination, I awoke at 3 a.m. with severe body aches, took two Tylenol and eventually was able to sleep again.  I am feeling better but very, very tired and have some bodyaches and headache but not as severe.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

When she woke up at 8:30 AM her headache was very severe and was accompanied with very severe chest pain. She immediately took her to the ER. They did a very thorough work up to check on her heart and Aorta. They managed her severe pain with two doses of morphine followed by two days of Dilaudid. The imaging and symptoms left her with a newly discovered diagnosis of Pericarditis. The medical professions were sure this was a result of the COVID vaccine. They continued to treat her for a few days and sent her home with anti inflammatories to help. She continues to have muscle pain, weakness and shortness of breath when she walks. She is scheduled to take her 2nd dose on February 5th but we are very concerned and hesitant as we don&#39;t want to cause any more damage to her heart. The patient was hospitalized for events &#39;headache&#39;, &#39;chest pain;&#39;, &#39;pericarditis&#39; and &#39;pain&#39; for 4 days. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and did not received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included imaging: pericarditis on 16Jan2021 and Nasal Swab: negative on 16Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events which included Colchicine and prednisone, morphine and dilaudid. The outcome of the events was recovering. The events &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;chest pain&#34;, &#34;pericarditis&#34;and &#34;severe pain&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and disability.

                                                75-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room 2 days after vaccination with chest tightness, fatigue and was found to have pericardial effusion without tamponade.  It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.

                                                About 11 am I was masked in church and developed a tickle in my throat.  I cleared my throat to no relief.  I took 2 cough drops. About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date (lot EL8982) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in the right arm. The patient experienced mild fever on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 14Feb2021, roof of mouth itching on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, muscle ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 12Feb2021, joint ache on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, breathing problems on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, rapid heart rate up to 130 on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, itchy skin on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Feb2021, it showed a &#34;crp value&#34; of 11.5 which is usually below 0.29 on 15Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, nausea on 12Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, loss of appetite on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 13Feb2021, eyes were also really sore on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 15Feb2021. An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.
