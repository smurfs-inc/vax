                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in right arm, on 26Jan2021 at 07:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included birth control pill. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel (CRYSELLE) from 26Jan2021 as birth control pill. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Jan2021 at 08:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization (in right arm). The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. The patient was a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a hospital. The patient and her mother both work at the same hospital that administered their COVID-19 vaccines, both received the first and second COVID-19 vaccines at the same date and time. The patient received her second COVID-19 vaccine dose yesterday (26Jan2021). Since 26Jan2021 around 09:00 PM, the patient was experiencing symptoms of chills, headache, fever, and nausea. The patient had a fever, clarifying that the highest temperature was 101.4 degrees, and also has chills and headache. Last night (26Jan2021 at 09:00 PM), the patient&#39;s stomach was not feeling right, had a low-grade temperature, and chills. On this morning (27Jan2021), the patient was throwing up. The patient didn&#39;t throw up until this morning and has vomited 4 times today. The patient has not sought medical treatment from an emergency room or doctor yet. The patient has been throwing up today. If the patient continues throwing up, and becomes dehydrated, she may need to go the emergency room. It was also reported that the patient started ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel last night. The patient&#39;s mother thought that the patient&#39;s initial stomach upset may have been caused by the ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and fever including ibuprofen and acetaminophen; the patient isn&#39;t taking anything for nausea at this time. The patient&#39;s mother wanted to see if anyone else had been reporting these side effects the patient has been experiencing since receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine dose. The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter explained that the patient&#39;s adverse events &#34;started as expected&#34; with a  headache side effect (date not specified), however two days after the vaccine, while working as an EMT the patient became very dizzy and had to stop work. She remained dizzy, like vertigo, the next day but attempted to go to work. Her co-worker could see she wasn&#39;t right and took her to the hospital. The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.  The patient was tested for COIVD-19 after the vaccination, on 28Jan2021, and was found to be negative.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

They made my crew take me to the ER. When they took my vitals my O2 was 88% and they put me on 4lpm, HR was upper 110s and my BP was 160s/100s... The next day I couldn?t walk, keep my eyes open, had a headache, my whole body was aching and sore. I ended up sleeping for over 20 hours that day, couldn?t eat my husband had to actually help me walk to the shower and bathe me because I kept almost passing out.

Then they called EMS who transported her to the hospital where she was admitted to the hospital. Outcome of events was unknown. This report was considered as serious per caused/prolonged hospitalization.  Causality: Cannot jump to that conclusion.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events dizziness, throat irritation, cough and pharyngeal swelling cannot be excluded.

                                                chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient. A 21-year old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number: EL0142, intramuscularly in the left deltoid on 06Jan2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 21-years-old) at 0.3 &#34;mg&#34; as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included birth control use and obesity. Concomitant medications included ongoing ethinylestradiol/norgestimate (SPRINTEC) tablet for birth control. The patient did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA) 27 mg and experienced lack of appetite and was still having sleepiness (insomnia she guessed) and therefore was dropped to 18 mg and still had side effects; as well as guanfacine. On 07Jan2021 at 21:00, the patient experienced chills. She thought it was just her mom&#39;s house being cold, but she had a little bit of a chill all day today (08Jan2021). She didn&#39;t have a fever. The last time she took her temperature it was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which was normal for her. The caller stated she did have a slower metabolism when it came to medication. She didn&#39;t know 100% if she hadn&#39;t been exposed to COVID, as she worked in healthcare and worked last on Monday. The event, chills, did not prompt an emergency room or physician office visit. The caller was worried if this was a normal side effect of the vaccine or if she was getting sick with COVID. She would go through with the COVID test she had scheduled for &#34;tomorrow morning&#34; as she was still experiencing side effects. The chills stayed the same or were a little worse. The clinical outcome of chills was not resolved.

She gets twice weekly for work, and she tested negative (COVID) on Friday (08Jan2021).  Patient asked if this was normal to be developing symptoms that late after the vaccine. She just wanted to know if what she was experiencing was normal because she was freaked out about it. She works on a COVID unit and wears a lot of PPE. She started to experience symptoms after 3-4 days after getting the vaccine. She wanted to know if it was normal to take that long to feel side effects or should she be worried about actually having COVID. There was no prescriber. She had it as a part of work. When it rolled out, they were a part of it and if you work on COVID unit, they said you should get it. She got the vaccine on Tuesday, 05Jan2021, and started feeling symptoms on Friday, 08Jan2021.

Since then she will wake up in the morning with a slight headache. Soreness in arm was when it was first administered (05Jan2021), that was normal and she usually gets soreness no matter what vaccines she gets. This lasted for 2 days and then went away. She did say that the flu vaccine and some other that she did not remember the name of were the ones she remembered getting sore from. She did not have a manufacturer, lot or expiration for any of them. The fourth day was when she had a sore throat and coughing, that started in the morning when she woke up around 10:00. She had it all day yesterday and it was pretty severe and then she started getting better later in the night. Today it was less, but still here. She did take something to try and make herself feel better, so it definitely helped. Loose stool improved and today (12Jan2021) was yet to be known. Loose stool started in the afternoon of 06Jan2021.

I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

I took my temperature around 1 pm today and had a fever of 100.8. Throughout today, my headache has gotten progressively worse. The pain is sharp at the base of my head and radiates down my spine. I cannot put my chin to my chest without excruciating pain. I have had migraines before and this does not feel the same. This headache is more localized in the back of my head and spine. I also have had COVID19 before at the beginning of July 2020 from which the only symptom I had was a loss of smell which returned 2 weeks after my positive COVID test.

Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she got the vaccine at 10:30AM on 30Dec2020, and started to have a feeling of dizziness, nausea, and being clammy about 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine. The patient hasn&#39;t done any treatment for these yet. It was also mentioned that dizziness, nausea, and being clammy has pretty much gotten worse (not recovered).   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) intramuscular at left deltoid on 22Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines given at the same time. The patient received a flu shot back between 27th or 28th Nov2020 in her left deltoid. Caller reported getting the COVID vaccine on the 22Dec2020 and feeling fine before that. On the 28Dec2020 she started feeling chills and not feeling very good and that hasn&#39;t gone away. The patient went and got a rapid COVID test and it came back positive, not sure if it was because of the vaccine having antigens in it or she came into contact with it or if she just weakened immune system from the shot. The patient wanted to know if that was true. Then stated she and her mom got the COVID vaccine and her mom received it on the 23Dec. On the 29Dec her whole family started to get sick and experiencing the same things she experienced. The patient was not feeling well at the time of the call. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021001266 same reporter/ drug, different patient/event

She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.  She is not hypoxic, has clear breath sounds.  No thrombocytopenia on CBC.  IV was placed, IV fluids given.  Heart rate improved, blood pressure remained stable.  Patient feels well enough for discharge on reevaluation and declined need for analgesic or antipyretic here.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird.

                                                Three hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feel extremely tired and had a headache. Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

I was not allowed to return to work until I was fever free for 24 hours and tested negative for COVID-19 infection. I was swabbed at my place of employment, Hospital and my NP sample was run.  I tested negative on 1/13/21. I then returned to work on 1/14/21.

                                                Vaccines received in series on 12/11/20 and 1/11/21. Three days before due date for second COVID vaccine, started severely itching and experiencing hive-like rash all over body, especially to hands and head; mostly relieved by benadryl but wore off every 6 hours. Contacted PCP (listed in form) who suggested taking zyrtec and using a moisturizing lotion. This helped for the day of receiving the vaccine. Thinking it was something unrelated due to the time elapsed from the vaccine, despite no changes in consumption or products/environment encountered, I went ahead and got the second vaccine. Day 1 after vaccine, I experienced the usually reported side effects, including slightly elevated temp, chills, and body aches. Itching and hives continued but not as noticeable due to other side effects. The next morning, hives and itching were significantly worse; any time I scratched (or something touched my skin more than lightly), large, red welps would nearly immediately develop, and often had raised bumps within the irritations. To date, this is continued, slightly relieved by allergy medications, but not entirely and must be taken around the clock or severe symptoms will begin again.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

                                                About 10-15 minutes after shot,  I developed a large red splotchy rash on my chest and it started spreading up my neck and face. I also felt dizzy, a little numbness and tingling and very cold/ shaky. I was given a total of 50 mg of Benadryl PO. 25 mg immediately and then an additional 25 mg about 30 minutes later. About 15 minutes after my second dose of Benadryl my rash started to subside and I began feeling better. ADTER about an hour I felt back to my baseline.

Slept for 10-12 hours. Woke up fine, had no issues or symptoms. Later on as the day progressed, around noon-1pm, I noticed I had started to get a headache and some dizziness. Daily headaches and vertigo are normal for me, currently seeing a neurologist for this, but I realized that this was getting worse from the daily headaches and vertigo that affects me. Took 2 Excedrin extra strength migraine relief to no relief.

The day after that, my temperature was back to normal (98.1 F), no headache, and the soreness had subsided significantly, but I am experiencing some swelling and soreness in my right armpit.

She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

However after this second dose on 1/7 I experienced moderately severe chills, achy feelings, sore throat, and headache lasting from about 7am until I took ibuprofen at 5pm. The symptoms subsided after taking ibuprofen.

                                                Immediately after vaccine I had a bad headache which was cleared up with Ibuprofen. Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

                                                Around Midnight, the night following the second COVID-19 vaccine I started to become ill with feverish chills and nausea and puking. The nausea and puking went away a couple of hours after it started, so it could have been related to dinner. But the feverish chills continued well into the following day, Sunday 1/10. Sunday morning I woke up still  feverish with a temp of 99.7, and also achy with a slight sore throat. I drank plenty of fluids and napped during the day of 1/10 to break the fever, followed with day-quil and ny-quil at night. On Monday, 1/11 I woke up feeling much improved and no longer felt ill.

By the morning headache subsided after a OTC Tylenol tablet but fatigue remained.

                                                I received the vaccine on 12/29 at approximately 12:30 pm. On 12/31 I woke up with itching in my scalp. On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Woke up at 5am with body aches and headache. Sat on the toilet but felt dizzy, had ringing in my ears, and felt woosy. Laid  back on bed and raised feet above my head. Took my temperature, it was 99.3F, which is a little high for me.  Ringing stopped after I laid down.

Side effects of muscle aches/chills subsided after 48 hours. Fever was less than 100F after 48 hours, so I returned to work per protocol. Was taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen.    3rd day: afebrile but headache remained. Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen to help manage.   4th day: intermittent fevers throughout day (no higher than 100.3F). headache continues.   5th day: afebrile in the morning, but as day progressed headache began to get worse and I eventually spiked a low grade fever as high as 101.5F that afternoon. I was excused from work per protocol and receiving care/evaluation from occupational heath and infectious disease for return to work purposes. Still taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen which were helping the fevers stay between 99F but not helping the headaches.   6th day: Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen around the clock. Fevers have ranged from 98.9-100.8F so far. Headache still remains.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL3248) via an unspecified route of administration on right arm on 11Jan2021 06:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included nail patella syndrome. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (LESSINA), escitalopram. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had not COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not COVID tested post vaccination. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced allergies. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Brand: Pfizer, Lot number: EH9899) on right arm on 21Dec2020 16:00 PM for COVID-19 immunisation. First dose came with moderate muscle fatigue and joint pain, chills, headache and fatigue.  Events occurred 7 days post vaccination. Second dose had almost immediate side effects beginning post vaccination beginning with headache, then muscle soreness. Followed by severe joint pain and muscle tightness, including chest pain. Moderate chills. Exhaustion. Both instances were elevated with ibuprofen, water, and a night&#39;s rest. Upon waking after second dose side effects, muscle soreness and knots probably from muscle tightness night before. A muscle relaxant might have helped. All events started from 11Jan2021 17:00. No treatment received for muscle tightness and muscle disorder, treatment was received for the other remain events. The outcome of the event was recovering.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid, on 29Dec2020 at 18:40 (at the age of 25-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.

She saw a dermatologist for the hives on 07Jan2021, who suspected that since she did not have any prior history of hives, her hives are from the COVID-19 vaccine. She said the dermatologist told her there is no way to truly test if the vaccine caused her hives. The patient received an intramuscular unspecified steroid shot at the dermatologist and was prescribed methylprednisolone (MANUFACTURED BY: PAR PHARMACEUTICAL; Lot number: 1129091; Expiration date: Dec2021) 4 mg tablets in a taper dose pack. She also stated that she took the following over-the-counter medications: diphenhydramine hydrochloride (reported as: generic BENADRYL; MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN; Lot number: 0MR0456; Expiration date: Sep2022) 25 mg tablet, taken as needed; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC; Lot number: 1652346; Expiration Date: Dec2021) 10 mg tablet, taken as one tablet up to four times a day; and hydrocortisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) cream.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received my vaccination on 2/13/21. For a few days, I experienced severe arm pain like experienced for about two days. However starting this weekend on 2/20/21, a week after the vaccine, my arm will occasionally throb and hurt in the same area that I received the injection. The pain and throbbing last for about 10 seconds and appear to occur at random. On a pain scale, I would say it&#39;s about a 3 out of 10. After the throbbing, I experience a general sense of discomfort in the area that lasts about an hour or two but that is no longer painful

                                                fatigue; Throat tightness; sore throat; Rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 25-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 06Mar2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6025) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Penicillin. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), took the week prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced rash (Amoxicillin tablets. Had allergic reaction when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime).   The patient experienced sore throat, throat tightness and rash, all on 06Mar2021 14:30. Clinical course: After receiving COVID 19 Vaccine, within one to two minutes of vaccine very strong sore throat and tightening of the throat. Was taken to emergency room by the ambulance that was at the testing center. At that time the ambulance at testing center recommended taking two Benadryl&#39;s, which started to work and sore throat and tightness completely went away about 15 minutes after that and then started to come back at time of riding in ambulance to the ER. While being written up and vitals checked, the rash (blotchy) developed to which she was given a Solumedrol steroid shot to fix the rash which amazingly cleared up rash and it ended up back to white. Had amazing clear photos of rash and it being red and sloshes starting to appear. After caller left ER and went home and had couple of follow up prescriptions of Pepcid and Atarax to help combat rash for two days. Now she was taking Allegra still for adverse events. Reporter mentioned sore throat was on and off but it had improved and still had a little bit of a rash. Caller had a little bit of tightness and it had improved if she exerted herself a lot the tightness got worse she wsn&#39;t referring to a big exertion but provided example like if she is going to the grocery store. The rash was severely reduced but was apparent. Caller also mentioned she had pretty severe fatigue after receiving vaccine unsure if this was because of the vaccine or an allergic reaction to some medication in her. She missed work on Monday and part time on Tuesday due to having to take breaks and naps during the day. Caller went into work but she did not feel up to working a full day in the office and was working remotely from home right now. The patient had allergic reaction to amoxicillin tablets when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime. Caller stated she knew how important it is to report not sure if there is an association between Amoxicillin and COVID ingredients. May have another allergy that was contributing but Amoxicillin was only other known allergy. Caller was asking for the next steps since she still has not fully recovered her throat, she is still feeling sore and tighter than normal and her skin was still redder than normal. When she had the rash it was red blotchy and warm to the touch it was no longer warm to the touch. Outcome of the events sore throat, throat tightness and rash was recovering, of event fatigue was unknown.
