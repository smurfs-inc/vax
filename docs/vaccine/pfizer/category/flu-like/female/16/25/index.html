                                                Patient in clinic for chief complaint of possible side effect of the covid vaccine which she received yesterday.  She states that she woke up at 0200 with chest tightness, achyness and headache.  She rates the discomfort 7/10 last night and improved now to 5/10.  She denies any worsening with any type of exertion and states that she can do simple things like take a shower, walk across the room, down the street or even stairs without any worsening.  She denies any SOB or chest pain--just feels tight.  Doesn&#39;t feel like she can&#39;t get a full breath or get the air out of her lungs either.  She received her first of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday (4:23pm) and had no difficulty with the injection itself and then 9.5 hours later woke up from sleep with this chest tightness as well as achyness and headache.    She states that she had the exact same symptoms when she had positive covid test back in August of this year with the addition of fatigue which lasted for 5 days.  At that time it was not felt necessary to do any further testing nor treat with steroids according to cardiology.  She does have history of LV non-compaction cardiomyopathy and her last visit with cardiology was about 2 years ago and she had a normal EKG and echo only showed &#34;mild LV non compaction at the apex&#34; at that time. He did not need to see her again until she is 18 unless she has problems.  She states that she generally does very well and other than this tightness she does not have any other significant symptoms.

                                                Fever, chills, extreme fatigue, lightheadedness and very sore arm, but more importantly chest tightness that became increasingly worse over 48 hours. My daughter dealt with the other symptoms but her asthma became less treatable over the two days since the second shot. I finally administered the nebulizer and inhaled steroid today after all other treatments failed to relieve her symptoms. She is doing better but I will follow up with the pediatrician.

                                                Admitted to hospital on 4/10 with 2 day history of mydriasis, diplopia with blurry vision, dizziness and balance difficulty. Found to have enhancement of 6th and 3rd CNs on MRI. Patient continued to have blurry and double vision during her stay and mild gait instability. She developed mild frontal headache managed with Tylenol. Her exam was remarkable for mydriasis, mild lateral gaze limitation R&gt;L, mild dysmetria, dizziness and unsteady gait without notable ataxia. No papilledema. Her reflexes were 2&#43; in her BL UE and LEs.  Pediatric Neurology and ophthalmology consulted and followed patient. Eye exam remarkable for bilateral cranial nerve 6 palsy but no other element of CN3 palsy and bilateral dilated but unreactive pupils. Patient treated with IVIG 1mg/kg/day x2 days for likely miller fisher syndrome variant of Guillain-Barre.

                                                My daughter had her vaccine at 6:15 on 4/7/21. She complained of a horrible soreness in the site of the shot, headache, and fatigue. Those were her only symptoms. I gave her ibuprofen. She stayed home from school and rested. I checked on her, and she said her headache was getting better. She had a seizure at work around 4:15 pm on 4/8/21. Her co-workers called 911, and the ambulance took her to the Medical Center. They did a head CT and ran labs. They were unsure if she had passed out or had a seizure. They gave her ibuprofen for the headache and told us to follow up with our PCP and monitor her for the weekend. She had another seizure on 4/8/21 at 10:30 pm. We called 911, and they took her to the Medical center again. They gave her Keppra and called a hospital to see if they wanted her transferred. The hospital said to provide her with the Keppra, follow up with them on Monday the 4/12/21, plus sent us home with a prescription for Keppra. They sent us home at 2:00 am on 4/9/21. I gave her the Keppra at 10:30 am on 4/9/21. She had another three seizures back to back. The EMT had to provide her with something to stop the seizures because I could tell she was about to have another one. They took her to the hospital, where she continued to have several episodes in the ER. They admitted her and gave her a higher dose of Keppra. They hooked her up to an EEG and determined that the seizure, not epileptic seizures, was brought on by stress. They released her from the hospital on 4/11/21. They told us that we needed to reduce her stress and follow-up with Neurology on 4/12/21. We could give her ibuprofen and Benedryl for the pain. She has several seizures a day, and is having numbness on her left side which they knew before releasing her. Her headache has never gone away. I keep telling them she has a horrible headache and the more seizures she is having the worse they get throughout the day. On 4/11/21, she had 17 episodes total and Monday, 4/12/21,  21 episodes. On 4/13/21, we took her back to the ER but this time took her to a different hospital. They were not able to treat because they wanted her to be seen by a pediatric neurologist. The hospital transferred her to another hospital. Where she was admitted on 4/13/21 and once again ran labs and hooked her up to an EEG. They told us they are not epileptic events and don&#39;t worry. They treated her for a chronic migraine. Sent her home telling us to give 3 ibuprophen, 2 Benedryl, and 1 Reglan every six hours until the headache is gone. She still has a severe headache and having seizures.

An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in right arm, on 26Jan2021 at 07:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included birth control pill. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel (CRYSELLE) from 26Jan2021 as birth control pill. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Jan2021 at 08:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization (in right arm). The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. The patient was a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a hospital. The patient and her mother both work at the same hospital that administered their COVID-19 vaccines, both received the first and second COVID-19 vaccines at the same date and time. The patient received her second COVID-19 vaccine dose yesterday (26Jan2021). Since 26Jan2021 around 09:00 PM, the patient was experiencing symptoms of chills, headache, fever, and nausea. The patient had a fever, clarifying that the highest temperature was 101.4 degrees, and also has chills and headache. Last night (26Jan2021 at 09:00 PM), the patient&#39;s stomach was not feeling right, had a low-grade temperature, and chills. On this morning (27Jan2021), the patient was throwing up. The patient didn&#39;t throw up until this morning and has vomited 4 times today. The patient has not sought medical treatment from an emergency room or doctor yet. The patient has been throwing up today. If the patient continues throwing up, and becomes dehydrated, she may need to go the emergency room. It was also reported that the patient started ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel last night. The patient&#39;s mother thought that the patient&#39;s initial stomach upset may have been caused by the ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and fever including ibuprofen and acetaminophen; the patient isn&#39;t taking anything for nausea at this time. The patient&#39;s mother wanted to see if anyone else had been reporting these side effects the patient has been experiencing since receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine dose. The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant.

I went to my doctor and they suspected I could have appendicitis and also symptoms from the vaccine. They suggested going to the ER after 3 days if systems persisted. I went home after the doctor visit and was nauseous. I had sprite, ate white rice and chicken broth. My abdomen felt a bit better but I had a bad headache. 5/8/21 - Saturday I awoke at 6am with stabbing/burning chest pain that increased as time progressed. The chest pain was increasing and getting worse after 1 hour and 30 minutes. The pain was in the middle of my chest. My mom took me to the Emergency Room.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

                                                headaches; Confusion; Fever; muscle aches all over; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 19-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT#: EL0140), intramuscular in upper left arm on 11Jan2021 around noon at second single dose for preventative. Medical history included ongoing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, diagnosed when she was 14 or 15 years old), ongoing anxiety (Diagnosed when she was 16 years old), depression. Concomitant medication included ongoing methylphenidate (has been taking for about 4 or 5 years) for ADHD, to help focus and keeps her sane, ongoing primidone (has been taking less than a year) for hand tremors, ongoing fluvoxamine maleate (taking for about 4 years) for anxiety depression. The patient previously took first dose BNT162B2 on 21Dec2020 around noon, intramuscular injection in upper left arm for preventative (Lot: EJ1685). No other prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE following prior vaccinations. The patient got the second dose yesterday (reported on 12Jan2021) around noon and she was experiencing not so great side effects. The biggest thing was headaches that were pretty debilitating. She was experiencing confusion and muscle aches all over. Stated that all the side effects started around the same time around 9 pm last night. The patient reported that her fever was down a bit so she was a little bit more coherent. Fever was slightly improved at 101.5. The patient took a few medicines for ADHD or anxiety and was wondering if they could have interacted with the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient reported her headache with medication was slightly better, but consistently the same. Treatment for headache inclued Ibuprofen. Outcome of event headache and fever was recovering, of event muscle aches all over was not recovered, of event confusion was unknown.

Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

                                                Got second dose of vaccine the morning of March 10th.  Had the &#34;expected&#34; symptoms of fatigue, headache, and chills the evening of March 10th. Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                Roughly an hour after started getting numb feeling in the roof of my mouth. Feeling went away rather soon but was back by around 9 am the next morning. Over the course of six hours the feeling was moving into the tongue and back of throat. Throat and mouth started hurting as well.Stopped being able to swallow properly. Was given Benadryl and a steroid at urgent care and have not had any more swelling over the past two days.

Injection site soreness began immediately after the vaccine, but is normal for me. Everything else began at time listed on this form (1/25/2021 afternoon) and ended by the following morning. I took one Tylenol to help with the chills and pain about 5 hours after symptoms started and it seemed to help a little.

                                                Received the shot at 2:10.  2:15, she was feeling light headed and tingly sensation in her extremities. She didn&#39;t let anyone know at this time.  The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

Morning had a severe migraine. Took Tylenol and a nap and I felt my fever break.  Had that fever from 4am until 11:30am. Had headache for the rest of the day until 7pm but was not a migraine after the nap and Tylenol. I would never get this vaccine again. I would rather have covid 1000 more times. (I had it in October and no sickness I?ve ever had will ever compare to that two hours of hell.

A 20-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included allergy to eggs. Historical vaccination included the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number unknown ), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 10:30 AM (at the age of 20-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The vaccine was administered in a hospital. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter explained that the patient&#39;s adverse events &#34;started as expected&#34; with a  headache side effect (date not specified), however two days after the vaccine, while working as an EMT the patient became very dizzy and had to stop work. She remained dizzy, like vertigo, the next day but attempted to go to work. Her co-worker could see she wasn&#39;t right and took her to the hospital. The patient spent two days in the hospital, barely able to stand, getting a head MRI with contrast, evaluated for vertigo, blood tests, and they did not find anything and gave her vertigo medicine and sent her home. She has since had shifting symptoms, swollen lymph nodes, irregular heartbeat, severe upper back and neck pain. She has barely been able to move for several weeks and has seen an ENT doctor, another emergency doctor, and her regular doctor. None have found any other cause and have tried treating her with steroids. The events were treated with Meklazine and unspecified steroids. Lab data included SARS-CoV-2 test COVID 19 testing on 28Jan2021 which was negative. The clinical outcomes of headache, dizziness, vertigo, difficulty standing, swollen glands, irregular heart rate, back pain, neck pain and unable to more for several weeks were reported as not recovered.  The patient was tested for COIVD-19 after the vaccination, on 28Jan2021, and was found to be negative.

I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

                                                Pt received Pfizer-COVID vaccine (under EUA) yesterday 16 Dec 2020 at approx 1700.  She did not have any immediate problems after vaccination.  .  She woke up today feeling achy and feverish, and measured her oral temp at 1000 as 101.4 at home.  She drank fluids, but took no meds -- repeat oral temp at 1200 was 99.0.  .  Other sxms include sore arm at vaccination site with min redness but no swelling.   .  She additionally reports nasal congestion and sore throat that began 1 day prior to vaccination, that she attributed to her seasonal allergies.  No meds for allergies.  No cough or SOB.  No headache or neuro sxms.  No GI sxms.  .  She was concerned about fever and went to drive-thru COVID testing at approx 1300... results due back in 24h.  She has no known COVID contacts.  .  She works in sterile processing at NMCSD with no direct patient contact usually; She is on night shift now.  -  Fever and achy symptoms, as above, in previously healthy hospital worker, with onset approx 18h after receipt of COVID-Pfizer vaccine, dose #1.  With questionable URI-like sxms one day prior to vaccination, COVID testing was very reasonable -- and results are pending now.  If COVID test negative, this most likely represents mild-moderate systemic reaction to vaccine.  Advised no work this evening, rest at home, increase clear fluids, and take Motrin 400mg q4-6h as needed for subjective fever or achiness -- use/precautions reviewed.  Will follow-up tomorrow with this team by phone.  If vaccine reaction, expect sxms to lessen rapidly and resolve over next 1-2 days.  Indications for urgent care -- including marked worsening of sxms or new sxms -- reviewed.  She also has number for 24/7 Immunization Support.  Will file VAERS, since work missed for sxms.  Will encourage enrollment in VSAFE as well.  Advised that, if mild-moderate systemic reaction determined most likely source of sxms, dose #2 of COVID-Pfizer vaccine will still generally be recommended.  Pt expresses understanding and appreciation of all issues.

                                                chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient. A 21-year old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number: EL0142, intramuscularly in the left deltoid on 06Jan2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 21-years-old) at 0.3 &#34;mg&#34; as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included birth control use and obesity. Concomitant medications included ongoing ethinylestradiol/norgestimate (SPRINTEC) tablet for birth control. The patient did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA) 27 mg and experienced lack of appetite and was still having sleepiness (insomnia she guessed) and therefore was dropped to 18 mg and still had side effects; as well as guanfacine. On 07Jan2021 at 21:00, the patient experienced chills. She thought it was just her mom&#39;s house being cold, but she had a little bit of a chill all day today (08Jan2021). She didn&#39;t have a fever. The last time she took her temperature it was 98.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which was normal for her. The caller stated she did have a slower metabolism when it came to medication. She didn&#39;t know 100% if she hadn&#39;t been exposed to COVID, as she worked in healthcare and worked last on Monday. The event, chills, did not prompt an emergency room or physician office visit. The caller was worried if this was a normal side effect of the vaccine or if she was getting sick with COVID. She would go through with the COVID test she had scheduled for &#34;tomorrow morning&#34; as she was still experiencing side effects. The chills stayed the same or were a little worse. The clinical outcome of chills was not resolved.

A 21-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot FJ1685, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (unable to confirm if given intramuscularly) on 05Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included soreness in arms (no matter what vaccines she gets). The patient had no known other allergies. Patient had family medical history of mother has asthma.  Concomitant medications included birth control (unspecified) as the only thing she takes and she did not feel it was relevant. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced arm soreness. Patient had flu shot every year because it is required. She will get soreness in arm and she thinks when she took different vaccines when she started work. She had to take a bunch of them. Soreness was in whatever arm she gets the shot in. Patient works on Covid unit as a recreation aide in a nursing home and received first vaccine on 05Jan2021 and on 06Jan2021 developed headache, and on 09Jan2021 had sore throat, coughing, and felt like a mild cold starting three days after vaccine (08Jan2021), and had been taking cold medicine.  She gets twice weekly for work, and she tested negative (COVID) on Friday (08Jan2021).  Patient asked if this was normal to be developing symptoms that late after the vaccine. She just wanted to know if what she was experiencing was normal because she was freaked out about it. She works on a COVID unit and wears a lot of PPE. She started to experience symptoms after 3-4 days after getting the vaccine. She wanted to know if it was normal to take that long to feel side effects or should she be worried about actually having COVID. There was no prescriber. She had it as a part of work. When it rolled out, they were a part of it and if you work on COVID unit, they said you should get it. She got the vaccine on Tuesday, 05Jan2021, and started feeling symptoms on Friday, 08Jan2021. She started getting worse on 09Jan2021 and 10Jan2021. Furthermore, patient then reported that the headache started 3 days after receiving the vaccine. It persisted for the first 3 days and then after she got other symptoms, it subsided. Headache in the morning when she first woke up and persisted throughout day. Since then she will wake up in the morning with a slight headache. Soreness in arm was when it was first administered (05Jan2021), that was normal and she usually gets soreness no matter what vaccines she gets. This lasted for 2 days and then went away. She did say that the flu vaccine and some other that she did not remember the name of were the ones she remembered getting sore from. She did not have a manufacturer, lot or expiration for any of them. The fourth day was when she had a sore throat and coughing, that started in the morning when she woke up around 10:00. She had it all day yesterday and it was pretty severe and then she started getting better later in the night. Today it was less, but still here. She did take something to try and make herself feel better, so it definitely helped. Loose stool improved and today (12Jan2021) was yet to be known. Loose stool started in the afternoon of 06Jan2021. No ER (emergency room) or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events sore throat, coughing, and felt like a mild cold. The patient had not recovered from the event headache. The patient recovered from loose stool and soreness in left arm in Jan2021. The outcome of the events sore throat, and coughing was recovering. The outcome of the event &#34;felt like a mild cold&#34; was unknown.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                5 mins post 1st dose vaccination patient began feeling nauseous, throat felt tight with mild pain when swallowing, tingling sensation from the chest down to her toes, facial flushing, and dizziness. She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins. Patient was monitored for over 45 mins. She was instructed to contact her PCP and her allergist to be cleared for her second vaccine dose. She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

Around 2:00 on 3/11/2021, patient felt a chill, her temperature was 100.4 F orally. Temperature further increased to 103 F around 13:00 on 3/12/2021.   What happened as a result of the adverse event? (doctor visit, ED or urgent care visit, hospitalization, life threatening illness, disability/permanent damage, death, none of these): none of these, took OTC apap last night and this morning and just took ibuprofen after the 103 F reading.  Spoke with patient&#39;s mother, who stated that the is feeling fine. The patient&#39;s temperature is currently 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and initially came back to normal at 02:00 today (3/13/21). The patient experienced elevated temperatures before that time (02:00), of note was at 22:00 on 3/12/21, at which time the patient had a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A later temperature after 22:00 on 3/12/21, and before 02:00 on 3/13/21, was recorded, which was 101 degrees Fahrenheit.   The patient&#39;s mother stated that the daughter may have COVID based upon speaking with her doctor, so she inquired if her daughter should be tested for the presence of antibodies against COVID-19. Patient&#39;s mother also inquired if there was a need for the second shot if it was seen that her daughter had antibodies against the virus.  Advised the mother that her questions would be looked into for answers, and that she would be called back with those answers.

She said she didn&#39;t feel well, and she didn&#39;t want lunch. Then she went and vomited. We took her temperature, and it was normal. We talked to her, made sure she was oriented. She then had a bout of diarrhea in the bathroom. It took about an hour for her color to completely come back and for her to feel better. She called Pfizer and spoke to them to make a report. They told her they have not had reports like this a few days after the vaccine was given. We were not sure if she should have the 2nd round or not.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Jan2021 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No family history relevant to adverse events. Patient has no concomitant medications. On 16Jan2021 09:20, 20 minutes after vaccination, the patient felt like she was going to pass out reported as vasovagal reaction, and experienced heart beat was high, fatigue, woozy/dizzy, hard to concentrate, feeling hot, and felt as though she was on the verge of a headache but never got one/she felt like the blood was rushing to her head. On 16Jan2021 10:00, 1 hour after vaccination, the patient experienced had to fall asleep. On the day she got the shot she sat for a full hour with the nurse to be monitored. Then she went home. The events lasted from 09:20 until 18:00 on that day. 13 days after vaccination on 29Jan2021, 12:00 and ongoing until reporting time, the symptoms recurred about the same when they started. The patient was wondering if this could be a side effect 2 weeks after getting the shot or if she should look elsewhere on what could be causing these events. She is supposed to get the second dose on Friday and was wondering about getting the second dose after her experience. Patient wanted to know it is safer for her to have the 2nd dose. No physician office visit and emergency room visit. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was recovered on 16Jan2021 18:00.

Could not taste because I could taste everything and the food ended up feeling like individual particles rather than a cohesive flavor. Some nasal congestion. Overall, felt like being sick, but worse. Exhaustion Soreness in left arm

                                                On March 7, 2021 my daughter experienced extreme tiredness.  I called 911 and paramedics said it may be the effects of vaccine.  I was concerned because this symptom came on 2 weeks later.  On 3/6/21, I took her to urgent care because I didn&#39;t feel comfortable with her extreme tiredness.  I was told the same thing. On 2/23/2021, the day that she was supposed to get the second vaccine, she awoke at 12 midnight and was having a full blown psychotic episode.  She was make loud noises, hitting the wall, etc.  I then took her to the emergency room. My major concern was because my daughter has Down syndrome, a seizure disorder and had heart surgery at three months old (atrio ventricular canal defect).

Her first seizure followed ~30 minutes after vaccination and she continued to have 6 additional seizures over the course of several hours, requiring admission to the hospital for several days as she recovered from her post-ictal state. She was febrile on admission to 100.5F. Mother of patient noted that she has never had this many seizures in a single day before.

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

She can hardly keep water or medicine down. No sign of a fever. Right now she is moaning in agony next to me. She seems sicker now than when we actually had Covid-19 in November 2020.

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

Developed slight cough at 9:00pm. I took Benadryl to help sleep through the night in case of any other side effects. Cough went away overnight, but my arm remained sore. I took Tylenol again on 3/26/2021 at 6:30am. At 7:00pm the same day, my left armpit began to feel sore which could not have been caused by anything other than vaccine as I haven?t been doing any physical activity. This worsened the next day, but I have not taken any Tylenol to alleviate it at this point.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

I was fine with these symptoms as I knew they were common side effects until my heart rate spiked from about 60 to the 160s and I began to have a throbbing headache. I could not get my heart rate to come down, I was calm and knew it was not anxiety so I went to the ER where they did blood tests, EKG, UA and gave me fluids. Everything came back normal but my heart rate continued to be elevated around 130s for a couple more hours, finally came down to about 100-110, HR is still slightly elevated and I still have a fever of 100.4 and migraine

I took my temperature around 1 pm today and had a fever of 100.8. Throughout today, my headache has gotten progressively worse. The pain is sharp at the base of my head and radiates down my spine. I cannot put my chin to my chest without excruciating pain. I have had migraines before and this does not feel the same. This headache is more localized in the back of my head and spine. I also have had COVID19 before at the beginning of July 2020 from which the only symptom I had was a loss of smell which returned 2 weeks after my positive COVID test.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. This case is serious, the other one is non-serious.   A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) intramuscular at left deltoid on 22Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines given at the same time. The patient received a flu shot back between 27th or 28th Nov2020 in her left deltoid. Caller reported getting the COVID vaccine on the 22Dec2020 and feeling fine before that. On the 28Dec2020 she started feeling chills and not feeling very good and that hasn&#39;t gone away. The patient went and got a rapid COVID test and it came back positive, not sure if it was because of the vaccine having antigens in it or she came into contact with it or if she just weakened immune system from the shot. The patient wanted to know if that was true. Then stated she and her mom got the COVID vaccine and her mom received it on the 23Dec. On the 29Dec her whole family started to get sick and experiencing the same things she experienced. The patient was not feeling well at the time of the call. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021001266 same reporter/ drug, different patient/event

                                                I woke up this morning with a very severe right dry eye. It was not responding to water or eye drops which is the first time that has ever happened to me. After several eye drops, I was able to drive to work where I was fine except for the eye pain until 10am. Then I started getting body aches, light-headedness and weakness. On the drive home (40 minutes), I developed a fever and the body aches worsened. If I do not consume liquid continuously, I get very light-headed and weak.

                                                A 22 y.o. female presenting with fever, tachycardia viral symptoms in the first 12 hours after receiving second dose of Covid vaccine.  Was feeling well prior to that.  Has soreness at her arm as well.  She has a history of POTS and did detect a rapid heart rate at home.  She has mild sinus tachycardia at this time reports a gradual improvement in symptoms.  Fever is improving, had not had any antipyretic prior to coming in.  I have low suspicion for acute infection and would favor immune response to the vaccine itself which has been reported in multiple persons receiving same vaccine.  She is not hypoxic, has clear breath sounds.  No thrombocytopenia on CBC.  IV was placed, IV fluids given.  Heart rate improved, blood pressure remained stable.  Patient feels well enough for discharge on reevaluation and declined need for analgesic or antipyretic here.

Upon follow-up on 1/25 patient reports she has recovered from her fainting episode but feels tired, achy, and generally unwell; these side effects are to be expected following the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

Tried steam and heating pad, little improvement  - Jan. 26th Took ProAir inhaler at 2pm before shift     - Little improvement     - Pain still in chest - Called my primary Dr. at 4:30     - Prescribed prednisone and Advair     - Thinks vaccine caused inflammatory response  - Took prednisone at 8pm - Took Advair around 11 - Took ProAir inhaler around midnight  - Heart racing (HR130) - SOB, pain when breathing  - Localized to sternum, on either side as if something was grabbing my lungs and squeezing  - Feel like lightning coursing thru my veins - Shaky  I ended the up in the ER Jan. 26th.  * I took prednisone at 8pm * I took Advair at 11pm * I was still having trouble breathing and my last hit of my ProAir had completely worn off * I took my ProAir around midnight  * Over the course of the next two hours I was SOB, tachy (HR 130s), hot and cold flashes, pain while breathing, couldn?t catch my breath * My friends took me to the ER around 2am * At the hospital they did a 12 Lead EKG, blood work, labs, 2 chest X-rays, and a COVID-test * They gave me 0.5 mg lorazepam IV  * All of my blood work and labs came back normal.  * X-rays came back clear * EKG came back fine * Negative COVID test * I took a nap after the lorazepam hit and woke up feeling much better * ER doc thinks my ProAir exacerbated some anxiety because my lungs were clear and no wheezing  * Discharged me with a script for lorazepam PRN x10 and instructions to follow up with my primary is back at home.  * Doc said I could continue the prednisone and Advair  * Woke up today and yesterday feeling better, still some pain when breathing and exhausted. Pain is mostly at top of my lungs, going across my chest. Deep breathing sometimes helps but there?s also pain upon inhalation.  * Took the next doses of Advair and my Dexedrine (ADHD meds). Nothing weird yet just drained.   They switched my Ventolin inhaler to ProAir, I have been taking it about five times a week so I can workout. When I was on Ventolin I didn?t have any of the side effects I have with ProAir.

                                                Patient is a registered nurse at facility.  She reported having slight itchy lips and scratchy throat after 1st dose.  Patient very much wanted full protection that 2nd dose offers in order to be safe and keep family members safe.  We discussed the possibility of an increased reaction, but she wanted to go ahead and felt the benefits outweighed the risk.  I considered the fact that she is a health care professional, was fully informed and that we were at a skilled nursing facility and were prepared in case she had any reaction.  About 10 minutes after vaccination she seemed to be coughing and felt like her throat was maybe swelling.  She seemed to be breathing ok, but I asked her to take a Benadryl, which she did.  Within 5-10 minutes after that she began shaking and seemed very pale.  She said her symptoms were getting worse.  I told her I was going to administer an epi-pen dose.  911 was called, I administered the epipen, we had heart rate monitor and pulse ox monitor on patient and she was stable, but scared.  EMT&#39;s arrived and transported patient to ER.  She was later released with Benadryl.

                                                About 5 mins after the shot I received on Sunday, I got a cooling effect in my chest and began to feel a bit off with an elevated HR of 132. I raised my hand to talk to a nurse and she said I was probably just nervous, got me a water, and said to continue to monitor symptoms. Then, after 15 minutes were up with no other symptoms I left the facility where I got the vaccine. The rest of the day I began to get a burning and cooling effect all around my sternum. It persisted through the day despite Tylenol 500 mg and worsened at night, keeping me up along with a slight fever and chills. The next morning I awoke with slightly lowered symptoms but the sternum pain would flare up on and off through the day and again was worse at night on Monday. So, I took a Benadryl and a 500 mg Tylenol and slept great. I woke up Tuesday feeling great with no fever and minimal chills and no sternal pain. I thought since I hit the 48 hour mark everything was going fine and I was recovering. I ran some errands and even went to the gym to do a mild workout. Then at about 6pm all the symptoms of the sternal pain flared up and was just as bad as Monday night. I took another 500mg Tylenol and 1 Benadryl again and they did not seem to work or help nearly as much as the night before. I woke up this morning with some pain in my sternum again and did not sleep much last night due to the pain as well. I have not taken any further medications at this time and I am also experiencing the worst fatigue I have so far today.

After 3 hours, I threw up, lost my ability to walk on my own, and briefly lost my vision (5 seconds). I drink socially about 1x per month, sometimes consuming many more drinks than I consumed on this particular night. Never before did I encounter these effects from alcohol when consuming 1-1.5 drinks per hour.   The next day I felt very tired, sluggish, and run down all day long.

                                                I got my vaccine at noon on saturday Feb. 6th. Within about 12 hours of my second covid vaccine, I started to become fatigued and had soreness in my arm. When I woke up the next morning (approx 20 hours post injection) I was drenched in sweat, fatigued, had a headache, body aches (back and neck), and a temperature of 100.9 (taken orally). The rest of the day I had hot/cold flashes. I would go from sweating to shivering every 10-20  minutes. I had a consistent fever of 100.3-100.7 until about 8pm when it read 96.5. I took Tylenol at 7am that day and ibuprofen at about 7pm. Hot/cold flashes continued through the night last night. I am still having cold/hot flashes (drenched in sweat then full body chills, but not shivering). I&#39;ve taken my temp multiple times today and it has consistently read at about 97.1 without fever reducing drugs. My body temp typically runs normal (98.6). I currently still feel fatigued, have a slight headache and some aching in my neck and back.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

                                                Developed a whole body rash 6 days after my first Pfizer vaccine. The rash was very large and covered about 80% of my body. The rash consisted of redness, small bruise spots and extreme itching. I self treated myself by taking several cool showers and took acetaminophen two times two capsules. On the second day, blotches are subsiding but I have fatigue and weariness in limbs. Skin is less red but has a sallow color and blotchy which is unusual.

                                                From the beginning, I had extremely enlarged lymph nodes and felt fatigued. Every day my lymph nodes grew until they were the size of golf balls. On Tuesday morning at 2:30 AM, I began to have a fever and developed a mild full body rash. This severely escalated and by Wednesday, I developed full body hives and uncontrollable fevers as high as 105. Since then, I have been anti-histamines and steroids, which made my rash worse but helped the fever and lymph nodes. My hives are painful, itchy, and getting worse.

It began to radiate to the left, and Wednesday I went to Urgent Care because I was scared. My EKG &amp; chest x-ray were clear. Today I feel even worse with migraines, chest pain (that radiates up my neck and around my back), and overall feeling gross and exhausted. My head is what?s bothering me the most along with my joint pain.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

                                                Shortly after being given the vaccine the person had an episode of near-syncope where she felt light-headed and was not feeling well.  She has had a history of this occurring in the past after an injection before (unknown if vaccination or other IM injection) and blood draws.  She did not have any loss of conscious, but she became pale and diaphoretic and felt like she could pass out if she would stand consistent with a vasovagal event.  She initially had an elevated pulse at 113 which came down to 65 and her blood pressure was initially 110/60 and then 98/62 on recheck.  Patient was placed supine on a cot and then her legs were elevated to help her symptoms.  She did have some improvement in her symptoms prior to transport to the ER via EMS at her request.

                                                I got the usual cold-like symptoms the next day. I took a nap and woke up and felt pretty much fine after that. After the 1st, I started getting waves of dizziness. I would lay on ground and I couldn&#39;t get up. After a couple of days, I could do stuff but would get random waves of dizziness and would have to sit down until it went away. My doctor told me to take Allegra and I just kind of lived with it. It didn&#39;t help with symptoms. It started affecting my work because I&#39;m a CNA and I couldn&#39;t be having dizzy spells at work. I went to ER - on January 10th. They sent me to Hasboro because they were to busy at ER. The nurse said I had Vertigo - and they discharged me with Meclizine while I was in ER and it didn&#39;t help. I called me doctor a couple of days after. She told me to combine the Allegro with the Meclizine and that didn&#39;t help with either. I called my doctor back and she said that there is nothing else I can do because my bloodwork came back normal.  I&#39;m not currently taking anything and I&#39;m still getting random dizzy spells. I have returned to work and so I just have to take breaks at work when it happens.  I got the second vaccine on the 19th of January.

This non-pregnant 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Feb2021 at 09:45 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression and anxiety, both from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no allergies to medication, food or other products, and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included duloxetine from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LARIN FE) from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ibuprofen from an unknown date for an unknown indication; and acetaminophen from an unknown date for an unknown indication. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported, it first started as a headache and extreme fatigue about two hours after the vaccine. She took two ibuprofen and felt better for a few hours, but the fatigue kept growing and then she started to get cold sweats and chills. The day after was the worse. She had fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain and fatigue, pain at the injection site, and congestion. She took acetaminophen through-out the day and couldn&#39;t eat much. The second day the fever and cold sweats went away but she still had intense nausea. It was the third day (as of 10Feb2021) and she felt better but still had fatigue and minor nausea. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. The clinical outcomes of headache, extreme fatigue, cold sweat, chills, fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain, congestion, couldn&#39;t eat much and pain at the injection site were reported as recovering. It was also reported that since vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                About five to ten minutes after I received my first shot, I started to feel like my throat was closing a little. I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Apr2021 at 09:10 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, asthma from an unspecified date (diagnosed at 4 years old and it is usually controlled with medications) and ongoing and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome from 2019 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccination and did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced allergic to flu shot preservative and the patient previously received Biaxin on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced allergy. On 17Apr2021 at 09:12 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock; on 17Apr2021 the patient experienced throat feels tight, ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that comes and goes and then it will be on her chest , face, neck and shoulders and migrates wherever; on 18Apr2021 the patient experienced ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat; on 20Apr2021 the patient experienced dark purple on face; on 24Apr2021 the patient experienced some trouble breathing and chest pain; on 25Apr2021 the patient experienced a lot of bone pain; on 26Apr2021 the patient experienced white blood cell counts are all elevated and on unspecified dates the patient experienced face and neck swells, tachycardia, feels like she is having an asthma attack, blotch, blood counts continue to become worse and asthma worse. The reporter called to report that her daughter received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 17Apr2021 and that her side effects started two minutes later (also reported as 4 minutes later). The patient experienced anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. She stated that her daughter continued to have anaphylactic reactions and had to go to the hospital every day since then. The clinical course was reported as follows: her daughter and her husband went to get the vaccine together on 17Apr2021. They went to a facility giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the reporter stated that her daughter was asked, and she did tell them, that she could not receive the flu vaccine that had the additives in it because she was allergic to it. The reporter stated that her daughter was not taking the flu shot for years. She stated that her daughter was allergic to Biaxin but could take Zithromax because of the different additives. They had no idea what the preservative was, but it was obviously in the flu shot so they stopped getting the flu shot until they stopped putting the preservative in the vaccine. The reporter stated that her daughter received the COVID-19 vaccine and within two minutes her daughter told her dad that she was having a hard time breathing. Her daughter walked over to the city EMS who were on site and told them that she was having a hard time breathing. They treated her and then took her to hospital via ambulance. She was treated at the hospital and they were hesitant to discharge her because they were worried about her bounce back. This was exactly what has happened. Every night since the vaccine she has had to take her daughter into the hospital. Every day was a nightmare of either EpiPen injections, Tagamet, Benadryl or prednisone and ended up in the ER every day, where they give her IV Benadryl and send her home. The caller stated that her daughter&#39;s symptoms start with ginormous welts and then an itching to the back of the throat. She had seen a ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that came and went and then it would be on her chest, face, neck and shoulders and migrated wherever. She saw dark purple on her daughter&#39;s face yesterday before she went to the ER. Her skin will blotch, and she will say that her throat feels tight like when she had a reaction to penicillin. She stated that her daughter used to get this when she they would give her penicillin; she would have that reaction every time she got penicillin and they finally said she was allergic to it. The caller states that after those symptoms started, she called EMS and they took her to a hospital. The caller stated she took her daughter to another hospital and they medicated her with IV Benadryl and fluids. Her primary care doctor told the emergency room staff to discharge the patient and that he would give her specific medications to go home with. He called in the medications, but they did not work. He gave her specific medication that did not work, half of her face was turning purple. The purple face was then replaced by an area approximately 1 inch wide on cheek between temple and the jaw. It was 1.5 inches long and was red and looked like a rash or welt. The patient would take an inhaler when she started to have breathing difficulties. That was when the reporter was like &#34;here she goes again&#34;. It felt like it almost made her asthma worse and had to treat that as well. There was a little oddity when they did blood work on her daughter and her white blood count was high and was probably her body reacting to the COVID-19 vaccine. So, she went back to the hospital. The nurses said there was nothing they could do for her, and she needed to find an allergist. The reporter stated that she was tired of the ER visits and wanted her daughter to get better. She stated that she doubled the dose of her daughter&#39;s Tagamet. She stated that the patient&#39;s face and neck swells and she would get tachycardia. The reporter stated that she would not take her daughter to the hospital anymore. The hospital did not think it could be related to the vaccine, but she had not done anything else. The reporter wanted to report this event because she did not think people were taking this seriously. She stated that no one believed it was related to the vaccine, so they were not getting help. She wanted to know if this was a side effect and what could she do about it. She also inquired on whether her daughter should get the second shot. She stated that her daughter would not get the second shot. She had heard that if you had any reaction to the vaccine, then you should not receive the second dose. Her daughter&#39;s doctors have told her to receive the second vaccine. The reporter also stated that she wondered if this was some mast cell activation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reporter also asked if Pizer made a preservative free vaccine. Upon follow-up received on 27Apr2021, the patient called to report that she was still experiencing side effects from the anaphylactic reaction and it had been 10 days since administration. She was told it would last about 4-10 days and then be gone, but it had continued, and it had been over 10 days. She had no new symptoms, other than a lot of bone pain. The bone pain made it feel like her bones were shattering. She went to the ER yesterday where they did blood work and said that all of her white blood cell counts were elevated. The anaphylaxis lasted from 17Apr2021 and subsided in that sense on 24Apr2021.  Since then she still had the chest pain, some trouble breathing, and felt like she was having an asthma attack. She had been back and forth to the ER several times since 17Apr2021. The ER kept ruling her symptoms as a reaction to the vaccine. She had been using epinephrine as needed. The patient stated that she was not planning on receiving the second dose due to her reaction. She wanted to know where she should go from here. She wanted to know if this would last forever and how much longer could her symptoms last. The clinical outcomes of the events ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat and a lot of bone pain were not recovered/not resolved; dark purple on face was recovered/resolved on 21Apr2021; outcomes of all other events were unknown.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird. All test were negative. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. Events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102 were serious with criteria of medically significant, while the other events were non-serious.

                                                Three hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feel extremely tired and had a headache. Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

On 01/08  ~5 PM I began to develop  a fever that reached a peak of 102.4 at 4am (01/09), despite taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Last fever recorded 01/09 ~9PM of 99.5 (while still taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours).  Additional symptoms have been severe nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, bilateral lower back pain with some mild bruising to the kidney region, difficulty breathing,  chest pressure, shortness of breath along with a cough upon exertion (developed ~6 PM 01/08), which is still present today (01/10 1:25 PM), and an erythematous rash that covers the anterior side of the right forearm, from wrist to elbow (first noticed on 01/10 ~11 AM).

Woke up at about 5 pm very tired, weak, with chills; painful arm. By the next day my arm was swollen and painful around the injection site and stayed that way for about 3 days. Chills primarily first 48 hours. Weakness, fatigue - sleeping a lot, feeling exhausted walking upstairs/short distances, things felt heavier than usual - lasted about 3-4 days

                                                Recieved vaccine at noon on 1/10/21 was awoken out of sleep from body aches at 1am on 1/11/21.  I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

                                                The first day 1/07/21 I started with a pain on my throat , my throat felt really sore however I was still able to eat . The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

I did not experience SOB, cough, vomiting, nausea, or diarrhea. These symptoms lasted about 20 hours, and were at first not responsive to extra strength Tylenol, but after many hours the fever broke. I was not allowed to return to work until I was fever free for 24 hours and tested negative for COVID-19 infection. I was swabbed at my place of employment, Hospital and my NP sample was run.  I tested negative on 1/13/21. I then returned to work on 1/14/21.

                                                Vaccines received in series on 12/11/20 and 1/11/21. Three days before due date for second COVID vaccine, started severely itching and experiencing hive-like rash all over body, especially to hands and head; mostly relieved by benadryl but wore off every 6 hours. Contacted PCP (listed in form) who suggested taking zyrtec and using a moisturizing lotion. This helped for the day of receiving the vaccine. Thinking it was something unrelated due to the time elapsed from the vaccine, despite no changes in consumption or products/environment encountered, I went ahead and got the second vaccine. Day 1 after vaccine, I experienced the usually reported side effects, including slightly elevated temp, chills, and body aches. Itching and hives continued but not as noticeable due to other side effects. The next morning, hives and itching were significantly worse; any time I scratched (or something touched my skin more than lightly), large, red welps would nearly immediately develop, and often had raised bumps within the irritations. To date, this is continued, slightly relieved by allergy medications, but not entirely and must be taken around the clock or severe symptoms will begin again.

                                                Around 9pm, I started getting the chills and some body aches. Body aches were worse in my hands, neck and lower back. By 10pm I felt extremely exhausted, continuing with body aches and chills. Around 12am I had a fever of 102.6 and extreme 10 out of 10 lower back pain. I have never felt more sick in my life. The back pain was so severe I thought I was having a kidney stone. I was ready to go to the hospital. The fever lasted until  about 4am when I took some ibuprofen. I felt tired and had mild body aches until 3pm the  following day.

Monitored over about 40minutes and in house rapid response team called when not feeling better. As it typical with her POTS, she felt tired, hands  cold, trouble speaking  and so was transferred to ER for further care and monitoring.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                So I received the vaccine on my left arm on January 20th and the next day I had swelling on my left arm and neck. It went away within an hour or so. However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

                                                I received the COVID19 vaccine on January 22, 2021. I started to have chest tightness and somewhat of a dry cough midday on Monday January 25, which continued until January 27. I started having congestion and runny nose on January 27, so I went and got tested for COVID on the 27. The test came back positive on January 28. On January 28 I had extreme congestion and head pressure, a bad burning sensation from my left sinus that went back to my left 2nd molar, and a runny nose. I had not gone anywhere the week prior due to studying for an exam besides to lab at school twice where everyone was socially distanced and was wearing a mask the whole time. The highest my temperature got was 99.4 with Tylenol on January 28. In addition to this, my husband got covid tested on January 28 to see if he had it, or had given covid to me and his test came back negative. We had not socially distanced and still had physical contact the entire time, and continued not to do so in our house. We have had full contact the entire time because he is working from home and most of my school is online, and he got tested again on January 30 and came back negative again. If somehow I got covid from school in a short amount of time with everyone wearing a mask, how would he not get covid from me after a full week of exposure unless I was not contagious, which makes me think I somehow got it from the vaccine. I have had adverse reactions to vaccines in the past, as I got the shingles when I was 4 as a direct result from the first chickenpox vaccine.

A 23-year-old female  patient reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number unknown), intramuscular at single dose into the left arm on 20Jan2021 at 08:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was unknown. Concomitant drug  was Sertraline and Mili tablets. Within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine the patient received the vaccine TDAP on 08Jan2021 in the right arm. On 20Jan2021 at 09:00 PM the patient experienced injection site pain, chills, headache, body aches, nausea, swollen lymph nodes, fatigue. These started about 12-14 hours after getting the vaccine and worsened over the next several hours. Most symptoms resolved, but she still had swollen, tender lymph nodes in the neck and armpits as well as some mild body aches and headache (at the 48 hour mark). No treatment was received. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                The shot went in my arm and I immediately started feeling itchy. Before the needle was out, I knew something was wrong but almost didn?t believe how fast it happened. My throat started itching and swelling shut. I was in full blown anaphylactic shock in less than 2 minutes. I got an EpiPen shot in the parking lot and was admitted into the hospital where I continued having various reactions. A week after the shot, I?m still breaking out in hives uncontrollably.

                                                About 1.5-2 hours post immunization the patient returned having developed a headache and a quarter sized welt that was lightly red, swollen and very tender to touch, just below her left collar bone about 4 inches from the injection site. The welt was outlined and observed and the patient was given 25mg of Benadryl. After about 20 minutes the swelling and tenderness had spread to an area approximately the diameter of a tennis ball. At this point she was refered to see a doctor at the Health Center. The nurse called to follow-up once the patient arrived as she had not seen this type of reaction after the vaccine. After discussion the physician was going to look at her. Reportedly the swelling had begun to retract and the patient apparently returned to work later that day, talking about her plans to receive the second dose.

                                                A few hours after  receiving my second dose of the COVID vaccine, I was extremely fatigued. I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

Last evening I was up all night with fairly severe symptoms, including a severe migraine unrelieved by pain medication, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and a low grade fever. I felt unsafe to return to work today and called out due to my fever.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

Uncertain about time of loss of consciousness. Other symptoms included pallor, fast heart rate, sweating, nausea and loss of bladder function.

Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I felt extremely lightheaded, eyes were blurry for 5-10 minutes, and extreme sweating all over my body. These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

Hasn?t gone down yet, but it?s about the size of an apple. Slight fever in the evenings. On night 11, bumpy rash on the neck and back were visible. I felt better after taking a Zyrtec and inhaler. Neck/back rash have gone away but the injection site is still inflamed. It?s a 3 inch circle on my left arm with the injection site at the center. I have no reason to believe it?s a bruise, I have not bumped that area of my left arm anytime within the past month. To the best of my knowledge, I haven?t taken anything that would trigger an allergy

I went to and urgent care where they gave me a 50 mg shot of Benadryl. AFter about 20 minutes the reaction was getting better so they released me to go home. They told me to continue taking the Benadryl every 4-6 hours for the next 2-3 days. I did as directed for through the night and the next day. Around 6:30 pm on 3/20 I started feeling very tired, shaky, and dazed. My about 9:00 that evening I began to feel swelling in  my throat/tongue. I then went to the emergency room and where they gave me another 50 mg shot of Benadryl and a 6 mg shot of Decadron. They monitored me for a couple hours and the swelling in my mouth had gone down and the rash that had also reappeared had gone down. They sent me home with a prescription for Prednisone 10mg 4 pills a day for 4 days and told me to continue the Benadryl. I took the Prednisone and Benadryl for all day 3/21 and was feeling better. When I woke up on 3/22, my chest and arms had a rash on them. I took a Benadryl around 7:30 and Prednisone around 8:30. I went to work and around 10:30 my face started getting red and swelling again. I contacted my dermatologist who did skin patch testing and got an appoint for 3/22 at 1:45. She extended the Prednisone out to 12 days and told me to switch to Zytrec during the day and I will follow up on three weeks.

Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

                                                I felt very fatigued starting around 6pm. Severe chills began around 9pm, followed by a fever. The fever went from 100.1 to 102.2 over the course of about an hour (11:30pm-12:30pm), at which time I took 400mg of ibuprofen. The fever was 102.1 thirty minutes after taking the ibuprofen. Along with the fever I experienced tachycardia, body and muscle aches, and moderate to severe deltoid pain at the injection site. I believe the fever broke around 3:00am. The fatigue and body aches lasted about 24 hours since they began, but the majority  of the rest of my symptoms were gone after the fever. The arm pain at injection site was noticeable and painful for about 72 hours before subsiding.

                                                Got the COVID vaccine(1st dose) on 01/12/2021. Had Benadryl with it due to previous allergic reactions. Later that night, I had nauseous. Slept for 10-12 hours. Woke up fine, had no issues or symptoms. Later on as the day progressed, around noon-1pm, I noticed I had started to get a headache and some dizziness. Daily headaches and vertigo are normal for me, currently seeing a neurologist for this, but I realized that this was getting worse from the daily headaches and vertigo that affects me. Took 2 Excedrin extra strength migraine relief to no relief.

Later that night, I had very strong rigors, chills, severe headache and felt feverish. I took some Tyenol and felt a little better. I woke up at 5 AM to go to work, and my body was so fatigued and tired I couldn&#39;t move. My hands were shaking badly, and my whole body hurt. My joints hurt, my muscles, ect. I called out of work, as I work in the Micro lab doing COVID-19 PCR testing, I couldn&#39;t pipet correctly if I was shaking. I do not have any pre-existing conditions, and I have no allergies. I have never experienced an adverse reaction to a vaccine.

I took Tylenol twice that day and felt a small amount of relief. I woke up the following day, 2 days after the vaccine, still feeling nauseous, had a headache, temperature 100.4, fatigue, and body aches. I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. 3 days following the vaccine I am still having nausea with vomiting, body aches, and fatigue, my temperature day 3 is 100.1. I had to call into work because of my symptoms and the screening tool used to get into work flagged me.

When I got home the body aches got worse and I started getting severe chills and could not stop shaking. That night was difficult to sleep because of the pain I was in. When I woke up the next day, 01/30/2021, I was dizzy, severe fatigue, had severe migraines, I could not breathe when standing up and moving around, my heart was racing, and it felt like I had a sun burn all over my body. I called the nursing coordinator for that day and asked what to do and she said to go to the ER. When I arrived at the ER, they said I had 100 degree temp., I was tacky. They gave me medicine for the pain and the doctor said I was having a adverse reaction to the vaccine but by the next day I would feel better. I went home and slept after the ER all day and night and by Sunday 01/31/2021, I was feeling better after excedrine and advil

                                                I felt a little fatigued all day after the shot, but nothing more. As soon as 10pm (02/01/2021) came around I had a pounding headache. The most intense headache of my life. I also got an intense stomachache and it felt like I had an ulcer. That progressed to a low grade fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The myalgia and arthralgia were so intense that moving to stretch my legs was incredibly painful. I was also very nauseous. The intensity of the arthralgia and myalgia subsided around 8am on 02/01/2021. All my other symptoms continued until around 11am on 2/2/2021. I still have a headache and some muscle pain, but they are manageable.

Over 5 hours I got  feeling back in left arm and left ER at 10:30p. CT was done to rule out stroke or other injury.

Later that day lumbar puncture done to rule out guillain barre syndrome. Numbness is not as severe now 2/3 and each day since 1/28 it gets increasingly less

                                                I received the first shot on a Tuesday and developed side effects starting the following Sunday. I woke up with a sore throat and fatigue and body aches and headache. I continued to have the same symptoms without relief from tylenol and Claritin around the clock for the next two days. When the symptoms were not relieved, that week following Thursday (12/30/2020)  from the shot, I got rapid Covid tested, flu, and strep tested. All were negative and send off covid was negative as well. On Friday, 12/31/2020, all my symptoms had resolved and I felt 100% better.

                                                I had nerve pain 8 on pain scale on 1/7, mostly centered on my back along my spine but when it was at its worst it was anywhere my skin was in contact with anything. First started feeling like my back itched at around 6:30pm. At 8:30pm, I started feeling exhausted and feverish. I took my temperature, it was 100.6 F, I took acetaminophen (2, 650mg tablets).  My symptoms did not get better and I started having chills and pain like needles stabbing me anywhere my clothes were touching me. I went to bed at around 11pm and tried to sleep unsuccessfully until 3am, tossing and turning in pain anywhere my skin was being touched, before trying ibuprofen (600mg, the dose I take for my migraines) which seemed to help and I finally fell asleep.  Next morning woke up feverish, exhausted, and in pain again. Once again ibuprofen helped and I continued taking it every 8 hours for the next day until my symptoms were no longer coming back when the dose was wearing off. Last ibuprofen was probably 10pm on 1/8.

                                                I had several adverse side effects from the vaccine (which I was expecting given it was my second dose). I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

                                                I started to get a headache then became more fatigued throughout the evening. I went to bed around 9 pm and had some chills and mild body aches so I took some Tylenol. I woke up around 12pm with sore muscles and cramps/aches in my back, hips, legs, and neck. I also had a mild fever of 100.7 and was nauseous. I took some Zofran for nausea. I had chills and was flushed and sweating. That next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was very fatigued, had little to no appetite, and had a pounding headache. I slept the entire day 1/25. The following day 1/26 I felt better but still groggy, I slept the majority of the day before heading off to work.

A 24-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 11:30 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema and known allergies: NSAIDs, &#34;no gas,&#34; eggs, gluten, dairy. Concomitant medications in two weeks included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), magnesium, and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Dec2020. She did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient reported &#34;I had my second injection at 11:30 on 18Jan2021. By 20:00, I was feeling fatigued and at 23:00, I got the chills and a fever and severe body aches radiating from the left side of my body. These lasted until around 23:00 on 19Jan2021 with a maximum temperature of 100.8. When I woke up on 20Jan2021, I felt fine, no fever, very mild body aches. Around 16:00, I began to feel fatigued again, and at 20:00 I felt I was coming down with a head cold (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, sore throat). At 23:00, I started violently vomiting and I vomited 10-12 times over the next 8 hours. I also spiked a fever of 102.6. I was prescribed ondansetron (ZOFRAN) on 21Jan2021, which kept the vomiting at bay and on 22Jan2021, I had a negative saliva test for COVID. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of feeling fatigued, severe body aches was not recovered; of chills, fever, head cold, and vomiting was recovered.

                                                sore; tired; getting this stabbing shock pain on the left side of my head; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A 24-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3249) via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 07:45 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at workplace clinic. No other vaccine was given within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient age at vaccination was 24 years. The patient has no known allergies. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported first days she was just sore, tired then by the 3rd day began getting this stabbing shock pain on the left side of her head that last about 3-5 seconds each time through out the whole day.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247), intramuscular in left arm on 22Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included generalised anxiety and allergies: Sulfa sensitive. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Jan2021, 45-60 minutes after vaccination, patient experienced hallucination, severe confusion, dizziness/light headedness, disorientation, fatigue, tachycardia, anxiety, full body weakness, then on 22Jan2021, 8 hours after, patient had full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, anxiety, tachycardia, 16 hours after, experienced  confusion, full body muscle aches, headache, chills, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 48 hours after, had confusion, full body muscle aches (TYLENOL helped), headache, fatigue, confusion, hallucination, tachycardia, anxiety, then 1 week after vaccination, patient was experiencing confusion, anxiety, and hallucinations throughout the entire week. Patient was unsure if she ever had a fever, as she did not check her temperature. The events were reported as non-serious. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID saliva test: negative on 27Jan2021 and negative on 10Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of full body muscle aches. No treatment was received for the other adverse events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event hallucination cannot be completely excluded given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                Anaphylaxis - Throat swelled almost completely closed, wheezing, lightheadedness (nearly passed out), throat/neck and injection site were very itchy and swollen, face/eyes swelled up, turned very pale all over, heart palpitations, etc. The next day - severe, horribly painful burning sensation all throughout my body.  Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I suspect fever was between 102 and 103 between 1:45 am and 4 am, however, as I did not feel well enough to find thermometer to take temperature until later on once fever had broken. Had 3 cycles of sweating and shivering between 1:45 am and 4 am. Lingering headache and body aches until 3 pm, fatigue and sore neck on side of vaccination (left) lasting rest of 3/12.

                                                Left deltoid pain began at about 2:30 pm, approximately 3 hours after vaccine was administered in that arm. Pain progressed throughout the next few hours but was moderate. Around 11:30 pm the pain became more severe, to the point where any deltoid movement caused extreme pain. I used an ice pack to try to alleviate the pain but it only provided mild relief. When changing my shirt around this time I touched the area lightly and saw it was slightly swollen with fluid around the site of vaccination. Continued using ice because I had not eaten recently and did not want to take ibuprofen on an empty stomach and cause heartburn. I was unable to sleep on my left side and woke up around 4:30 am in severe pain, put ice on it again and fell back asleep. I had a low grade fever of about 99.4 F at this time and some chills. On 3/16 I woke up around 9:30 am and pain was still fairly moderate-severe and swelling was present but less than the night before. Around 10:00 am I ate breakfast and took ibuprofen, and the pain and swelling have been more moderate since.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

After receiving the medications, symptoms subsided, and she was discharged home.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (reported as COVID 19 vaccine), intramuscular on 27Dec2020 12:00PM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccine location was left arm and it was the first dose. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included influenza vaccine (FLU) on 16Dec2020 at right arm. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced fever up to 120F, bodyaches, headache, dulled taste and smell, pain at the injection site on 27Dec2020. Patient didn&#39;t receive treatment for the adverse events. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was not recovered. The events were reported as non-serious.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [BNT162B2] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the event hyperpyrexia cannot be excluded based on compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Immediately after vaccine I had a bad headache which was cleared up with Ibuprofen. Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

                                                Around Midnight, the night following the second COVID-19 vaccine I started to become ill with feverish chills and nausea and puking. The nausea and puking went away a couple of hours after it started, so it could have been related to dinner. But the feverish chills continued well into the following day, Sunday 1/10. Sunday morning I woke up still  feverish with a temp of 99.7, and also achy with a slight sore throat. I drank plenty of fluids and napped during the day of 1/10 to break the fever, followed with day-quil and ny-quil at night. On Monday, 1/11 I woke up feeling much improved and no longer felt ill.

                                                No symptoms after first vaccine besides soreness to the injection site. After second vaccine, only symptom was soreness in the injection site for approximately the first 20 hours. Shortly after that I started experiencing chills and fatigue. Afebrile at 98.2F. Took an OTC Ibuprofen tablet and symptoms subsided. That same night fatigue and chills returned as well as I started experiencing a headache. By the morning headache subsided after a OTC Tylenol tablet but fatigue remained.

On 1/1 the itching started spreading throughout my body. I have continuously been itching since 12/31. The itching is all over my scalp, arms, hands, back, and legs. I have recently developed a pain/pressure in the back of my head, that feels like I have smacked it against a wall. I have also recently developed pain in my chest. I have seen my PCP, dermatologist, and ED drs and no one can find a route cause for my reaction.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Woke up at 5am with body aches and headache. Sat on the toilet but felt dizzy, had ringing in my ears, and felt woosy. Laid  back on bed and raised feet above my head. Took my temperature, it was 99.3F, which is a little high for me.  Ringing stopped after I laid down.

                                                Intermittent fevers and headaches/head pressure that have continued for 6 days post vaccination.   Side effects of muscle aches/chills subsided after 48 hours. Fever was less than 100F after 48 hours, so I returned to work per protocol. Was taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen.    3rd day: afebrile but headache remained. Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen to help manage.   4th day: intermittent fevers throughout day (no higher than 100.3F). headache continues.   5th day: afebrile in the morning, but as day progressed headache began to get worse and I eventually spiked a low grade fever as high as 101.5F that afternoon. I was excused from work per protocol and receiving care/evaluation from occupational heath and infectious disease for return to work purposes. Still taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen which were helping the fevers stay between 99F but not helping the headaches.   6th day: Taking Tylenol and Ibuprofen around the clock. Fevers have ranged from 98.9-100.8F so far. Headache still remains.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

She held her hand to calm down. gave her the vaccination and 5 mins later the patient said she has a headache, was upset, and started crying. She covered her eyes with her hands and started to shake. She also went to her bed and was rolling in it. The facility called 911 and they came within 5 mins. They did confirm that the patient wasn&#39;t having a seizure. Patient was calmed down but still went with the paramedics to be checked out. When I followed up with the facility, they said it was an anxiety event and the patient is back at the facility doing well. Let me know if you have any additional questions.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

                                                Friday- headache 2 hours after injection. Right Eye twitch Saturday- body aches, headache turned into a migraine on the entire right side of my head. I could not lift my right arm, I was exhausted doing everyday things.  Sunday- migraine wouldn?t go away. I got body chills but it wasn?t until later at night. And my body aches became moderate.  Monday- my migraine went down to a headache but my body aches wouldn?t go away. I did not take any pills. Throughout the day. I was tired. It was hard moving around. I was kind of sluggish but not as much as Tuesday. Tuesday- severe body aches. Both my arms hurt but I thought it was just due to laying in bed after getting home from work at 2:30 on Monday. Severe pain in my shoulders and middle of my back. I did some stretches thinking maybe my body was just sore from laying down. Went to bed at 12 because I couldn?t keep warm and my back was killing me.  Wednesday- horrible ache though out my back I got up to move but it hurt so much. I?m walking so slow. I need to rest on the walls because it hurts so much to move. My headache is still there. I took midol at 1:30pm;  did not do much. I?ve been trying to move about and stretch but my body does not allow me. Even typing hurts I cannot keep a good grip on things. My arms, entire left side of my back and many thighs  are in pain

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

                                                I received my 1st Covid shot on 12/21/20 and was diagnosed with Covid on 12/28/20. The day prior to testing positive I had been notified that I had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive. I did not have any symptoms when I tested positive on 12/28/20 except for a headache later that night. The next day I felt fatigued and had nasal congestion. On 12/30/20, i noticed that I had lost my sense of smell and my sense of taste was altered. I also felt mild chest tightness however my o2 sats remained above 95%. The congestion and fatigue only lasted for two days and my sense of smell and taste had come back by 1/1/21. The chest tightness has persisted even now after testing negative but has diminished over time and occurs less frequently.

                                                ED COURSE &amp; MEDICAL DECISION MAKING Patient  is a 25-year-old female who presents as a first responder to the emergency department today.  On my initial evaluation she is awake, alert, and in no acute distress, she does appear drowsy.  She is fully oriented and able to answer questions.  She has a normal neurologic exam.  Her labs show negative pregnancy, mild anemia, no leukocytosis, unremarkable CMP, normal CK.  A CT scan of her head shows no acute abnormalities.  The evaluation she appeared back to baseline.  On chart review it appears that she has previously been diagnosed with psychogenic nonepileptiform seizure and so no medication been previously recommended by her neurologist.  It is possible that her Covid vaccine triggered a recurrence of these versus this episode represents a true seizure.  Therefore I did recommend against driving, working at heights, swimming alone, and recommended things to help avoid seizures.  I recommended she follow-up with her primary care doctor as well as her neurologist.  I do not think she requires any medication today.  She is ambulating with a stable gait in the emergency department.  She will be discharged home, she was provided with reasons return to the emergency department.

A 25-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number=EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration at site of right arm on 20Jan2021 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included vitamin D3 and iron (SLOW RELEASE IRON) and daily multivitamin. Within minutes of receiving the dose on 20Jan2021 at 09:45 AM, dizziness, increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, flushed, weakness, and shakiness. About an hour after receiving the dose on 20Jan2021, lethargy, chilled, in particular hands were very cold, pale color, mental fog, and slurred speech. The patient did not receive any treatment from events. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported temporary mental fog/mental impairment was likely related to first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At 7:00am the morning after receiving my second dose of the vaccine, I arose from bed and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

Also, she developed gum swelling, purple spots on the gums, sores in the mouth, and fever blisters on the lips. Symptoms worsened and patient went to the facility to get a COVID test, which was negative. Over the weekend, patient developed swollen lymph nodes/neck and also noticed a lump in the left breast (same side as vaccination). Patient was nursing 11 month old and supply diminished (never returned). Went to stat care and was diagnosed with strep throat over the weekend. About 2 weeks post-vaccinations symptoms resolved and lump in breast no longer present.

                                                I made sure to hydrate and eat well the day of the vaccine. I have had no allergic reactions to any medications/ injections in the past and I was not worried about this one. I didn&#39;t take any meds beforehand besides my normal morning modafinil. I have no fear of needles.  I received the vaccine in the auditorium about 1:25pm. The RN did a fantastic job, went through all of the information, no pain at all with the injection. As I was sitting in my chair for monitoring, a few minutes in I began to feel very uncomfortable. I felt clammy/sweaty and kept shifting my weight in my seat. I didn&#39;t want to make a big deal of it at first because I worried it was all in my head. But I became more and more uncomfortable. I laid my head down on the little desk, no help. I closed my eyes, no help. About 10 minutes or so in I decided to ask if they had water available. I slowly got up and walked to the back of the room. I couldn&#39;t even get the question out of my mouth before the nurse told me to sit down. Apparently I was white as a ghost. They got a wheelchair and wheeled me to the space behind the auditorium. By then I was starting to feel like my throat was closing and I saw spots in my peripheral vision. It was kind of a blur from there. I tried to take deep breaths. I drank a few sips of water and poured some on a paper towel to wet my forehead (and spilled all over my lap because I was a little disoriented at this point). My BP was 60s/40s and then 60s/30s. A rapid response was called. They moved me to a cart flat on my back with my legs elevated. My fingers and toes were starting to go numb and my lips were apparently blue/ white. After laying for a few minutes in Trendelenburg my BP began to resolve and my breathing started to ease a bit. No further intervention was done by the rapid team. I was taken by the Rapid RN to the ED for monitoring. They eventually pushed the cart into a room and took some vitals and an EKG. They had me stand and move to a wheelchair. I felt horrible but improved from before. They had me sit in a wheelchair in the lobby for a few hours before taking me back and placing an IV and drawing labs (I believe it was 3 hours from the initial reaction). I gave a urine sample. They then put me in a wheelchair and wheeled me back into the lobby for some more time. Then, they wheeled me back to a room where they gave some lactated ringers and a PA and MD saw me. By then my BP and breathing was completely resolved. The MD said he wasn&#39;t fully convinced it was just a vasovagal episode because I haven&#39;t had issues with vaccines in the past and I was well hydrated and my HR was normal. It partly fit the picture for an allergic reaction/ severe immune response d/t the feeling of throat closing, the BP drop, and the elevated WBCs. They advised that I list the vaccine as an allergy and do not get the second dose, especially since I had COVID back in September.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

It?s turned into a more productive cough as time went on. No other symptoms. Went to the doctor and they tested for covid (negative), pneumonia (negative), so they diagnosed me with bronchitis.

                                                I had a moment yesterday evening where I almost passed out (tunnel vision and my arms and legs went numb) followed by an intense urge to vomit. I instantly broke out in cold sweats and completely soaked through my shirt in about a minute. The intense sensations passed, but happened again at around 10pm as well. I?ve just woken  up for the day today, and so far I feel okay but I?m a little weak and extremely tired.

                                                About 30 seconds after the injection I felt a strange sharp pain right under where the injection site was. I was advised to sit near the nurses station for 30 minutes instead of 15 due to my medical history. One of the nurses came by to check on me and as we were chatting my entire left shoulder and up my neck suddenly got red and rashy. I looked down and both of my arms were rashy as well. I began to experience itching everywhere. The nurse gave me 50 mg of benedryl and monitored me for about 40 minutes. The rash went down and they had my husband come pick me up. I called my pcp and advised them or the situation. She asked to keep her informed and if anything got worse to administer the Epi-Pen and go to the ER. Once home I slept for about 5 1/2 hours and then woke up in the afternoon. I had a minor headache and my arm had started to swell, but the rash was completely gone. As of today my arm is still red and swollen under the injection site, and itches quite a lot.

Severe diarrhea began the day after vaccination (3/21/21) at approx. 10pm with symptoms of bloating, heartburn, cramps, gas and soft stool that progressed to explosive watery diarrhea lasting until 11:30pm. On 3/22/21, I experienced a feeling of an unsettled stomach with some mild nausea, decreased appetite, and overall feeling of fatigue throughout the day with mild body aches, which was treated with 1 dose of Advil.

The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

                                                fatigue; Throat tightness; sore throat; Rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 25-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 06Mar2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6025) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Penicillin. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), took the week prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced rash (Amoxicillin tablets. Had allergic reaction when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime).   The patient experienced sore throat, throat tightness and rash, all on 06Mar2021 14:30. Clinical course: After receiving COVID 19 Vaccine, within one to two minutes of vaccine very strong sore throat and tightening of the throat. Was taken to emergency room by the ambulance that was at the testing center. At that time the ambulance at testing center recommended taking two Benadryl&#39;s, which started to work and sore throat and tightness completely went away about 15 minutes after that and then started to come back at time of riding in ambulance to the ER. While being written up and vitals checked, the rash (blotchy) developed to which she was given a Solumedrol steroid shot to fix the rash which amazingly cleared up rash and it ended up back to white. Had amazing clear photos of rash and it being red and sloshes starting to appear. After caller left ER and went home and had couple of follow up prescriptions of Pepcid and Atarax to help combat rash for two days. Now she was taking Allegra still for adverse events. Reporter mentioned sore throat was on and off but it had improved and still had a little bit of a rash. Caller had a little bit of tightness and it had improved if she exerted herself a lot the tightness got worse she wsn&#39;t referring to a big exertion but provided example like if she is going to the grocery store. The rash was severely reduced but was apparent. Caller also mentioned she had pretty severe fatigue after receiving vaccine unsure if this was because of the vaccine or an allergic reaction to some medication in her. She missed work on Monday and part time on Tuesday due to having to take breaks and naps during the day. Caller went into work but she did not feel up to working a full day in the office and was working remotely from home right now. The patient had allergic reaction to amoxicillin tablets when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime. Caller stated she knew how important it is to report not sure if there is an association between Amoxicillin and COVID ingredients. May have another allergy that was contributing but Amoxicillin was only other known allergy. Caller was asking for the next steps since she still has not fully recovered her throat, she is still feeling sore and tighter than normal and her skin was still redder than normal. When she had the rash it was red blotchy and warm to the touch it was no longer warm to the touch. Outcome of the events sore throat, throat tightness and rash was recovering, of event fatigue was unknown.

                                                I began having hives on my chest late Thursday night on the 18th, I took Benadryl to try and ease the hives. I continued to have hives spread across my chest, both arms, stomach, and the back of my knees from the 18-22, I suddenly lost my voice on the 21st when I woke up in the morning. I went to a park view clinic in my town on the 22nd and received treatment for my hives. As of the 24th I am taking medications prescribed to me and my hives are slowly going away and my voice is coming back. I have also experienced nasal drainage and a cough from the 19 and onward.

                                                I have been experiencing high blood pressure between about 140/90 and 130/85 with headaches and tinnitus. Blood pressure remains high throughout the day and was first noticed on 03/20/2021. I first took my blood pressure after noticing a mild headache that was not alleviated with hydration or OTC pain medication. Headaches have returned intermittently since 03/20/2021 but now only lasts 1-2 hours. Tinnitus was noticed several weeks ago (specific date is unknown) and is a mild and quiet but constant high frequency ringing. Unsure if any of these are related but I have never had tinnitus and my blood pressure is not this high nor do I have headaches often or back-to-back.

It started in her scalp, moved to her face, and then onto her throat. She was at work at this time. I advised her to take a 25 mg Benadryl (which may cause drowsiness). Based on her size (145 lbs) employee did not recommend she take a 50 mg Benadryl. Patient did not know if she had a fever or not. She reported NO fever at that time. Employee called her back at 6:30 PM to check on her. She said she had to leave work around 2 pm; she was feeling bad, achey. She said she took some ibuprofen as she was feeling achey and feverish. she didn&#39;t feel the need to go to the doctor or urgent care at this time.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

After my second dose my arm initially didn?t hurt but started to hurt hours later. I had cough and sore throat but the worse thing was I woke up with super puffy red eyes with green discharge coming out. I was fine until I got the Pfizer vaccine. The morning after I felt terrible. I called my doctor to see what he can do or prescribe for my eyes.

                                                Within 1 or 2 hours, I was getting hives on my arms and my neck. My throat was getting irritated and swollen a little bit. I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

                                                My daughter experienced immediate nerve pain at the site, L deltoid; followed by radiation to her fingers.  Then, she complained of extreme muscle pains, all over; itching and shortness of breath with formation of mucus in her chest.  She has interstitial lung disease and is well aware of what mucus-filling in her chest (lungs) feels like.  She also had headache and coughing and this necessitated using Benadryl 50mg, her Xopenex rescue inhaler at the site; followed by contacting of her pulmonologist for future treatment and instructions.
