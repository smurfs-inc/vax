                                                Approximately 2 days after receiving her vaccine, she began to develop swelling and tender spots on both legs, mostly around the knees. These spots continued to grow in size, swelling and got more red in color. She developed more around the ankles. Edema of both legs worsened. approximately 20 days after receiving the vaccination she developed a similar spot over the right thumb. She also complained of scratchy throat, especially when lying down at night although she is noted to have chronic allergies. On March 25, she was re-evaluated. Given that her symptoms were worsening, and lab tests were abnormal she was treated with prednisone.

A 90-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left arm, on 18Feb2021 at 10:50 AM, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic or chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including type 2 diabetes diagnosed years ago), and obesity. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Jan2021 at 90 years of age for COVID-19 immunization. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. About a week ago (Mar2021), the patient started experiencing delusions and hallucinations. The patient was currently hospitalized. These came on quickly, no definitive diagnosis. Over the last 2 months (2021), the patient slowly started slurring speech to the point where it was very slurred. In 2021, they took her to the emergency room (ER) and they did a battery of test including computerized tomography (CT) scan, blood test, urine, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. They were thinking maybe she might have had a small stroke but did not find anything. On Sunday (14Mar2021; within the last 2 weeks), the patient also had brain fog, and a little confusion, but was still there. The patient had no cognitive issues of any sort. On Tuesday (16Mar2021), the patient called and said there were some men at her house. The patient had the police go over and they said there was no one there and she started to say other things that did not make sense. On Wednesday (17Mar2021) at 03:00, the patient&#39;s granddaughter got a call from EMS that the patient reported someone broke into her home, stole her TV, and raped her. This was not true. By Wednesday (17Mar2021), the patient was in full blown psychosis with hallucinations, and delusions. The patient was hospitalized on Wednesday (17Mar2021) and the delusions, psychosis and hallucinations began between Sunday to Wednesday (Mar2021). The patient&#39;s granddaughter believes it all occurred after the vaccine. It was around the same time frame. The patient&#39;s granddaughter would notice a word here and there where the patient was slurring. The patient&#39;s granddaughter did not know if the patient was being lazy or tired and it gradually progressed. The patient&#39;s current state is in a very bad spot - cognitively, she is very bad (started on an unspecified date). The patient now has aphasia and extreme lethargy from 18Mar2021, and dysphagia from 22Mar2021.  This has all progressed since she has been in the hospital. The psychosis came out of nowhere. The patient was on a whole laundry list of medications and does not know if they were relevant to this. The patient had just recently started experiencing some extreme changes to herself to the point where she is hospitalized. The medical team is not finding anything wrong with the patient medically. The patient has developed some psychosis and there is nothing else that has happened that would have caused it. The patient had both doses of her COVID-19 vaccine. The patient&#39;s granddaughter was trying to research it to see if has been reported by anyone else. The patient&#39;s granddaughter considered the events as non-serious. The patient had not recovered from the events.

Anticoagulation was reversed (on warfarin at home for history of PE). Platelet count  responded to steroids and TPO-agonists per typical ITP treatment. Incidentally, the patient was found to have H. pylori stool antigen &#43; and commenced with quadruple therapy for this. Platelet counts continue to improve slowly w/ treatment.

                                                She got her 2nd vaccine, and almost immediately into her shoulder had pain in her shoulder blade and into her neck and had a lymph node on the right side of her chin/upper neck, then she has another one that is smaller and back further, and possibly a third one that is almost to the right side of her neck, tiny in nature.  None on the left side at all.  She felt that they would eventually go away and didn&#39;t do anything about it.  She went to see her Dr., and he did a neck scan on 4/7/21, and reported that it was not cancer and told her to watch it, but if they were there in 4 months that they would have to be removed, they are still there.    They have not changed in size.  She has not gotten any more either.  She definitely can feel the two and the third one is there but tiny.   Her arm is still very sore at the site of the shot at the muscle.  Almost daily at the site it gets very very sore and she gets chills and has to lie down due to exhaustion that lasts about 40 minutes and has to go lay down and then she gets back up once the chills pass.   She was having it every day at noon almost every day, and still continues pretty much on a daily basis, but the arm is still very sore.

                                                kidneys weren&#39;t acting/kidney issues; not having the feeling to urinate; Light-headed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (reported for herself). A 91-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248; expiration date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure and blood thinner. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner. The patient is asking if there were any reports of adverse events with kidneys and the vaccine. She received the 1st shot last Thursday (07Jan2021) and told that yesterday (10Jan2021), she had an episode where kidneys weren&#39;t acting. She also mentioned that she is on a blood thinner, ELIQUIS. She is due to receive the 2nd shot on 28Jan2021. She said that she wouldn&#39;t want to receive the 2nd dose if this was related to her adverse reaction. The issue with the kidney started after on 10Jan2021, yesterday she was really having problems, she went to church then came home by that time she would have to go to the bathroom, but she did not go, she ended up cooking dinner which was 3 hours later, she was noticing that she was not urinating. She drank some Gatorade and that made it little better, she is wondering if it&#39;s a side effect. On 10Jan2021, when she noticed the kidney issues, she did not know for certain if it started before that, she didn&#39;t pay attention. Also, yesterday (10Jan2021), she got sick in which she had to grab the counter, she felt bad, she wasn&#39;t dizzy, but felt light-headed. The symptom of not having the feeling to urinate had improved a little today but she is concerned and wanted to know if this was a side effect. Her being light-headed only occurred on 10Jan2021, it was a onetime occurrence yesterday. However, she was also just sitting around, laying around, after that yesterday.

This went on  for 4 days (until 1/31/2021).  She called a nurse at her facility morning of 1/31/2021, who told her it was most likely a side effect from the vaccine.   My mom did not feel reassured and called the front desk at her facility.   Eventually 911 was called, the paramedics came afternoon of 1/31/2021 and they told her her blood pressure was not quite right, and if she wanted to go to the hospital.  She said no.   She was less upset though.   She still didn&#39;t feel &#34;normal&#34; until 2/2/2021.  She is prone to panic and PTSD if things don&#39;t feel right.

Blood pressure, pulse and respiration were absolutely normal. But she was unable to speak for the rest of the day, she would open her mouth but could not get any words out. She also was extremely fatigued and slept most of the day, had no grip in her hands and was very stiff when she was able to get up. Had a slight fever, which went down after taking 1/4 of a Tylenol.  No pain in the arm at the injection site and also no redness or swelling.  So the know side effects of fatigue and muscle/joint pain hit her very hard.   She is much better today, 24 hours after experiencing the side effects.

A 91-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included some dementia. (ongoing). No relevant concomitant medications were provided. She said her mother had no side effects at the time she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her mother&#39;s arm didn&#39;t even hurt. She said her mother (who lives with her) woke up this morning (25Jan2021) around 4:30AM to go to bathroom, and then went back to bed. Caller stated she, herself, had left her house around 7:00AM this morning to go shopping, and when she got back from shopping 25 minutes later, her husband said her mother was in pain, left side of her head is hurting and he gave her mother a couple of paracetamol (TYLENOL). She said her mother told her the whole left side of her head hurts from her temple to her chin. Her mother was talking fine, and her mother was able to lift both her arms up, so she didn&#39;t think her mother had a stroke. She said for the past 20 minutes her mother has been laying back down and seemed to be doing better. The reporter stated that her mother could be having a migraine. She asked if anyone has previously reported to Pfizer developing a headache 4 days after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

This 91-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included high blood pressure, kidney cancer, cancer in her bladder 20 years ago and coughing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D), ascorbic acid (VIT C), losartan potassium for blood pressure, metoprolol succinate for blood pressure, amlodipine for blood pressure, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81).

Patient always had pain at the bottom of her foot but it was getting worse after she received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Patient noticed the liquid going thru arm to chest and in straight line to her leg, like a science fiction movie with an injection of some kind. The doctor thought the vaccine might have an impact on the nervous system and spike the symptoms of post herpetic neuralgia. Patient spoke to her doctor but nobody knows anything. Nobody was willing to help her. Patient felt like she was dying. She didn&#39;t want to die. Patient feel the symptoms are getting worst. She was burning up inside. Her pain was around the bottom of the foot now it&#39;s on top of the foot and goes up to knee. Patient was not blaming anybody but she thought it was the vaccine. Patient was sweating, wet, perspiring all night. The symptoms usually occur at night. Patient wanted to know if these symptoms were associated with the vaccine. Patient also mentioned she developed a bladder infection for which she was taking antibiotics. Patient had Pfizer vaccine on 02Feb2021, about 5 days ago. Patient followed instructions before vaccine. Doctor said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) before the vaccine for a headache. Patient did that. Patient had injection and told to wait for 15 minutes before she went home. About 5 minutes, she was relaxed and sitting down. Vaccination given in left arm. All of a sudden she had a very strange feeling in her body on 02Feb2021. Something was going across the top and right side like a fluid was flowing or something strange. Then it felt like a straight line down her right foot and it stopped. Was a feeling like maybe the liquid of the vaccine went that way. Didn&#39;t have a vein going that way. Patient was afraid. She went home and didn&#39;t remember the next thing that happened. Every night she has gotten more sick. Patient had a feeling in her foot where she had shingles a few years ago. After shingles had post-herpetic neuralgia. Patient always had burning on bottom of her foot and would put it in ice water. Patient could handle that because it was just uncomfortable. After injection, she got so bad, the post-herpetic neuralgia was on her whole foot and it started to burn. It went up a little towards the knee or higher. Yesterday, at times, it quickly went over to the left leg. Patient had a fever every day and every night. Patient took paracetamol to cut the fever. Patient was coughing on call but stated that was nothing and the coughing was something she had. Every night she felt like her body was burning up in side. Felt like she was burning alive. Got all wet with perspiration. She changed clothes and every night it got worse. Patient called emergency, they listened to her, stating they have never heard of anything like this. Asked patient if she wanted to go to emergency. She stated ok. The doctor listened to her story and told her it was weird. Doctor told her to give it a few more days to up to eight days. Doctor wanted her to get a urine test, but she couldn&#39;t urine, patient tried for a long time in the bathroom and only got a few drops of urine out and it was brown. Not normal urine. Next day patient called 911. She wanted to be assured she was not dying at home. Did have room available at the hospital. Patient had to sit in a wheelchair and there was no bed for her to lie down in. Last time she was admitted from the emergency. Next day she came home and had to call emergency again. Really thought she was burning up. Patient didn&#39;t want to go to the hospital and suffered at home. Next night and third night was so bad. Patient couldn&#39;t urinate anymore. She had a fever, but not a high fever, because the paracetamol cut the fever. Temperature was 100 degrees. On the inside she thought she was being burned up a live. Never got better, always got worse. Yesterday, she was in the hospital all day. Now she has an infection in her bladder. Was put on a machine and everything. Had a long procedure, and got the urine going. Patient didn&#39;t miss not urinating. Has accidents like when she sneezes or cough. Usually gets up 2-3 times at night to urinate. When she finally realized she couldn&#39;t urinate, the doctor kept her there for a long time, eight hours. Was put on the machine, thought she may need a catheter. Her bladder was massaged in order to get her to urinate. Patient only had the left kidney. Correct problem about the urine. Doctor told her to make sure she goes back for second dose on 23Feb2021, but she was afraid. In the morning she was a little better, couldn&#39;t handle this. Patient was very weak and tired. One night she was in the emergency and didn&#39;t sleep because of the procedures. Patient didn&#39;t think the needle went in all of the way when the nurse administered her vaccine. Sensation started on the left, went across her chest, straight down like an arrow. Like something was trickling down to the end of her foot and stopped. Patient had symptoms every night since. So severe patient thought she was burning up. Patient got worse every night and didn&#39;t get any better. Patient said feeling at COVID-19 Vaccine injection site was not a natural thing. Last time she was in the hospital her blood pressure went up to 184. After COVID-19 Vaccine patient lost a little weight. Same time had this problem, was seeing a doctor with a colon specialty. Had so much constipation for a long time and tried to correct it with mediation. Medication was too strong and gave her diarrhea. Doctor thought maybe she had colon cancer. Stopped the medication. Wasn&#39;t 100% healthy, but that was just cramps. Patient eats very little now, not very hungry. Patient feels good in her bowels after something good from a restaurant. Patient attempted to clarify the medication that was too strong. She stated it was over the counter. She stated it was something that had to be mixed. She was supposed to take a cap full and mix it with 8 ounces of liquid. Needed something to make her have a bowel movement. Only took it for two days. Was way before the vaccine. It was too strong and she stopped it. Patient took a probiotic. After that patient was given gas relief medication called: Gas Relief Extra Strength Simethicone, 125mg. Provided: V11496, MSRS 53041 REV 0417, and 883928. Patient no longer has constipation. Now it is the opposite. Now bowel movements are soft and pasty. Patient tried a stool softener that didn&#39;t work, was worthless. Was over the counter. Patient didn&#39;t take stool softeners after the COVID-19 Vaccine. All the events started from Feb2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 92-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (upper arm) on 20Jan2021 11:00 (at the age of 92years) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer, second right breast lumpectomy related to breast cancer from 16Oct2020 to an unknown date, first right breast lumpectomy related to breast cancer on an unknown date (done about 3-4 years prior to second right breast lumpectomy related to breast cancer), on blood thinner, allergic to the statins and allergy to unknown product (She was once given something, some medication for her heart, but about 5- 6 weeks later she developed a reaction to it so she was taken off the medication but does not remember the name of the drug.) The patient would consider herself obese at this weight, but that is probably because she was always very thin historically; her doctor has never diagnosed her as being obese or advised her to lose weight. The patient&#39;s daughter had a very, very aggressive form of breast cancer-she is deceased 11 years. Patient&#39;s younger sister had breast cancer; there is a lot of breast cancer on her husband&#39;s side- his mother, sister, niece all had breast cancer, they have a big history of breast cancer; other types of cancer in patient&#39;s family include her mother who died of pancreatic cancer in her 80s; and her dad had prostate cancer but he was in his upper 80s; and patient&#39;s older sister died of leukemia. Concomitant medications included warfarin from an unspecified date at 5 mg (daily x 2 days/week) then 2.5 mg (daily x remaining 5 days/week) as blood thinner and metoprolol from an unspecified date at 25 mg, 2x/day (morning and evening) for an unspecified indication. The patient previously had Flu shot. The patient reported that she got on last Thursday (21Jan2021) the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine at 11 o&#39;clock. She did not feel anything wrong at the moment (also reported as she had no immediate reaction at all). A couple of days after (About maybe 2-3 days later sort of in the middle of the day, not the morning) she started to feel extremely unwell, feverish (although thermometer did not indicate any raise) tired and malaise she was really surprised because it occurred that long after administration. She took Tylenol and she was looking to know if this has been reported as a side effect of the vaccine and how to treat it. She was very concerned about it because she has never had an adverse event with any vaccine or inoculation before. She takes a yearly flu shot and never had any reaction. Feverish: She has taken her body temperature with her digital thermometer which does not show a fever, it shows like 97.5-97.6 degrees Fahrenheit so not a fever; but she feels feverish. On 26Jan2021 the injection site started itching and she looked at site which is way up high so she can&#39;t turn her neck that way; but found a strange area around the injection site that is about the size of a silver dollar, red around the outer rim and kind of orangeish colored in the middle. She has never had that occur before, and the skin in the middle of the area, the orangeish colored area has no pain. She reported that there was a mass of people at the location where she was administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. There were hundreds of people there when she was for inoculation event so she is wondering if she could have picked up COVID while there. She called to ask about these events related to the product.  She has no major allergies. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on an unspecified date which included body temperature: 97.5-97.6-degree Fahrenheit. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She said her mother takes a Warfarin 1mg tablet daily on Monday through Friday, and a 1/2 Warfarin 1mg tablet (0.5mg) on Saturday and Sunday. She said the Warfarin is dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date. She said her mother has been on Warfarin for around 20 years, since her mother had a blood clot. Reported her mother takes a stomach medication, clarified as Omeprazole 20mg capsule once a day. She said her mother has been on Omeprazole for years. She said the Omeprazole 20mg capsule was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot and Expiration Date. She said her mother&#39;s stomach had been fine. She said her mother didn&#39;t get sick to her stomach, until the night she was released from the Emergency Room (20Feb2021). She said when her mother sat up and tried to stand while she was in the Emergency Room on Saturday night (20Feb2021), her mother was dizzy, and felt weak and shaky. She said her mother was given some orange juice and peanut butter crackers at the time. She said her mother&#39;s stomach became upset then. She said she thinks her mother&#39;s stomach upset had more to do with having the orange juice and peanut butter crackers than anything else. She said her mother has never had nose bleeds or headaches before. She said her mother has blood pressure issues that she takes blood pressure medicine for. She said she thinks the COVID-19 Vaccine may have exasperated her mother&#39;s issues. Reported on Sunday (21Feb2021), her mother didn&#39;t seem much better to her. She said her mother&#39;s blood pressure was up, her mother was dizzy, weak and had a bad headache. She said her mother has a healthy appetite for 92 years old and her mother didn&#39;t want anything to eat. She said she ended up calling 911 because her mother wasn&#39;t making any sense when she talked. She clarified her mother was picked up by the ambulance at 9:00PM on Sunday (21Feb2021); and admitted to the hospital. She said her mother is still in the hospital as of today, Tuesday, 23Feb2021. She said her mother had a CT scan, a MRI, and an EEG. She said the CT scan, and MRI were negative, and the EEG results were not back yet. She said her mother may be released home today, 23Feb2021, depending on the EEG results. Reported her mother has never had nose bleeds or headaches before. Reported on Sunday, 21Feb2021, she took her mother&#39;s blood pressure. She said her mother was very weak and incoherent. She said her mother was unable to comprehend the way she usually does. Reported her mother has had no more nose bleeds since yesterday 22Feb2021.  She said her mother is still quite weak, but her blood pressure is now under control. She said her mother has been on a stroke watch while at the hospital, and her mother has not been allowed to get up out of bed as of last night (21Feb2021). She said the hospital staff are supposed to let her mother walk today (23Feb2021) to see if her mother&#39;s blood pressure stays stabilized. She said her mother&#39;s comprehension is not at the same level as prior to being hospitalized. She clarified her mother still drives a car at 92 years old and takes care of her own check book. She said she doesn&#39;t know if her mother will still be able to do that at this time. Reported her mother was checked for a UTI while at the hospital. She said the hospital went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI without knowing if her mother had a UTI. She said because her mother is elderly, a lot of times the elderly have UTIs. She said the hospital didn&#39;t want to waste time and went ahead and treated her mother for a UTI because her mother hadn&#39;t been on antibiotics recently. The caller stated she did not have any information on the medications her mother has been given while at the hospital. Reported at first she did not think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with her mother&#39;s first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, but then there was a new part to her mother&#39;s story that made her think her mother&#39;s symptoms had to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller stated she is apprehensive for her mother to go get her second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure abnormal: up on 18Feb2021, Head CT: negative on Feb2021, Head CT: negative for stroke on 20Feb2021, EEG: unknown results on Feb2021, MRI brain: negative on Feb2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of nose bleeds, blood pressure increased, dizzy, weakness, shaky.

A 93-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL1283) intramuscular injection in right upper arm, near her shoulder on 21Jan2021 10:00 AM at single dose for preventative. Medical history and concomitant medication were none. patient reported side effects to the pfizer vaccine after the first dose last Thursday 21Jan2021. Caller reported headache, chills, pain in arm and feeling like she has a fever. Caller stated pfizer should have two dose, one for small people and one for large people. Reporter asked what the timing of the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is and if she could receive it earlier or later than 3 weeks.  Caller stated she received the first Pfizer dose on 21Jan2021 and her second dose is on 18Feb2021. She is calling about the Pfizer BioNtech Covid vaccine. She had the vaccine last Thursday on 21Jan2021. She started having the usual aches, headaches, and pain. On Saturday (23Jan2021) she started getting chills and by the evening she felt warm and feverish, when she checked her temperature it was 98. Last night, she felt like her body was burning up but her temperature was 98. She felt miserable and could not sleep all night. States she attributed it to the vaccine since she was feeling ok prior to the vaccine. She is asking if she should get the second dose. Weight: 95 to 98 pounds, she suggests that those that are smaller like her be given a smaller dose since she weighs so little. She is nervous about getting the second dose which is scheduled on 18Feb2021. She felt like she was burning up and it drained her. She keeps taking her temperature but she does not have a fever. She did not sleep last night. She feels better today. She is aching a bit today but not as much as she did. She is tired since she did not sleep last night. She still has the chills. States it is weird since she feels like she has a high temperature but does not have a high temperature or fever. She hears that there is usually not side effects with the first injection and usually there are side effects with the second injection. She did not feel the vaccine when it was administered. Her chills on Sunday was really bad and today it is better. The burning up/ hot feeling started gradually on Saturday and then on Sunday it got worse. She does not feel as hot and it has improved right now. it was also reported pain in injection site. Relevant Tests was none. no AEs following prior vaccinations. The last outcome of did not sleep last night and tired was unknown, of the events was recovering. It was a non-serious report. Event were not required a visit to Emergency Room nor Physician Office.

                                                Injection site became pink, 3X5 inches, the day following the shot.  On 2.11.2021, about 55 hours after vaccination #2, pt developed generalized weakness, nausea, and then vomited.  She was taken to bed, where she rested poorly and only dozed off for 1-2 minutes at a time and was mumbling words.  She  continued with generalized weakness, nausea with dry heaves, a sensation of marked shortness of breath, and inability to stand without support.  Complained of feeling hot and then cold.  Appeared pale and lethargic, skin clammy and complained of difficulty breathing and was irritable. Lung sounds -clear, no wheezing despite being unable to speak more than a few words at time. Vitals at 10:00pm:  HR 62, pulse weak, O2 sat 92% (normal for her), temp 101.7F (her normal temp is 95-96).  Given a Tylenol extra strength 500mg, 2.5 mg Prednisone, increased O2 nasal canula to 3-4 L/min, and cold compresses to reduce fever and discomfort.   Vitals at 10:15p:  HR 93, O2 sat 92%, BP 131/59. Discussed going to the ER, but decided to wait until the morning if not better. Symptoms continued until ~ 2am, when she was able to fall deep asleep for 4 hours.  Awoke and felt better, able to walk, but still a bit weak and short of breath.  By noon Feb 12 she felt mostly back to normal.

A 94-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 (around 3:15 PM to 3:20 PM) at 0.3 mL, single (0.3ml dose injection in right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, blood thinner and fluid. The patient historical vaccine included varicella zoster vaccine live (ZOSTAVAX) for immunization. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect as this was the first dose. The patient had no prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. Concomitant medications included ongoing apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood thinner, ongoing furosemide (LASIX) for fluid, valsartan for blood pressure, ongoing pravastatin for cholesterol. The reporter was calling because her mother had the COVID-19 Vaccine on 07Jan2021, it was on a Thursday. By that Friday (08Jan2021) she was not feeling that well. Caller stated she did not know if what occurred had any correlation to the vaccine, but she wanted to report these details in case this started to be came a problem. Her mother is 94 years old and was in very good shape. However, now she was in the hospital completely disoriented. Since getting the vaccine she had subsequently broke out with shingles two days after getting the vaccine on 09Jan2021. Caller reiterated she was not saying this had anything to do with the vaccine, but she just wanted to reported these events. Caller initially stated it was unknown why patient was admitted to the hospital. She went on to explain her mother, the patient, was complaining of pain and burning. She started complaining of this pain and burning in the evening like around 5PM (on 08Jan2021 17:00). She later broke out into shingles. Caller mentioned patient has not had the SHINGRIX vaccine yet. However, she did have the older vaccine, ZOSTAVAX. Caller confirmed patient received the ZOSTAVAX years before. Patient went to the Emergency Room the first time on 09Jan2021 due to complaining of pain and burning and they could not find anything wrong with her. They checked her vitals and ran several tests and it all came back fine. They then sent her home. Patient went back to the Emergency Room on 10Jan2021 and completed another battery of test, labs, checked vitals, had chest x-ray, and cat scan at this time they could not diagnose with Shingles. On 11Jan2021, the patient had an appointment with her Primary Doctor and he did not find anything wrong. Patient came home with caller&#39;s sister and she was helping her get undressed. That was when the sister noticed a rash on the patient&#39;s body. The rash broke out on her body on Monday 11Jan2021. They tried to call the doctor that night, but did not get a response. On Tuesday 12Jan2021 they took the patient to urgent care and that was when she was formally diagnosed with Shingles. She was started on medication for the Shingles, Acyclovir, and sent home. They also thought she had a slight Urinary Tract Infection. She was started on CIPRO for the urinary tract infection. Patient was home for a couple of days in Jan2021 and she was not getting any better. She was then starting to lose her mental faculties. They thought this was from the urinary tract infection. Caller clarified the patient was then admitted to the hospital on 16Jan2021 due being disoriented. For causality assessment, it was mentioned that it is so coincidental this happened right after getting the vaccine. She was healthy and then it was like a snowball. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2  on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 94-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration (right arm) on 21Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE (arm right) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included left shoulder pain (on medication for years) from an unspecified date, and elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021. Concomitant medication included hydrocodone for left shoulder pain. On 24Jan2021, the patient experienced real tired and she even slept 14 hours the night before. Reporter was wondering if tiredness is a side effect of the product. The patient also had an elbow that she fell on two weeks before on Jan2021, and three days after getting the vaccine (24Jan2021), that elbow started hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm. The reporter was unsure of the lot number reported as E13249 or EL3249 (unsure which lot number is his, and which is the one his wife received). The patient received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the event &#34;elbow starting hurting more, and it was on the same arm as the side she got the injection on, the right arm&#34; was not recovered. Outcome of events &#34;is real tired and she even slept 14 hours last night&#34; was unknown.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

During the 15 minute waiting period, the patient developed headache, then began to have chest pressure and shortness of breath.  She was given depo medrol 80 and benadryl 50mg.  She was further evaluated and found to have blood pressure of  200/100 and oxygen saturation was 80 % .   She was transferred right away to ambulance and transported to ER.  She was able to stand on her own to transfer to the gurney to be transported.  We have not been able to have follow up as of yet; she is not a patient of Health Center so records have not come to me (nor can they be released to me) from the hospital.   We are continuing to try to reach the patient or her family to follow up on this case.    I will update this report as more information becomes available to me.   * the Regional Covid-19 Vaccine Clinic is a collaborative effort of Health Center, the Health Dept, Regional Hospital, and Pharmacy.  Vaccines are given to all qualified residents, so the patients coming through on a certain day may or may not be the patients of the physicians working that day.

A 95-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3246, expiration date: 30Jan2021) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included walks with a walker, both knees replaced a year ago on 11Mar2020 (prior to receiving the vaccine), she had the mucus in her throat and a little bit of a cough prior to getting the vaccine. She had allergies. She normally has the mucus and cough in the morning when she gets up. She is also blowing her nose a lot. There were no concomitant medications. The patient was starting to get hot and cold. She was unsure if she has a fever as she does not have anything to measure it with. She gets hot and sweaty. She feels good but is hungry and eating like crazy on 09Jan2021. She is talking and breathing fine. Getting hot and cold and hot and sweaty: Happened a few days after the vaccine. She was unsure what day, maybe the day before yesterday, or yesterday and today. Yesterday she took a shower and she also took some guaifenesin (MUCINEX). This made her feel better. For example, she had lunch a while ago and she did not feel like doing anything. She felt lazy. She usually swims at 6 AM Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and she did not go. Her friend said this was not like her. She also did not want to shower yesterday. She kept putting it off and then she finally showered and felt terrific. Her body felt like her body. She has always been a good eater, but since the vaccine she has been more hungry and eating more. Right now, she is starting to get warm as she is talking. It will go away and come back a little while later. Outcome of the events &#39;getting hot and cold&#39; and &#39;gets hot and sweaty&#39; was recovering and not recovered for the other events.

A 95-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 10:15 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) with lot number: EL3249 on 20Jan2021 in right arm. After receiving the 2nd dose on 10Feb2021, the patient became ill on 11Feb2021, while sitting on the toilet, she became nauseous and vomiting repeatedly even dry heaves also then became dizzy and felt a tingling in my face and right hand didn&#39;t feel like the patient could get up on her own so the patient&#39;s son and daughter assisted her to her bed. She didn&#39;t know what was wrong and her daughter thought it was a side effect of the vaccine and called the nurse on call. After arriving at the emergency and was examined the patient was told she was being kept for observation since she had just had the vaccine. The patient was later told she also had a mild heart attack and to her knowledge I never had any heart issues. She could then no longer use her walker to walk because she couldn&#39;t bear weight on her right hand. She was hospitalized for 8 days and transferred to rehab and I&#39;m still in rehab. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalized and disability). The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received treatment for the events.

A 95-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Mar2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 02Mar2021. The patient was reported to have possible side effects that was getting worse. The patient had &#34;chills, fever, nasal congestion, upper respiratory difficulty breathing, non-productive cough.&#34; On Monday evening, 29Mar2021, the patient was brought to the hospital but tests showed that &#34;everything looked good&#34; (chest x-ray etc.) Last night, the patient&#39;s temperature reached 104 F and was given paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient mentioned that she was &#34;breathing rapid,&#34; and that she &#34;coughs when she takes a breath.&#34; Reporter asked if patient can be given an antihistamine; or something to help with the upper respiratory concern (nose blockage, upper respiratory breathing). The patient had not been well. They spent Monday evening and all night and in the morning at the hospital. They did X-rays and lab work and everything else. The doctors couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with her and stated that it&#39;s got to be the vaccine. She was really in bad shape at this point. She can&#39;t be out of bed for 2 seconds without having to get back into bed. She was having a upper respiratory thing going on. She had a fever as high as 104.5 last night. The fever was last night and she got paracetamol (TYLENOL) for that and brought it down. It did respond. The patient stated she can&#39;t breathe through her nose and she has upper respiratory problems. The problem was when they went to the hospital, they didn&#39;t find signs of infections, all normal across the board. The patient doesn&#39;t fake it, she was a feisty elderly lady. She walks up the hill every day. She was independent. Normally, she can walk and walks very well without any assistance. The patient now can barely walk. She can barely walk to the toilet without holding on to anything. She was constantly complaining about chills. Reporter wanted to know what can they do and not do and what should the doctors be looking at. They kind of just threw up their hands as this was side effects of the vaccine, but the patient was alarming on Monday night and even more alarming right now. The patient was in bad shape. She wasn&#39;t feeling good on Saturday night, but not too bad on Friday night. Reporter asked her mom how she felt on Friday. Reporter told her mom to put in her hearing aids, that would probably help. Reporter further explained that patient had a sore arm around the injection site and that she might not have been feeling that great. On Saturday, she was not feeling well and started to have a fever, sinus infection and upper respiratory problems. The patient stated that she finally identified it. Reporter confirmed the fever, sinus infection, and upper respiratory problems started on 27Mar2021 towards the late afternoon she was  progressively getting worse. Fever, sinus infection, chills, upper respiratory problems all have worsened. The reporter stated that her mother&#39;s (patient&#39;s) arm pain got better on Sunday and was now gone. On Saturday, her arm hurt from her shoulder to her elbow, it did get worse. However, a the next day it was gone pretty much. Monday in the emergency room, they did labs for her kidney, liver and were looking for infection. They did not find anything came up normal on everything. Today, the reporter thinks patient was worse. She doesn&#39;t want to come out of bed at all. She was laying there like a lump, whining and crying which she has never done. She was probably going to take her to the hospital again and  they were not going to do anything again. She stated that something got to change, They haven&#39;t had that conversation about going to the hospital. She was going to go downhill if this continues, it had gone downhill at this point. Reporter confirmed that patient has recovered completely from the arm pain while outcome of remaining events was not recovered.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

Recreational Therapist was in room with patient who was at baseline mentation at that time, and was getting patient a cup of tea.  Rec Therapist observed patient to &#34;all of a sudden slouch down toward left side&#34; and became unresponsive.  Therapist called for help, and Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Nurse Aide (CNA) came into room.  Patient was initially non-responsive and profusely sweating and hot to touch.  Vitals  were taken (see below).  The patient then slowly became responsive after approximately 4 minutes and was visibly nauseous  and appeared like she was going to vomit, but ultimately did not.  Patient was assisted into bed, APRN was called, order for vital signs to be taken every 4 hours for 72 hours, and Electrocardiogram (EKG) to be performed.   EKG results were abnormal, indicative of infarct; APRN ordered transport to Emergency Department.   Patient returned from Hospital ED at approximately 10:45 PM same day (1/28/21), with transfer paperwork documenting  a  Hospital diagnosis of &#34;Syncope&#34; without any additional lab results or any new medication or treatment orders in the documentation.  Follow up the next day (1/29/21) by RN at the Nursing Facility--RN logged into the Hospital medical Charting system, only to find that there was no record whatsoever of the patient being in the Emergency Department on 1/28/21--no notes, no labs, no summary from a practitioner.  Patient recovered and has resumed close-to-baseline activity and functioning.

                                                The above info is available but it is as my mothers....She had a bad reaction ( very flu like for several days). I proceeded with second shot in February....she did not feel well, but just sorta didn&#39;t want to get up anymore. She slept more and more and more. Her appetite declined. I got her up and she was ravenous. She slept more and seemed in a lethargic way to take less and less interest. She was living independently and had been most of her life. We scheduled an internist report. She passed labs with flying colors....... when you are 96 they look at everything as remarkable ( will live for 10 more years). I also was not equating any of this with the vaccine. However, we could not ignore it any longer Saturday the 4-10-21. I took her to ER. She was lucid and walking with difficulty. I took her in by ambulance as she was just saying, &#34;I&#39;m so week!&#34; I&#39;m so whoozie! On Sunday they are talking immediate intensive rehab. Neurologist leave for 5 days and in next 48 hours she becomes 200% less. First delusional, then sleeps all day. He showed me an MRI that to a layperson looked like little hives all over the brain ( I had also gotten hives from somewhere on my skin that I originally equated with Covid but no one thought so. I have also had the two shots.) One week out I was looking at Hospic eand long term care placement. Yesterday they couldn&#39;t get a diagnosis for Hospice ( the person sent to sign her up). I thought what? After all these tests and  maybe it is cardio, maybe it is exchemic  strokes, they don&#39;t have a diagnosis because she hasn&#39;t changed much since 2017? We have to take this totally fine independent  woman and in one week say, &#34;She has Dementia?&#34; It&#39;s possible but what caused it? It&#39;s not age......we live until we are 110. Yes, that MRI showed me little formations of clotting all over ( no major bleed if any in a lobe). Over the last week I have been looking at her health and how we just slowly went downhill. It&#39;s easy to blame a vaccine, but still..........I am saying that there were NO OTHER reasons other than she didn&#39;t seem to tolerate the shots well........first was acute, and the second was long term and slow...........

We met with the doctor on zoom after labs who said it was okay at her age to sleep all the time. She was up each day previously from 7 a.m to 6 pm.She was dizzy and ate less but functioned. Finally, after continuing to go downhill she asked to go to Emergency. After 10 days they were unable to diagnose and released her to a nursing facility under the guise of dementia. She had never had dementia ever. the shot scrambled her entire muscular system including voice, tongue, etc all below the neck.

A 96-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Leukaemia in 2018, High blood pressure with 40 years, Diabetes in 2016, Atrial fibrillation in 2018.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Batch/lot number: EN6199) in left arm on 07Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. She had just had her blood drawn in Feb2021 and her blood was ok. So on 07Mar2021 she received her first Covid 19 vaccine. At 96 years old, after the Covid 19 vaccine, her mother&#39;s body was full blown with leukemia. Radiation wasn&#39;t an option to stop the overproducing of her white blood cells. The Covid 19 vaccine just accelerated it. Maybe there are others out there in this condition and should be double checking to see if they should get the Covid 19 vaccine.  On the 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021 her mother started having a hollow cough. She wasn&#39;t congested but she continued to cough. She noticed her mother was breathing heavy and fighting to breathe on Friday, on16Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t getting any better and she thought her mother would have more trouble so she took her to the emergency room. She reported she took her mother to the hospital on 16Apr2021.She was admitted on 16Apr2021 and discharged on 18Apr2021. They gave her some oxygen and did some tests. They asked her mother if she had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and she did not, they suggested that it was her atrial fibrillation. She has had atrial fibrillation in the past, her doctor did leave her on her atrial fibrillation medication. She can&#39;t recall the name of the atrial fibrillation medication. She was discharged home on 18Apr2021 and she was breathing ok on her own. But by that next Tuesday, 20Apr2021, she noticed her mother was declining. She wasn&#39;t acting like herself. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, she was more tired and her difficulty breathing started back up. On Thursday, 22Apr2021, she called the ambulance to take her mother to the hospital. She could tell that her mother wasn&#39;t herself, she could hardly talk on 22Apr2021 , she couldn&#39;t stand up, she lost control of her bowels. She wasn&#39;t responding to her. The caller knew something was going on. They put oxygen on her mother and they transferred her to a cancer specialist hospital. That&#39;s when the doctor realized it was a leukoblast. Clarified with caller, leukoblast. Then her mother died. She died on 28Apr2021.The caller knows the hospital was doing tests to see what was causing her mother&#39;s pain, but she doesn&#39;t have that information. She heard the screams from her mother and there was no consoling her mother. The hospital gave her mother morphine and it didn&#39;t work. She has no product information for the morphine, it was given in the hospital. She was screaming for murder, screaming for help and was given the morphine. Within a month of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine her leukemia was back and her mother was screaming in agony and pain because her sides were blowing up in pain. Whatever the Covid 19 vaccine did in her body, her body thought it was fighting off something. She had no red blood cells that could provide oxygen to her organs. She was weak. Overproducing of her white blood cells on an unspecified date. The lab data included White blood cell count abnormal and Red blood cell count decreased. Outcome of her mother&#39;s body was full blown with leukemia/she wasn&#39;t responding was fatal, of remaining events was unknown. Treatment received for all events. The seriousness of event breathing heavy and fighting to breathe were reported as hospitalization from 16Apr2021 to 18Apr2021. The seriousness criteria of she wasn&#39;t responding was reported as hospitalization from 22Apr2021 to 28Apr2021.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Fatal Neoplasm progression

Everyday after she got 10% better and as of this notice she still isn?t back 100%.. She better than she was but suffering from the effects. She?s not going to get second shot because she says it will kill her. I want her to get it but if the 2nd shot is worse than first I can?t in good conscience let her get it.

                                                One day after injection,  acted the exactly the same as she did the day she was hospitalized for COVID at  Hospital in Dec 2020. She had fever around 101F, was too weak to sit up or feed herself or do anything other than lay down. She did not respond to tylenol. I got a virtual visit with her doctor,  to decide if to go to the e.r. and we agreed to try one more tylenol in the late afternoon and she got slightly better, so we delayed hospitalization. So after that she slowly recovered over several days. She was weak for about a week. Her doctor suggested she not get the second dose because she probably still has lots of antibodies in her and had an antibody reaction. I&#39;m a reporting this because i want to know if people who had COVID and only one dose of vaccine with a severe COVID like reaction like this can be officially considered &#34;immune &#34; and get a vaccine &#34;passport&#34;. Could you let us know.

She had difficulty swallowing, was unable to feed herself, and was extremely lethargic. She was unable to remain awake all day and had to be shaken unusually hard to wake up. She appeared confused/ disoriented upon waking. She did not have a fever or report of any pain. Her BP, pulse, and O2 were all normal.  She did present with any indications of a stroke. Slight improvement began late afternoon on 2/2/21. On 2/3/21 all of these conditions had disappeared and she was back to her normal self and activities.

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.

A 98-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right Arm on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9261) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cholesterol, blood pressure, synthetic thyroid replacement, kidney and breast cancer survivor. Concomitant medication(s) included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) taken for thyroid therapy, start and stop date were not reported, vitamins,  Cholesterol medication, Blood Pressure medication. The patient previously had a flu shot.  The reporter said her 99-year-old mother received the 1st dose of the Pfizer-; had mild symptoms. Her mom is 99 and in good health. Her dad lived until 110. Her mom had first Pfizer shot through the assisted living facility on 17Jan2021. During routine testing her mom tested positive for COVID 25Jan2021. She had mild symptoms that started on the 26Jan2021. She was tired. Her energy level was gone and she had low fever. For prevention and to stay safe she had monoclonal antibodies infused on 29Jan2021. After that, she got really bad with fever and sweats. She never had trouble breathing. When taking her back from receiving the monoclonal antibodies, her mom had chills and was feeling horrible. They said it was progression of the disease. It took a month for her to get her strength back, but now she is great. She wasn&#39;t strong when she was due for second shot on 07Feb2021 and she didn&#39;t get it because they didn&#39;t want to stress her. She didn&#39;t have any stamina at that point. Now caller has been reading that some people say wait 90 days after monoclonal antibodies for the second dose. Her mom&#39;s thyroid doctor said not to give it. Her mom got better within the month, but would tire easily. She would be spent and couldn&#39;t do anymore. Now she is back to normal. She is up all day and stays up until 11PM.The outcome of the events was not reported.

At 12:00 pm, she complained of worsening fatigue and blurry vision.  At 3:40 pm, she complained of loss of appetite but denied fever and chills.  The niece was unable to reach her by phone after 4 pm, so she came over to the decedent?s residence at 6:15 pm to check on her.  The niece found her lying face up in bed ?gasping for air.?  She then became unresponsive and EMS was called.  The decedent was pronounced at 8:11 pm after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts.  Autopsy showed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with marked partially calcific coronary atherosclerosis; marked pulmonary edema; and pleural effusions.  The brain was saved for neuropathology given the history of blurry vision.
