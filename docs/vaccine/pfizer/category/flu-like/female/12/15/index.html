                                                My daughter is experiencing periodically nose bleeds, brain fog and bit distracted and losing herself in her thoughts after her first dose  Pfizer vaccine. This is new from the initial report. Her mother also states she feels fatigue and not active for a few days now.  At this time I have not been able to get an appointment to see her doctor and I am very concerned about her symptoms.   I would like more research or documentation to be released about this type of group to figure out why this happened to her. Also, I would like to see if they are going to be monitored after her vaccine. I do not know what other side effects will be coming after her vaccine and I am concerned.

                                                Client received her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine (lot # EW0185 exp. 08/2021) at 11:28 AM. The client was brought to the EMT station by lead RN stating that the client was feeling &#34;dizzy? at 11:46 AM. The client was a 12-year-old female alert and tracking with her eyes and appeared anxious. The client had a chief complaint of lightheadedness. The client stated that she ?began to feel lightheaded? after her initial 15-minute observation had completed. This was the client&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and she stated reluctance to receive her first dose. The client denied any allergies and her parents stated that the client had a history of unspecified behavioral disturbances that require her to see a therapist. The assessment revealed no hives, swelling, discoloration, shortness of breath, or other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. The client denied a headache or wanting to throw up. The client refused to have her vitals taken by EMTbut agreed at 1150 to remain lying down until she felt better. The client was encouraged to drink water while she waited. After 15 minutes and drinking a bottle of water, the client stated &#34;I feel all better&#34; but &#34;I think I&#39;m overthinking this&#34; and stated that she was now experiencing a ?headache?. RN asked the client?s parents? permission to speak to the client. RN came over to reassess the client and that client finally agreed to have her vitals taken at 1208: 148/84 blood pressure, Pulse 94, 100% O2 on room air, Respirations 16, alert and oriented to person, place, date, and event. The client revealed to RN that she was experiencing anxiety from her vaccination but became much calmer after discussing her concerns further. Client also revealed that she engages in acts of self-harm but has no intent to end her life. The client&#39;s last set of vitals at 1216 were 128/76 BP, HR 96, O2 100%, Resp. 16. The client then stated that she was ?ready to go? after her last set of vitals. Lead RN asked to speak to client?s mother in private. Lead RN provided mother with crisis hotline. Mother informed lead RN that client was in therapy and already seeking help. The client&#39;s parents were instructed to seek emergency care if a significant allergic reaction occurred later in the evening and were provided with all relevant vaccine-related information by RN. The client departed at 1220 in a positive disposition with her parents.

                                                It was within 5 minutes, she started having hives that went down her arm and spread to other arm, face, trunk, legs, stomach. I went and got a nurse and she called a pediatric team - three nurses and one doctor - they took her vitals and gave her some Benadryl - 30 ML (children&#39;s). They had her sit and drink a bottle of water. We watched to see if the swelling and the hives would shrink and go away. It was probably about 20 minutes later where they went away, but she developed a headache and she was nauseated. We administered Benadryl (gave her regular 25 mg tablet every 6 hours)  for the next 24 hors in the dosage times. She was nauseated the first day and she had headache for two days. The hives went away by the time she went to bed the evening of the vaccine.

                                                Within 3-5 minutes, she was asking for water and feeling hot.  Her back was sweaty. Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

About 3:20 - her right arm and a little bit on her left arm were almost like hives (bumps) - they were a little bit itchy off and on. The next morning, could still the bumps but not as bad, but on 19th after school it was back just like the day before. We gave Benadryl to see if that would help. In the morning it goes away - on her arms, she can see a little a bit of where the lumps are - not as bad; on legs it&#39;s just almost completely gone, and by afternoon it&#39;s back to full scale of where it had been the night before.  Could see where the bumps were in her arm but it is  not as bad as it was. Today, as far as I know from the last time I asked her, she said there are still some on her arms but not on legs.

I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

                                                She started to get a sore throat and drainage the day after the first dose of the vaccine. That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

Somewhat itchy hives.  Administered Benadryl orally every 4 hours and topical hydrocortisone cream.  It is still there, but not an emergency or causing problems.  We will monitor and call the Dr. in the morning if it persists.

                                                did well acted right, felt right up until 5 AM this morning (6/4/21), she woke up throwing up over and over again, she couldn?t keep even a dissolvable Zofran down.  &gt; I immediately contacted her Hematologist and he told me to take her to the E.R.   &gt;  blood disorder, ?Hereditary Spherocytosis? came to life, flared up.  &gt;got extremely sick, where she could not walk or stand by 8:00 am this morning, when we arrived at the E.R. she had to be placed in a wheelchair because she was so weak.  &gt; Fluids, Pain medicine, Motrin, and nausea medication were given, plus rotating cool rags on her head to get her body temperature down.  &gt;  CBC, was off the charts, she has developed Anemia and was diagnosed this morning. &gt;  blood pressure dropped to 91/42.  &gt; I spoke with two hematologist on top of speaking with the 2 E.R. Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

                                                The night of the vaccine, towards the middle of the night she had a fever 103.2; little bit of a headache. Her fever went down through the night. In a.m., she was at 100 degrees. She started shaking and fainted when getting ready to go downstairs; Pulsometer - 147 for heart rate. She shook just a little. I thought she was going to have a seizure and I yelled for my husband and she regained consciousness. She hasn&#39;t had a fever since but we can&#39;t keep her heart rate down -it shoots up from 130- to low 150&#39;s. Still like that today. we took her to Dr. - he said it was reaction to vaccine. He referred her to cardiologist with an urgent designation. She&#39;s never had nay problems like this before. She will see cardiologist tomorrow. Rest and hydration is the current treatment. It hasn&#39;t gone away in the two or three days that they thought it would.

She also was coughing a very shallow, tight cough that was triggered by trying to take a deep breath. She rated the chest tightness a 7/10. By bedtime, fever down to 100.1 without any medication. Gave one ibuprofen for chest tightness. The next morning she was feeling much better and said she could barely feel chest tightness. As day progressed and over next several days, the symptom would come back, but was mild. Pediatrician saw her on 6/4 - no abnormal findings. Due to lingering , though mild symptoms over weekend, pediatrician made referral for cardiologist. Cardiologist performed EKG on 6/9 and results normal.

                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

Patient continued to have bloody emesis so presented back to ER where they did CXR which was normal, gave IVF bolus, zofran, repeat CBC with Hgb 12.4 and transferred to another hospital for higher level of care.  At the hospital, Initially made NPO and placed on IV fluids in preparation for possible endoscopy. Repeat labs showed stable hemoglobin compared to outside hospital. GI consulted and determined that hematemesis was most likely due to Mallory Weiss tear. Recommended carafate before meals, chloraseptic spray as needed for sore throat, continuing IV Protonix and IV zofran as needed, and gradually advancing her diet. On HD#3, she had another episode of hematemesis after eating solids. Overnight, tolerated liquids and solids without any further episodes of emesis. Tolerated transition from IV to PO meds and maintained hydration off of IV fluids. Due to symptom improvement, GI did not recommend endoscopy at this time and recommended that she be discharged on 1 week course of carafate, 2 month course of omperazole, and zofran as needed with plans for GI follow-up in 1-2 months.

An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

Mom reported to pharmacist staff that patient turned pale and felt dizzy. Pharmacist suggested patient to drink water and continued to rest while pharmacist monitored patient. Pharmacist tried to take patient&#39;s blood pressure but pharmacy didn&#39;t have the right cuff so she was  unable to obtain patient&#39;s blood pressure. Patient then was sweating and mom continued to give her water while pharmacist checked patient&#39;s temperature (recorded 94.6&#39;F). Few minutes later, patient vomited. Mom gave patient water after she was done vomiting. Patient reported she felt better afterwards. Patient was monitored for about 15 minutes and she was able to walk herself and left the pharmacy waiting area with mother. Pharmacist suggested mother to call doctor for follow up advice.

A few minutes post, her sister saw that she was slumped over &amp; her eyes had rolled to the back of her head. We tried to wake her up &amp; she was very lethargic. I gave her 2 small bottles of water, pb crackers, 3 hard candies &amp; elevated her feet. Mom said we didn&#39;t need to get medical attention. After about 10 minutes she was still very lethargic &amp; mom said yes to EMS when asked again. Another mom came over &amp; helped us lay her on the floor to elevate her feet above her head. Her husband came in &amp; assessed patient. Her pulse was 60 &amp; when he asked her to squeeze his fingers &amp; press against his feet it was week. She told us that she hadn&#39;t eaten a full meal since the night before, only had watermelon as a snack. The ambulance came &amp; took her.

She was put on the floor and she was conscious at that time.  We put a blanket under her head.  I took her BP and it was 111/67.  After 5 minutes she wanted to sit up and she sat in a chair and passed out again.  911 was called at that point.  We had her on the floor after that until the paramedics arrived.  They retook her bp and it was 111/63.  They checked her vitals and decided to take her to the ambulance just to give more privacy and have their equipment more readily available.

                                                Patient was a 12 year old female with a weight of 94 lbs who came into the clinic with her father for her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. During the interview, she stated that she did not have any adverse effects with her first dose. At 2:45 pm, after administering her second dose of 0.3 ml of Pfizer vaccine, I witnessed her having trouble standing up and assisted her back down into the seat. She vomited, was pale and diaphoretic. We elevated her legs up onto a bench and began fluid resuscitation. Her first BP was 71/55 and respiratory rate was unlabored. At 3:00 pm her second vitals were BP: 82/69, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 98, HR: 80.  At 3:07 pm her third vitals were BP:83/64, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 99, HR:74. We changed her position from legs elevated to 90 degree angle. Fluids and crackers were still being administered. At 3:16 pm her fourth vitals were BP: 94/76, RR; unlabored, SPO2: 85, HR 67.  At 3:30 pm her final vital signs were BP: 96/74, RR: 14, SPO2: 99, HR: 70. The patient was given a total of 60 oz of fluid and 1 pack of crackers.  I reassessed that the patient&#39;s hemodynamic status improved and her skin was warm and dry. The patient was alert and oriented throughout the process. Her father stated that she no longer looked pale. She was brought to the observation room for another 15 minutes and her father was informed about the progression of her condition. He was informed to refer to her pediatrician if there were any other adverse effects related to the vaccine or changes in her condition.

                                                6/12 - patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Worsened gradually with difficulty swallowing. 6/16 - presented to ED. Patient also reported rash in right lower extremity that is pruritic, 2 episodes of non-bloody non-bilious emesis daily since Saturday, intermittent chest pain and dyspnea, myalgias, diarrhea, generalized abdominal pain, and neck pain. Concern for infectious mononucleosis with lymphadenitis. Prescribed Augmentin and discharged home. 6/17 - returned to ED due to worsening rash (no longer pruritic) and diarrhea. Continued fever and neck pain. Hypotensive requiring 3L bolus and norepi. Large volume diarrhea. Mild AKI that resolved with fluid resuscitation. Treated broadly with antibiotics for toxic shock syndrome but rash was not consistent and cultures were negative, so eventually narrowed to ampicillin-sulbactam. Neck pain and swelling improved, but fever persisted through 6/19. Transferred to the floor on 6/20 and gradually improved without further intervention. Antibiotics were continued to target possible tonsillitis/lymphadenitis, but course did not seem to be truly responding to these antibiotics. CRP continued to increase despite antibiotics. Patient&#39;s presentation seemed most consistent with MIS-C; she also met criteria for incomplete KD with fever, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy and lab abnormalities, but this was felt less likely and she was not treated with IVIG or any other anti-inflammatories. Patient eventually improved and was discharged home 6/24.

                                                With the first dose: Headache (came and went frequently) dizzy(2-3 days) nausea (2-3 days) sore arm (3-4 days) gave ibuprofen for about 2 days and most symptoms went away. She continued to complain about a headache every once in awhile. About a week later I noticed  her eyes seemed a little yellow but it didn&#39;t seem to get worse and thought maybe she just need to drink more water and get some sleep.  After second dose: Bad headache (3-4 days) dizzy and nauseous (3 days) gave ibuprofen for 2 days. Two days after the vaccine she was fully jaundice. Hadn&#39;t notice because she was feeling bad from the vaccine so I just let her sleep mostly. Next day we got into see her primary care dr who ordered stat bloodwork and stat ultrasound. That same day she got some blood work back and told us to go to the er because her platelets were really low. At the er they diagnosed her with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which explained the jaundice. She was admitted and put on steroids. Her hemoglobin got as low as 5 and they cross matched her incase they needed to do a blood transfusion. They were concerned that there was a possibility that her immune system would attack the donor blood since it seemed to be attacking her platelets as well. Luckily the steroids started working and he levels creeped up a little. She also recieved 3 vitamin k transfusions and pain meds. When she was switched to oral steroids and her numbers were still rise they released her. She is still taking steroids and has weekly follow ups with Dr. . We are also in the process of getting a rheumatology referral to see if there is an underlying condition we didnt know about.

                                                My daughter experienced on day of her 2nd vaccine, feel nauseated in the evening time, then the second day. Felt very lethargic, fatigue, laying in bed all day, sleeping. She still had nausea also experienced chills, highest temp 99.8F. Her arm pit on the right side where she got the vaccine was really sore. She basically like within a couple of days she started her period cycle again and it was very heavy and lasted one week and half almost two weeks. On 06-08-2021, at about 10pm, she was brushing her teeth when she saw black spots and she went to tell me. At about 11:30pm that night, she squatted to pat our dog and when she got up and she felt really dizzy, lightheaded so I got concerned. Her symptoms persisted and I scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician on 06-15-2021. The pediatrician ruled out anemia. Her pediatrician said she has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Her pediatrician said that this is something manageable, she needs to strengthen her calf muscles and drink lots of water. They monitored her heart pressure and blood pressure.  Her heart rate had increased to 40bpm.  I also gave her Ibuprofen medication after the vaccine. Leading to today she has been having dizziness and light headiness every single day. My daughter is still  experiencing  symptoms, dizzy and light headed today.   For her 1st vaccine- within few days after her 1st dose, she experienced when using the treadmill, she would feel very dizzy. I did not think anything of it at first and this happened three times then it stopped. She also had a sore arm.

                                                Received the 1st dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 6/15/21. Patient had a headache, pain in left arm and felt tired. On 6/16/21 she woke up around 10:00am and said her legs felt numb or asleep from the ankle to mid thigh.  I contacted the pediatrician office and they advised us to wait and see if she had any other additional symptoms or changes. Patient said she could feel the sensation of pressure but could not feel what was touching her. She went to her usual swim team practice and seemed to be just fine except for the strange loss of sensation in her leg.s. On 6/17/21 her symptoms were unchanged upon waking up. She attended running club practice from 9-10:30am, and when I picked her up she said that now her left arm was experiencing the same loss of feeling from shoulder to her wrist. I took her to the pediatrician office, where they advised me to take her to the emergency room for further evaluation. She was  seen by two different doctors in the ER at Hospital, and no other tests were done at the time. The doctors advised us to keep monitoring her symptoms of loss of sensation and return if any other symptoms occurred. Since that time Patient has had some improvement in feeling but overall it has stayed the same. Doctors could not find any other possible causes for the symptoms either. They did recommend getting the 2nd dose but warned that the loss of sensation could get worse.

It started near the injection site, then on her wrist (same arm) then on her chin, same left side. After a few more days she started getting them all over: legs, chest etc. They itch her like crazy and burn when she tries not to itch.

She has pressure on her chest on 09Jun2021. She had pressure behind her eyes, muscle pain,she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills , sore throat, nauseous, caller states she was assuming hives, inflammation stayed around awhile , body aches / pain through her head and back down her neck, trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful , she was slumpy, swelling from the digging and scratching, her hands began to swell yesterday in Jun2021. she woke up and said her face felt funny on 09Jun202. she was just not feeling right and couldn&#39;t walk by herself on Jun2021, Caller relays her daughter will be (withheld) . HCP: Caller states she called the pediatrician office and 1 was by phone and she was seen by this provider yesterday and she encouraged her to reach out to us as well. Mom states she was aware of the possible symptoms to occur and her daughter came home Tuesday perfectly fine and went to bed and woke up with the typical symptoms, she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills, sore throat, nauseous and had all the symptoms pretty much. States she didn&#39;t have anything weird going on during the observation time the day of the vaccine. Caller relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. Caller states she took a nap Wednesday about 24 hours after her 2nd dose and she woke up and her lips had begun to swell and she woke up and said her face felt funny and it was itchy. Caller states she was assuming hives. Caller states that there was nothing concerning as it wasn&#39;t in that initial 15minutes to 4 hour and that this occurs 24 hours after and that was a concern. Caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch and that was kind of along the same lines and said hives and she would itch itch itch and there was swelling from the digging and scratching. Caller states she has numbness in her lip with the swelling. Caller states the other symptoms that are bizarre is more yesterday and it started some on Wednesday she had a pressure in her chest and this was a child, her daughter was very strong, she got up yesterday and tried to do school and had a fever of 102 and Wednesday evening was so sick with symptoms and she still tried. Caller states the pressure in her chest is concerning and told them yesterday and she needed to be seen. States her daughter described it to the doctor that it felt like someone was sitting on her chest sort of pressure and on a scale of 1-10 she was a 7. Caller provides that not at any time did she experience trouble breathing and she never saw her lose or get weird coloring. Caller states she called her doctor Wednesday afternoon and talked to another doctor, that she called the help line after hours as they close 4:30 or 5pm. States she was told it was good news that she did not have trouble breathing but to have it at this point was weird and no one knows what to expect and everyone is different. States she was told to do Benadryl and continue with pain medication for fever and discomfort. Caller states her daughter was miserable the rest of the evening. Caller relays that the swelling subsided and the inflammation stayed around awhile and yesterday she woke up better with no nausea and the common symptoms are better and she still had the fever. Caller relays that at about 9:00 she began to have a problem where she said that behind her eyes she had significant pressure and that scared the caller what with the brain and swelling. Caller states her hands began to swell yesterday, like her lip and her fingers are itchy and swelling and it&#39;s constant itching and the pressure on her chest yesterday, that those 3 things freaked the caller out and she called the pediatrician and they said to have her checked out to make sure as nobody wanted to rush her to the ER as she was not struggling to breathe she was just not feeling right. Caller states the pediatrician did her research about heart inflammation and listened to her heart a couple of times and said her best observation for rubbing sounds was she did not hear any. Caller states when her daughter was younger she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and caller states she does not immediately rush to the hospital as that brings back emotions with that. Caller states the doctor said she didn&#39;t see any immediate distress and would do an EKG or they could wait and see, that she thought the pressure might be like body aches and her daughter had laid in bed all day the day before and had a time with it. Caller states she couldn&#39;t walk by herself and she was out of it. Caller states she could do the EKG or wait until today and they chose to wait. States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She was nervous upon receiving her vaccine and after the shot was administered she stated she feels a little warm. The vaccinating pharmacist told her to sit and wait in the sitting area for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. A couple minutes after her vaccine was administered the girl started not feeling well and fainted in the store and her father caught her. We immediately called 911 and checked in with the young girl. The ambulance came and did a physical exam. They offered to take her to the hospital but the patient declined. Patient left the store shortly after with her father.

The severe headache has continued for 3 days.  Over the counter advil has not helped.  Headache is so severe that child is crying from pain.  Noises above a normal tone (including the sound of a piano playing) triggers the headache and worsens it.

                                                The day after my daughter received her vaccine, she began to feel congested and tired. This was on Sunday, May 23. We got up for school on Monday, May 24, but she was complaining about a really bad sore throat. The school nurse called and I picked her up from school because she was also getting more congested. She began to cough and sneeze constantly and took a long nap. When she woke, she was saying that she was getting short of breath and it felt like her heart was racing, even though she was just sitting. The next day her throat felt better, but the congestion was the same - still coughing and sneezing but her shortness of breath started getting more obvious. I emailed her pediatrician to ask about bringing her in, and they said to report this to the CDC and bring her if if she&#39;s not better in the next few days. Today is Wednesday, May 26 and she is still congested, short of breath and overall feels lousy. She is coughing up lots of mucus - greenish and thick. Yuck. I just gave her one pill of a mucus reducer to see if that would help. My biggest worry is about the shortness of breath because that is exactly what I experienced after my first dose of the vaccine. Mine was Moderna and I have seen dr&#39;s about it - and actually ended up in the hospital, but they do not believe it to be connected to the vaccine. I will contact them and let them know about my daughter&#39;s shortness of breath and perhaps they will think differently. Oh, she&#39;s had a slight fever of 99 F on occasions during this.

                                                She had an upset stomach and was feeling really tired. Then the  next morning, she had a rash - itchy and bumpy -   torso, back arms and face. Went to the Doctor and she said it looked like an allergic rash. She told us that based on my daughter&#39;s genetics and her asthma -  (I (her mother) had an anaphylaxis with my second Moderna shot  - my entire body was giant hives.)- That he did not recommend her to have the 2nd shot. My daughter still has some of the rash - a little on her left cheek, stomach and back still. The itching is gone. She did take Benadryl for it.

                                                On 05-22-2021, participant&#39;s mother states her daughter pain started at about 1:00AM. I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

                                                About 5 minutes following immunization, parent came to alert pharmacist that patient was experiencing nausea and light-headedness. Pharmacist observed that patient had a drowsy appearance and her eyes would periodically roll to the back of her head. Patient was also warm to the touch. She was given a cold pack which we placed on her wrists and she said that seemed to help. Patient remained under observation for about 20 minutes before she felt comfortable to leave the store.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

And then she woke up a minutes later while an employee called 911. She was fine and felt well but when we came back to our house, she was tired and slept 15 minute in my car. The next day, my daughter was fine, but after dinner we walk out near my house after 10 minutes she felt dizziness again.  She sat there for 10 minutes and she was fine. After that day, there were no symptoms.

She wasn&#39;t talking much, she started gagging and fainted again and her body started convulsing.  We believe she was having a seizure.  Patient has never had a seizure, her fever was high.  It only lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  When she stopped, she was able to walk with assistance back to her room.  We quickly gave her some medicine to bring down her fever.  Wet wash cloth and a fan on her.  I failed to take her temperature.  I was too concerned at what was going on.

The headache (and fatigue) continued Monday and Tuesday as well. But by that Tuesday afternoon 6/8, she was complaining that her vision was impaired.  She couldn&#39;t see things out of the right corner of her right eye. Example, when she looked at my face she could only see the left half, not the right half. When she looked down at her phone, some numbers on the right side of the screen seemed to be missing from her field of view. Additionally, she said she was having a hard time spelling easy words (ex. &#34;because&#34;) and was processing information really slowly when reading -- she noticed she was going much slower than normal.

                                                sore arm; little fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer via a Pfizer sponsored program. A contactable consumer reported for a 13-year-old female patient who received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 20May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included athletic induced asthma (she was diagnosed maybe 3 years ago, 2018 or maybe it was 2016) and horseshoe kidney (the patient was diagnosed with a horseshoe kidney a year or two ago, meaning when the patient was in the her mother&#39;s womb, her kidneys while they were developing never separated so she has to be careful not to get kidney infections and not to get hit in the stomach when she&#39;s playing sports). On 20May2021, the patient experienced sore arm, little fatigue. Caller (reporter) stated that there was a report that came out. Caller states her daughter got her first dose, she was 13, and had no reaction other than a sore arm and a little fatigue the first day. Caller states the reports says it&#39;s causing enlarged heart in a lot of teens; she asked her doctor about it and the doctor said the benefits of getting the vaccine outweigh the risks and advised the caller to still get it for her daughter. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Caller confirms the patient received the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. NDC: Unknown; Expiry Date: Unknown; Unknown Dosage; Indication: Caller states they are pretty good about not going anywhere, but they certainly venture out more than she does. Caller states she wants to make sure she was protected. Caller states she learned a day or two before she scheduled the shot that her daughter&#39;s school is not offering school from home next year. Caller states it&#39;s called E classroom, they are also doing hybrid but her daughter opted to stay home. Caller states she learned they weren&#39;t doing any of that next year.

                                                That afternoon, she was lethargic, achy and her arm was sore, so I gave her Tylenol. She had trouble sleeping that night. On Sunday morning, I gave her two Ibuprofen around 9 because her arm was still hurting. Around 9:30, she came in saying she was having chest pains and her pulse rate was over 120. I took her to the ER. Her heart rate was 128 when they triaged her. They gave her an IV and a saline drip, an EKG and chest x-ray, all of which were fine. Due to her being on birth control, they also did a d-dimer test, which was elevated at 442. They then did a lung scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Those results were negative as well. The chest pains resolved around 11 am. Since they ruled out the blood clot and nothing was found to be wrong with her heart, she was sent home. They figured that she maybe had an anxiety attack or heart palpations. I took her to her pediatrician the next day and she was cleared there as well.

She never gets nosebleeds, so I took her into the Dr. to have labs done, just to make sure her platelet count was good. All tests came back normal. We are on day 3 after her 2nd Pfizer, and she has not had a nosebleed yet today, so I&#39;m hopeful it&#39;s resolved. In addition to the nosebleed on day 2, she was exhausted, had a headache and had a low grade fever. These I expected, but not the nosebleeds.

She said her throat felt swollen.  A couple hours after a double dose of benadryl and ice packs she began to improve.   4th day she was much better. We spoke with her allergist over the phone, and he said it was reasonable to chalk the reaction up to extra stress on her body due to the vaccine/her bodies response to the vaccine.

                                                Patient said she felt immediate, strong pain in her arm from the jab the nurse gave her.  She said the needle was in her arm a lot longer than when she received her first shot.   I also watched patient receive her first COVID shot from a different provider, different facility, and I was surprised by the force of the jab of this second COVID shot, and length of time the needle was in her arm.  After the nurse left us in the room to wait 15 minutes, patient became more and more uncomfortable, hot, sweaty and nauseous.  Within 5 minutes, she was lying down on the exam table - at which time I alerted staff at the nurse&#39;s station in hallway that patient wasn&#39;t well and we needed help.  She said she would get &#34;the provider&#34; and be right in.  When I walked back into the room, patient was curled up in a ball on the table, pale, clammy and not able to speak.  I yelled down the hallway for help right away, and stepped back into the room.  Patient then began to vomit.  At least two nurses entered the room, and began to assess her vitals.  Her blood pressure was low, but she was breathing fine.  &#39;The provider&#34; (I don&#39;t know his name) came in and I told him about how hard she was jabbed, and that she began to feel badly immediately afterward.

                                                Patient is a 13-year-old who was transferred from another hospital for chest pain in the setting of Covid vaccination.   She received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, June 29.  On Wednesday she developed fatigue chest pain shortness of breath weakness, nausea and mild abdominal pain.  She also had a fever to 102.5 Fahrenheit.  mom is a nurse and took her pulse and felt that it was 30 and fast.  She then took 1 with her home equipment it was in the 120s.  She called her neighbor who took her pulse and it was in the 130s.  She then transferred her to another Hospital for further care at hospital her vital sinus evaluation was a temperature of 37.4 pulse 119 respiratory rate is 15 blood pressure 106/62 satting 98% on room air.  On exam she was well appearing with tenderness to palpation of sternum heart rate normal rate and rhythm lungs clear bilaterally and abdominal exam benign. they obtain CBC with white count of 4.8 hemoglobin 12.9 Camm that was unremarkable LFTs are within normal limits troponin that was negative BNP 223 with a normal upper limit of 125 ESR 2 D-dimer 0.697 with upper limit of normal 0.5 and a CRP of 9 with upper limit of normal of 8.1.  UA bland. She was given Toradol for chest pain EKG with sinus tachycardia .  She was given 1/2 L normal saline bolus ondansetron Toradol and started on maintenance IV fluids of D5 NS.  She was then transferred to another hospital for further care .    Upon arrival here she notes improvement in her energy level and all of her pain except for her chest pain.  She describes it as a pressure on top of her chest that is right in the center and is worse with movement and deep breaths.   Of note she had a appendectomy a few years ago that was complicated by surgeons making the bowel and then required her to have a bowel resection.  She has no dietary restrictions and eats by mouth, no GI complications in the long-term.     PMH: as above  PSH: No significant past surgical history  FH: Reviewed and noncontributory to current presentation  SH: Lives with caregivers   Meds: None  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Immunizations: UTD   Review of Systems       Constitutional:  fever, no chills, no sweats,  fatigue Skin: no rash, no lesions,  Eye: no redness ENMT: no ear pain, no sore throat, no congestion, no hoarseness  Respiratory: &#43; shortness of breath, no cough, no wheezing  Cardiovascular: &#43; chest pain, no palpitations,  Gastrointestinal: &#43; nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no GI bleeding  Genitourinary: no dysuria, no hematuria,  Musculoskeletal:  &#43; muscle pain,  Neurologic: no headache, no dizziness, no numbness, no weakness  Psychiatric: no sleeping problems,  Allergy/Immunologic: no recurrent infections,  Additional ROS info: All other systems of a 10 system review are negative.  Briefly, patient is presenting with chest pain, myalgias, and fever in setting of recent covid vaccine (2nd dose Pfizer 2 days ago).  Seen at an outside hospital where labs were notable for mildly elevated BNP and D-dimer, negative troponin, normal LFTs and chemistries.  Chest x-ray reportedly negative.  EKG with T wave inversions in V1 through V4 (read as nonspecific ST changes by their physician), but otherwise normal.  Given the possibility of post Covid vaccine myocarditis or PE, transferred for further management.  Patient states that after Toradol that she received the outside hospital all of her other symptoms have resolved but she continues to have chest pain.     My exam showed: Gen: tired but nontoxic appearing, no acute distress, alert and active; HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Chest: significant reproducible chest pain; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion, brisk radial pulses bilaterally; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: no rashes     Chest pain. Overall well appearing with normal exam with reproducible tenderness.  Given recent Covid vaccine, must consider myocarditis, although only mildly elevated BNP and negative troponin at the outside hospital are reassuring, especially given reproducible pain and reassuring EKG.  Symptoms then may represent musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or myositis related to vaccination.  Less likely pneumonia or pneumothorax, but possible.  Low suspicion for PE given lack of persistent tachycardia (tachycardia improved while in ED, currently HR 80s) or hypoxia. EKG obtained which showed T wave inversions in V1-V4 (normal for age).  Bedside ultrasound with normal global function and lack of pericardial effusion.  Labs obtained in BCH ED notable for negative BNP and troponin, along with reassuring lipase given abdominal pain.  Thus, unlikely to be true myocarditis, more likely musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or chest wall pain.  Cardiology will discuss with mom for reassurance.  Final Diagnosis  1. Chest pain R07.9 2. Fever R50.9 3. Fatigue R53.83 4. Shortness of breath R06.00  PLEASE NOTE:  Since the patient is not from here, we do not have access to her vaccination records and cannot supply lot number, etc.

On 6/13/2021, she developed vaginal mucositis prompting hospital admission for evaluation and pain management. She was originally discharged with supportive care (Tylenol/ Motrin for pain) and if needed triamcinolone 0.1% cream. Per chart check, she was seen by PCP six days later and had not yet started triamcinolone cream and still in pain. PCP prescribed topical clobetasol, and oral prednisone 20mg BID for 5 days based on dermatology recommendations for treatment of Lipshutz ulcers.

We laid her on the floor and elevated her legs, then she started feeling better. The paramedics came. BP was 90/48. when they left her BP was 101/60. Her parents decided to take her home for observation. I called them at 7:58pm and mom said she was perfectly fine. Vaccine given at 4:55, paramedics left at 5:20.

                                                My daughter got an intractable headache the Tuesday after getting the vaccine.  The headache was not treatable through normal pain relievers such as Tylenol and Ibuprofen.  The pediatrician told us to take her to the ER.  At the ER, they tested her for intercranial hypertension, as she had no history of migraines in the past.  The tests turned out negative.  They tried the normal migraine cocktail, Depakote, Decadron and magnesium.  None of the typical treatments worked to relieve the headache.  She was admitted to the hospital.  She had a neurology consultation, which didn&#39;t show any neurological issues.  The doctor also did an MRI.   The MRI didn&#39;t show anything abnormal.  The doctor started her on DHE (dihydroergotamine).  The medication began to help relieve the headache.  My daughter could not tolerate 0.5mg DHE, so the doctor gave her 2 more 0.4mg DHE treatments which eventually brought the headache down to a pain level of 0.

                                                Around 7PM on June 19th, she had chest pain and chest pressure. She also had a mild headache. She was taking a walk in the neighborhood and had to come home because she was experiencing shortness of breath and having difficulty breathing. She described it as an electric shock/shooting pain in her chest area, on both sides. I took her (the participant) to the ER. While at the ER, she started to feel experience pain and tingling in her left thigh. It would feel better if her leg was elevated. The leg pain subsided by the 20th. On the 21st, she was taken back to the ER because the chest pain and shortness of breath was not subsiding. They did another EKG which showed no abnormalities. Blood work came back with the same indication of virus/inflammation. They gave her a pain med (not sure of the exact name, but it is used for patients after surgery) and an IV. Also given a prescription for 27ml of ibuprofen with Tylenol in between. Two days later, on the 23rd, she had an appointment with the pediatrician. The doctor checked muscle tone and listened to her chest. My daughter gets fatigued by going up a single flight of stairs. Doctor referred her to a pediatric cardiologist. Later that night of the 23rd, she began to get a tingling sensation in her left arm that went down to her hands and lightheadedness. She was not able to move and had to lay down. Being upright made the pressure in her chest worse and she had to take shallow breaths. I took her to the ER. They did a chest x-ray that showed no abnormalities. Referred her for an echo cardiogram on the 24th. She was doing better after that until July 5th, when the pressure and pain started getting worse again. I took her to the pediatrician again and they referred her to rheumatologist on the 11th of July. The rheumatologist prescribed a steroid medication to calm her immune system. She said her immune system was activated and was inflamed, which is why she was experiencing the shortness of breath and pain. She prescribed her colchicine and Aleve. Since she has started to take the meds, she is doing better but she is still experiencing pressure at a lesser level. The pain is the same level that feels like static shock.

                                                Patient was administered the first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine per protocol and was seated for observation post administration.  She became faint.  Pharmacy staff  broke an ammonia inhalant to help the patient recover.  She responded quickly, but did require additional whiffs later.  When questioned, she stated that she was having no difficulty breathing, swelling in throat,  and no obvious rash.  She was accompanied by her mother, who  declined emergency medical care/911 assistance.  The patient was not wearing constrictive clothing, so no adjustments were necessary, but she did recline further in the chair.  She was also provided with cool, wet, paper towels for her forehead and neck.  When she was feeling better, she had a few sips of water.  Although offered a motorized cart to leave the store, she left with both parents walking with no assistance.  On 5/20/21 we reached out to the family and spoke with her father.  The patient did have a minor  headache the evening of her vaccine administration, which has resolved.  She does have a sore arm, which is a common side effect of the vaccine,  Her father has reached out to her pediatrician to see whether she should get the second dose or not.  He has not yet received a response.

She didn&#39;t totally lose consciousness, but she was disoriented. These symptoms lasted a few minutes, then she felt fine.

She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

                                                On the outset: There is no proven link of the vaccine with what happened, but I am filling this just in case you see a pattern emerge: She was vaccinated (pfizer, 1st dose) on Saturday, May 15 2021. A couple of hours later she started experiencing mild symptoms (moderate headache, which we thought as a normal reaction). These persisted on and off  until Wednesday, May 19th, when patient started having swollen and painful glands at the back of her mouth. Long story short, after testing first for strep, followed by blood work, patient&#39;s blood test came back positive with mono on Monday, May 24. The reason for this report is that I have read that mRNA vaccines, great as they may be, may trigger a virus response for viruses that stay within a person - like shingles or herpes etc. The way I understand it, mono also stays with a person. Patient had never been diagnosed with mono before, but mono sometimes does not have symptoms. So, is it possible that she had mono sometime before the vaccine, and it got re-triggered  due to the vaccine? Again, just in case you see a pattern, I am just reporting if helpful. Patient also developed  a mono rash on Wednesday, May 26; treated with topical benadryl cream.

                                                She was not feeling well when she got up on Saturday morning. We went to the neighbors house and were outside for maybe 15 minutes (it was a warm day) when she passed out momentarily. We immediately got her some water and got her in the AC and she did fine since then. She did have mild finger swelling on the distal joint of both index fingers after the first injection on 5/14/2021(same lot #). We are not sure if the finger swelling was related to the vaccine. It started about 5 days after first vaccine.

                                                Patient reports cough and fever since 5/22. Was seen by pediatrician in clinic on 5/25, diagnosed with pneumonia and prescribed azithromycin. Parent reported compliance with medication but reported that patient started to have coughing fits and fever of 104 at home. This prompted ER evaluation and subsequently admitted to hospital for observation. During admission, patient was treated with IV Ceftriaxone x 3 days and PRN Mucinex for pneumonia. No oxygen requirements, so no further intervention was needed per MD.

EMS arrived at 3:37pm and performed follow up tests including HR and blood glucose in EMS vehicle to which mother states results were normal, but patient was again light headed due to sight of blood. Mother and patient declined ride to additional medical facility.

                                                Starting early morning  after vaccine, approximately 15 hours after vaccine, patient developed severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and tachycardia. Her fever was high throughout the day (often 102.8 even after Tylenol and Ibuprofen).  I am a physician and my husband is as well, we monitored her heart rate, oxygenation, temperature, and symptoms at home. We called her doctor and asked whether this could be myocarditis and whether we should go to the ER. She felt that we should just have her rest and monitor her vitals. I dosed her with two large doses of Ibuprofen (600 mg twice during the day), and by 6 pm on 6/4 her chest pain started to improve and her fever broke. The severe crushing chest pain lasted about 12 hours.

                                                Extreme weakness in her arms and legs; Really bad cough; painful in arms and legs; not been feeling well; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (Parent). A 14-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), Solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder on 23May2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. There were no concomitant medications. Family history was reported as none, they were basically a healthy family. Patient was not vaccinated within 4 weeks and no additional Vaccines administered on same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. On 23May2021, the patient experienced extreme weakness in her arms and legs, really bad cough, on an unspecified date in May2021, she had severe pain in her legs and on an unspecified date in 2021, she was not been feeling well. Patient&#39;s father called on behalf of his 14-year-old daughter who received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine about two weeks ago and had extreme weakness in arms and legs, 2 weeks ago, on Sunday 23May2021. She had not been to school since then, she went for a couple hours and then they send her back. His daughter also said that it had been painful but caller states that he does not know exactly what his daughter means by that, she said that her legs hurt her, that started probably 24May2021 or 25May2021 with the bad cough also and not been feeling well. Had all leveled out the past 10 days. Had blood work and the results came back Friday. Thought there was an outside chance based on the blood work that it was strep related. Her doctor had suggested that the parents call Pfizer to see if this type of reaction had been reported in her age group after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She never really had a fever. This started the day after the vaccine, and they are not sure if it was related to the vaccine or not. A couple of results were off. The Streptolysins were 468. The antinuclear antibodies were 1 to 160, which was off. Everything else was negative. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included antinuclear antibody: 1 to 160, streptococcus test: 468. Patient received therapeutic measure to treat adverse events, they tried Amoxicillin, which had no impact, they thought maybe it was just a virus. They also tried Tylenol and Advil, which also had no impact. Stated that the Amoxicillin was 875mg twice a day and that the Tylenol and Advil were from different packages lying around the house. Patient was scheduled for the second dose this coming Sunday but they were holding off until she was better. The outcome of events was unknown.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On sunday night, about 36 hours after vaccination, she started to have numbness of her lower jaw and tongue. She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

                                                vaccine was given at the local high school (not by her doctor, the physician who is placing this report with mother&#39;s information)  She told mother she did not feel right 10pm the night of the vaccination, felt hot and cold, sweating, could not sleep, rose up from bed at 4am to get a glass of water, mother heard a noise from kitchen, and found patient passed out on floor. She was out for 2minutes at the most Mother got her up and made her drink a lot of water.  She continued to feel bad. Temp was close to 102.  Around 5pm that evening she was feeling better.  So this report is because of a syncopal episode about 19 1/2 hours after the Covid Pfizer vaccine #2.

A contactable consumer (mother) reported that a 14-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Jun2021 (Batch/Lot number was reported as EW &#39;O or 0&#39; 186) at the age of 14-years-old as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. There were no concomitant medications. No family medical history of seizure. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unknown date at Arm Left for covid-19 immunisation. The reason for the transfer today (03Jun2021) was that her 14 year old daughter immediately after getting her second dose of the COVID vaccine started shaking, experiencing fever and fallen unconscious and collapsed and was taken to the hospital and she wanted to go ahead and report those adverse side effects for her. She (patient) was 14 year old and she got her second vaccination today and few minutes after she got it, she stood up and she said she was not feeling well and then the next thing reporter knew like her eyes go back, she do not seem conscious and she was shaking as if, looks like she was having a seizure and then she fell down and she was not conscious, so she fell down, she is still twitching. She has no history of like seizures but that is like twisting and now she was taken to the hospital. So, the hospital treated her as if she had a concussion. Reporter have reported to them that she looks like it was a seizure before she fell down, into her head. Reporter further stated &#34;That day was her second shot and like I said she stood up, she got up from that, she said that she got funny and that I can see where she just kind of lost consciousness, eyes going back, shaking as if she was having seizures and then she fell down and she was unconscious and she is like still moving as if she is having a seizure and she was taken. Reporter stated, &#34;it was a like a seizure but it is like over and she had concussion like falling on the ground but it appears like a seizure, that was a immediate thing.&#34; For treatment, reporter stated that &#34;Any treatment, No. She was taken to the hospital and the hospital needs to write it down and I don&#39;t understand that, the hospital wrote down concussion but the hospital they took the vital signs and she had low blood pressure.&#34; For the date when patient went to the hospital, reporter stated &#34;That was today, June 3rd and she is discharged.

After waiting 30 minutes, the mother (who was shopping) retrieved child who was sitting in the pharmacy waiting area post vaccination. After 5 more mins, another customer got the RPH attention explaining the patient was passing out. The mother assisted patient to the pharmacy waiting area, in which the patient was given chairs to sit on and put feet up. Another shopper who said she was an ER nurse told the pharmacy staff to have the patient lay down across the chairs then left. The patient was weak, cold, clammy, and pale. The patient then told the pharmacist that she had left her mother at the check out section, went upstairs, used the bathroom, was coming down the stairs when her vision started to have black spots. She reached her mother when she said she didn&#39;t feel good and started to pass out. The mother stated she caught her daughter. At this point, the RPH initiated a 911 call.  She called out for the technician to call the store managers for assistance and take over the 911 call. The RPh then stayed with the patient and the mother. The tech gave the mother a bottle of water for the pt. The store managers arrived at the scene and also assisted.  The patient stated she was feeling a lot better after she laid down for a little bit. The RPh notice color coming back into the patient&#39;s lips and face.  The patient stated that the adverse effects didn&#39;t start until she was walking down the stairs. After 10-15 mins, the Paramedics arrived and further assisted the patient and her mother. The paramedics took the patient via stretcher to the ambulance for further treatment around 12:55pm.

                                                6/19/21 patient awoke with non-bloody, bright green emesis and abdominal pain. She endorses several episodes of nonbloody diarrhea with continued abdominal pain.  She endorses starting her menstrual period 3 days ago. Mom endorses fever at this time, T-max 102.9.  Presented to an urgent care for further evaluation where they obtained a rapid strep test and COVID-19 swab that were both negative. 6/21/21 she presented to an ED for continued and worsening symptoms.  She received a dose of antibiotics and saline boluses during transfer to another hospital.  In route, she became hypotensive with minimal response to fluid resuscitation. She required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A CT of the abdomen showed nonspecific findings for enterocolitis.  A urinalysis had 5-15 RBCs and 51-100 WBCs. She was started on antibiotics. She required ICU admission initially, but improved and became hemodynamically stable after about 16 hours in the PICU. Her urine culture grew 3 different organisms with low colony counts so antibiotics were discontinued on 6/22/21. An ECHO demonstrated normal biventricular size and systolic function (LFEF 62%), mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating mildly elevated RV pressure (30-40% systemic), mild flow accelration across normal appearing trileaflet aortic valve and borderline small aortic root and sinotubular junction, normal ascending aorta, no pericardial effusion, normal right, left main, and LAD coronary artery diameter z-score, and mild outpouching in the left main coronary artery that may represent an early appearance of an aneurysm. A repeat ECHO the following day revealed normal biventricular size and systolic function, mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating RV systolic pressure of 30mmHg, left main coronary artery appears slightly prominent but measures within normal limits. LMCA measurement is similar to previous, normal measurement of the proximal RCA and LAD, and trivial pericardial effusion. The patient also had an elevated CRP of 18.8 mg/dL, fibrinogen of 408 mg/dL, d-dimer of 0.98, and nt-pro BNP of 309. SARS CoV2 IgG was positive and IgM was negative. She received IVIG 100 gm on 6/23/21 and was started on rivaroxaban. CRP decreased to 8.2 mg/dL on 6/23/21.

                                                Within 2 hours of the vaccine, patient was experiencing nausea and general feeling of unwellness. Within 3 hours, patient had a fever of 99.9. At 11 pm, patient had a fever of 100. Mother administered Tylenol and patient went to bed. Patient woke up around 4:30 am with her whole body shaking uncontrollably. Mother heard her stirring and went to check on her. Her temperature was 100. Mother sat and talked with her and offered a snack, drink, and more Tylenol. Mother checked her pulse, which was normal. Patient was coherent and able to communicate. Mother left the room to get snack and drink and heard something fall over in patient&#39;s room and Mother called out and waited a few seconds for a response. Patient did not respond. Mother went back in the room, as it was unusual for patient not to respond, and found patient sitting back up and placing her head in her hands, stating in a panicked voice that she felt she was going to throw up and that she was very hot and that her head hurt really bad. Patient stated that her ears felt weird and everything went black and she somehow fell over from a sitting position on her bed to laying on her bed and had landed on the dog. Patient was unaware that she had knocked over her water bottle and had no recollection of the loud sound it made as it fell over (unusual because loud sounds are very startling for her). The shaking subsided to a tremor a few minutes after the black out. Patient then reported feeling very cold and her temperature had risen to 101. Patient complained of an extreme headache and continued nausea. Mother took patient to Urgent Care, who performed bloodwork and an EKG, and then referred patient to the Emergency Room for an EEG.  ER repeated EKG and declined to do EEG and told patient to follow up with her doctor in 5 - 7 days.

                                                Experienced lump formed in middle to base of throat and right cheek became swollen. Lump in throat was the size of a quarter but did not block her airway passage. Doctor checked her airway passage, heart, and pulse. Took one Zyrtec administered by mom, because she is allergic to Benadryl. The Zyrtec was given around 2:45 PM. After 10 minutes the lump in middle to base of her throat and right cheek did not reduce in size. She was able to drink water and her mom,  and gave her another Zyrtec pill. This is an emergency plan for provided by her allergy doctor. This was an emergency event for her with all of her known allergies. After 20 minutes, she began to feel the lump in her throat slowly decrease in size. She was being monitored by Dr. and a Nurse, and additional nurses on staff. Dr. continued to check her heart, airway passage, and pulse. As the lump continued to reduce in size after 45 minutes to 1 hour after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, she was able to get up and walk around with a pulse monitor on her finger to monitor her heart rate and breathing. She did not have any concerns while walking nor while sitting in the office and was being watched by the staff. In the very beginning after giving her the Zyrtec she need to keep her mask off to ensure her breathing stayed under control. We were able to leave  and did not need the EpiPen administered by staff nor by her mother. We were able to leave around 3:45PM. We received follow up calls from the Nurse at 4:54 PM and from Dr. around 5:30 PM to check on her. At 11:00 PM I did give her 1 Zyrtec before bed. I woke her up on June 17th at 6:15 AM and asked her to drink some water. After drinking water she noticed she had a lump in her throat. Her mom gave her another Zyrtec. She was watched closely  throughout the remaining week and was in contact with her doctors office. Patient also experienced pain in her throat due to all the swelling/inflammation. Since receiving the vaccine, patient has noticed an increased difficulty in wearing her mask. This did occur prior to receiving the vaccine.

She was originally misdiagnosed as having poison ivy and was given 2 steroid shots. That helped for a few days. She then saw the regular Dr who said it was a virus and was given 5 days f oral steroids.  The rash has persisted coming and going regularly in different locations all over the body. My daughter has also been much more tired than normal.  The regular Dr has referred her to dermatology but she can?t get in to be seen for several weeks.

                                                I gave patient 0.3ml of an undiluted vial of vaccine. Later on, about an hour I realized what I had done and called the Pfizer help line. They gave me a little information. I called the patients mom to let her know what had happened. I had talked to several other sources besides Pfizer about what to expect and informed mom of increased arm soreness and fever and feeling bad.  I called the mom back the next day to see how she was doing and she had run fever that night and bad soreness in the arm. Mom said she was doing ok, nothing out of the ordinary.  I also reported it through our compliance dept.

Given the above history, physical exam and ancillary tests, the patient&#39;s symptoms are most consistent with:  Acute myopericarditis.  Should be noted the patient is post 2nd COVID 19 vaccine by  3 days ago.

Because this is highly likely a post vaccination myopericarditis will hold on aspirin or other treatments at this time.  Patient was given Motrin 400 mg p.o. in the ED for pain.

Our Dr. is confident this is related to the vaccine. She was a perfectly healthy 14 yr. old girl and been sick ever since she got the vaccine. It is not a coincidence. The vaccine made her sick and we deserve answers. The reporter believe in vaccines and wanted to do the right thing to get the numbers down. Had the reporter known this would have been her body&#39;s response, reporter never would have had her get vaccinated. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan for her lungs: unknown results on unknown date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events and the treatment included antibiotics. The events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.

There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

                                                After administration of vaccine the patient stood up quickly and passed out.  The patient fell down and came to rather quickly.  After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

Afterwards, pt reported headache, dizziness, and sore throat immediately after the shot. Pt was hyperventilating so I encouraged deep breathing and hydration. HEENT and Pulm exam were normal, as were the vitals. Pt eventually recovered without any other intervention. Pt waited for full 30 minutes after dose.

Patients father remained at her side, patients father administered two puffs of patients inhaler, Albuterol, for the coughing.   Nurses attended at patients side, checked vitals which were stable with oxygen saturation of 100% and however, pulse noted to be elevated in the 130&#39;s.  RN auscultated lung sounds, no wheezing noted, but pt exhibiting signs of anxiousness as well now.  Pt assisted to wheelchair and to area to lie down for further evaluation.  Pt was lain on her right side, RN remained at her side entire time.  Pt advised to use inhaler again, two pufffs, and encouraged to slow her breathing, relax, and was advised that her vitals were stable.  Pt was asked if she felt she needed additional support with her breathing and she stated yes.  911 was called and advised of the situation.  Pts pulse did lower to 100-105 and breathing did become easier and more regular while we waited for EMS to arrive.  Pt transferred to care of EMS with oxygen saturation of 100% and pulse of 104.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

                                                Vaccine was administered.  The mom made a comment that her daughter has a tendency to pass out after vaccines after administering the vaccine to the patient.  We kept the patient in the counseling room seated for observation to be on the safe side.  Within 5 minutes, the patient got light headed and stated she didn&#39;t fell well.  She passed out.  We laid her down for about 10-15 minutes and gave her some candy since she stated she hadn&#39;t eaten all day.   Pt regained consciousness and was fine after.

Within 2 minutes in of her observation period, she started fainting and having seizure like for about 10 seconds, and regained conscious and said she felt dizzy and then blacked out. She was pale and sweating and asked for water. Our shift lead happened to be closed by her chair where she was sitting so she prevented pt from falling down from the chair and called pharmacist for help from inside the pharmacy. Pharmacist rushed to the patient and asked shift lead to call 911. Pt was consious, but lethargic, she could breath normally, no sign of obtruction airway. Pharmacist lift her legs up to opposite chair and started to take BP. Paramedic arrived within minutes and took her vitals which was normal. Mom agreed for paramedic took her out in stretcher to hospital for check up.

Mom was with her--patient was coherent and speaking to me.  She said her head hurt--I told her I&#39;d get an ice pack, which I did and gave to her.  Mom was really worried so I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, which I did.  2 EMTs came and checked the patient out.  Mom wanted her to go get checked out at the hospital so the patient and Mom went with the EMTs.  I called Mom around 8:00pm 5/28/2021 and she said pt was checked out.  The hospital doctor said it was a vaso-vagal reaction and released patient home with no restrictions.

A 15-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s daughter) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in May2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included few immunity issues which were currently being treated. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient has a few immunity issues which we are currently treating. Patient had her first vaccine last week, it left her with migraines, a slight fever with severe fatigue on an unspecified date in 2021. Reporter was concerned that the second would be more harsh. Please advise on your research if think that we should proceed or wait. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On 5/30/21, patient woke up around 10.30 am and complained of severe headache in back of head (pain level 8-9/10). She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

On 6/5, she complained about chest congestion in the morning. She described that it felt like running after a mile. I asked her to drink more water and get some rest. The discomfort didn&#39;t get away, so I consulted her pediatrician over the phone. Her pulse and blood pressure were normal (86/103/75). She didn&#39;t feel short of breath. And her finger oximeter result was 99.  In the afternoon, she described the discomfort as after some strenuous exercise and kept putting her hand over her heart. She felt tired and didn&#39;t have a good appetite for lunch or dinner, and only ate half meals. After dinner, around 9:30, she throws up and felt a little better.  Then she took a capsule of Motrin liquid gel of 200 mg ibuprofen and went to bed. She slept well and felt OK this morning.

A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23May2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to amoxicillin where it was a couple of times when she was little and she would get blotches and red; and has been vaping without her parents knowing. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON). On 23May2021, the patient experienced breathing reaction. The mother stated that her daughter took the vaccine, she was 15, she was aware of the normal side effect problems and heart problems as she has been hearing in the news, she was concerned because she just figured out her daughter has been vaping without her parents knowing. The mother stated that she was a family therapist, and many teens vape age 12-15, parents don&#39;t have a clue about vaping and the chemicals in the vape that can cause heart and lung problems. She was contacting Pfizer because she wants to make sure this was in the radar, because of side effects. They should consider asking these types of things prior to administering the product. The mother was concerned watching her daughters breathing reaction. Her daughter was better today. The mother was reading side effects on vaping and there was some link to heart and lung issues, some even have lead in the chemicals or nicotine. The mother stated that she has also realized, in general when people ask if they are taking medications, especially for women they don&#39;t say anything about taking pills, or combination of pills. Her daughter experienced a Breathing reaction after the first dose. She was better today, she took the shot on Sunday, she was tired and coughing on an unspecified date but was better now. Her main concern was the age group and the Heart problems for this group. Her First Dose was on 23May2021, she was worse yesterday but today she was better. The breathing reaction started on the 23rd. Yesterday her daughter was in bed all day. Her daughter has made no physician office visit or went to the emergency room because of this. Treatment: Not to her knowledge, Unknown for breathing reaction. The mother again stated that she just wanted to express he concerns with this age group. The patient was recovering from all events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient got her 2nd Pfizer Covid-19 shot at 5:45 PM on Tues 6/8. She had some of the typical side effects the next day- a sore arm, flu-like body aches, a headache and fatigue. In the middle of the night Wed night/Thurs morning at 3AM she woke up with chest pain and difficulty breathing. In her words, her &#34;heart really hurts and it is hurts to breath.&#34; I gave her 1 (500 mg ) capsule of Tylenol. This was the first pain reliever she had received post shot. She also applied Frankincense oil over her heart. Patient was unable to go back to sleep for a few hours because it hurt too much. She did finally fall back asleep in the early morning hours. Yesterday (Thursday 6/10) she reported that she was feeling a lot better. Her heart was still a little painful but by today, Friday 6/11, she says she feels fine.  When I heard on the news about a number of other children between 12-15 who reported heart pain, I thought we should let you all know. I am a little worried that there might be some kind of long term complication for her heart.

Around 6:30pm she came outside to get some fresh air, trying to feel normal &amp; got suddenly dizzy &amp; then fainted. Her body kind of, rocked. She came to, after she heard her sister, calling her name a few times. So she was out for less than a minute. But she&#39;s never fainted before!

On the fifth day she complained  that she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe so I took her to the ER. She was diagnosed with an Allergic reaction because her throat was swollen and she was prescribed some Prednisone. They gave her Benadryl and Steroids. It has been nine days and it seems to be a little better but her throat still hurts and she is very tired.

The second shot caused a fever of 102.5 for about 12 hours and tiredness the next day as well as throwing her into a worse flare where she had liquid stools at least 4 days with visible blood two days after the vaccination. We are still dealing with the flare, so I do not know how long it will last or if she will need steroids to get her back into remission.

She said her throat felt tight and like it was closing and she could not take a deep breath. I told the patient to take sips of water but she said that wasn&#39;t helping.  Her throat still felt very tight and she couldn&#39;t breathe. I gave the patient 1 benadryl 25mg capsule. I continued to ask her to sip water and take deep breaths. After about 10-15 minutes she said she still felt like someone was choking her. I gave her another 25mg benadryl. The entire time the patient&#39;s mother was present and consented to provide Benadryl. After 10 more minutes, the patient said she still did not feel well, but did not want an Epi-Pen.  Another pharmacist called WellNow (in our parking lot) and they said the patient could go there to be monitored. WellNow said the patient was just tired and they did not administer any further medication.

                                                Dizziness/lightheadedness; Nausea; Blurred vision; Terrible headache; a little palpitation; Clogged throat; this heaviness (not clarified); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent). A 15-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included no other illness. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously received Amoxicillin, Azithromicin, Cefdinir, Gardasil(Pf) and had allergy. The patient had Nausea that does not go away with Gardasil. She also received HPV vaccine previously and experienced nausea and the dizziness for a month. Reporter stated, &#34;she did not have any allergic &#39;condition&#39; (not clear) but she was allergic, she had always had a rash when she had this Amoxicillin this antibiotic. She was allergic to Penicillin.&#34; The patient had the COVID Pfizer Vaccine on 15May2021 and as soon as she had her first dose she started to feel nausea and dizziness and from there 5 days later she had, she felt a terrible headache, &#39;this heaviness&#39; (not clarified), headache, dizziness, palpitation. The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine. She just wanted to call the Medical Department if she should have the vaccine on Saturday or not.

Charge nurse hooked up patient to the pulse oximetry and called 911 at approx. 10:34 am. The patient?s O2 level was 83 with a pulse of 107. The charge nurse observed that the patient was under a lot of stress and was hyperventilating and unable to verbalize how she was feeling. Shortly after, the patient fainted due to hyperventilation. Observation nurse advised the patient to calm down and take deep breaths but the patient did not comply and continued rapid breathing. The patient started to vomit and made some gurgling sounds in her mouth and the charge nurse with the help of site specialist laid the patient on her left side. Shortly after, the patient stopped breathing.   Observation nurse administered the epi-pen on the patient?s right thigh. Immediately after administering the epi-pen, patient started to breathe again with an O2 level of 98 with a pulse of 110; but the patient was still unconscious and unresponsive. At approx. 10:36 am first responder paramedics arrived at the scene and took the patient to hospital for further evaluation.

This case pertains to patient 3 of 3. A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727; Expiry Date: 31Jul2021), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jun2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. On 17Jun2021, after 15 minutes of observation, the patient had a severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness and stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. On an unspecified date, the patient also had nausea and vomiting. The patient pulse ox (documented as provided by caller) went down to 83%, she had severe headache, nausea, vomiting and she was unconscious. When she was unconscious was when her pulse ox was 83% and she stopped breathing intermittently for 10 to 12 seconds at a time. Then she started breathing again but was not responsive after she received the epinephrine then her pulse ox steadily rose again but was not responsive. She was like this until EMS took her away. The reporter stated that the most severe case was for this particular patient. She had already been vaccinated and had already gone through the 15 minute observation. All these kids came in a bus together, but this patient was sitting in the vehicle after the observation when the guardian brought her back to the nurses saying that she was complaining of a severe headache and at that point she had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness. The nurses reported that it appeared that she stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. At that time they administered epi (epinephrine) and called EMS. Her pulse ox and her breathing improved after the administration of epi, however she remained unresponsive when she was on the way to the hospital with EMS. The patient was taken to the hospital and she did improve. This was the 2nd dose, she had the 1st dose and did not have a reaction to it. The seriousness of the events severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as medically significant. The reporter stated that it was very serious. This patient reaction was a little more intense than just an anxiety induced reaction. She says with a pulse ox of 83% if they had not intervened then this would of been life threatening. It is medically significant but if they had not intervened then it would have been life threatening especially when you&#39;re talking about gurgling and a pulse ox of 83%. The reporter tends to think that with that severe of a reaction, with the pulse ox that low and her being unresponsive, she believes that this was probably a true adverse event. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  The reported causality for the events severe headache, had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as related.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, dyspnea and headache and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Client received dose 1 of the COVID19 Pfizer vaccine (Lot# EW0187 Exp 08/31/21) at 13:32 from RN1.  RN1 reported that within 5 seconds of receiving the vaccine, the client reported she felt dizzy and experienced a syncopal episode for 2-3 seconds.  As the syncopal episode was occurring, ancillary staff, requested RN2 radio for a Lead Nurse &amp; EMT.  At 13:34 Lead RN arrived at station 6, radioed for an EMT, and observed client sitting up in the vaccination chair being held by her mother and RN1.  Lead RN noted client?s head was down with her eyes open, exhibiting pallor and was diaphoretic.  Lead RN asked client her name and how she was feeling.  Client did not respond.  Co-Lead RN entered the room at 13:35. RN1, Lead RN, Co-Lead RN, and client?s mother guided client to the floor, laid her in a supine position, lifting her legs and feet on a chair.  Co-Lead RN removed client?s mask, continued to ask client her name.  Within 2-3 seconds of repositioning client, she became responsive and alert &amp; oriented to person, place, time, and event.  Client also immediately stated, ?I?m fine.?  EMT1, EMT2, and EMT3 came to the station at 13:36 with a zero-gravity chair.  The EMTs assisted client into the zero-gravity chair.  Client?s mother stated client has no underlying health conditions, no allergies, and that birth control is the only medication the client takes.  The client confirmed this by nodding her head in agreeance.  EMT2 gave client a bottle of water and the client immediately started drinking the water.  Lead RN asked client if she had eaten or drank anything today.  Client?s mother stated she did not realize her daughter had not eaten or drank anything prior to coming to get vaccinated.  Client stated she was given a granola bar downstairs at check-in and ate it before receiving the vaccine.  At 13:45 EMT1 took vitals.  Both EMT1 &amp; EMT2 were unable to obtain client?s blood pressure (HR:61, O2Sat:  97%).  Lead RN asked client and her mother what the client?s normal blood pressure is.  Client and her mother did not know, and client?s mother indicated that the client is an athlete in good shape.  At 13:48, EMT3 took client?s blood pressure, which was 100/60.  Client?s mother stated client was anxious about being vaccinated and has fainted when anxious in the past, but the last time was around 5 years ago.  Client stated she was feeling better and no longer feeling dizzy.  Client stated she just ?feels hot.?  Lead RN brought client an ice pack to put behind her neck and damp paper towels to wipe her face with.  At 13:59 EMT3 took client?s vitals (BP:  118/70, HR: 65, O2Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color was returning to her face and client was less diaphoretic.  Client finished her bottled water and was given another by EMT2, which she started drinking.  Lead RN asked client if she felt she could stand up.  Client stood up and stated she was ?feeling fine.?  At 14:05 all 3 EMTs escorted client and her mother to the observation room where she was monitored for an additional 30 minutes.  At 14:30 Lead RN went to the observation room where EMT1was taking client?s vitals (BP:  110/70, HR: 60, SPO2 Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color had fully returned, and client was no longer diaphoretic.  Client stated she ?felt fine? and was hungry.  Client?s mother stated she would take client to get something to eat and EMT2 gave client an additional snack that client took with her when she left.  Client and her mother left at 14:30. Client was walking with a steady gait when she exited the building.

She did not lose consciousness at any point but was very clammy, sweaty and lethargic and feeling very weak and faint. We called 911 right away and EMS came and took her vitals which they reported as normal but took her to the ER to be evaluated.  After speaking with mother that evening and the next day she reported it took her &#34; a while&#34; to feel better at the ER and the ER noted her blood sugar was also low.  They ran some other tests but nothing else was remarkable according to mother. By the next day when we spoke 7/11 patient was feeling much better and back to normal according to mother.

I went back to the drug usage report to verify and called patient this morning but call went to voicemail. The COVID vacc was appropriately recon, dosed, timed and administered by my immunization certified technician. The paperwork errror is that I put the name on the &#34;EVENT REPORTING SYSTEM&#34; as this patient not other patient. Please make the correction accordingly.

Elevated heart rate gradually beginning to be noticeable and bothersome with a feeling of being &#34;winded&#34;.  This also was totally out of character for my daughter who is a runner.   She has never had any symptoms like this before.

                                                Around 9 AM, my daughter came downstairs and said her legs felt heavy. She sat down and then she said she was really hot. She was also sweating and pale. She said that she felt like she was about to pass out and that she couldn&#39;t see. She also said she couldn&#39;t focus, that she was seeing stars, and everything looked black. My husband and I told her to lay down on the couch. We gave her a rag to put on her head to cool her down and we got her some water to drink. She said she had a headache and we gave her some Tylenol.

We gave her water and after a few minutes she started feeling better but we called 911 anyway.  When they came her blood pressure was 80/54 and they gave her IV fluids right away and decided to take her to the ER for observation.
