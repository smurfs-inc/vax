After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

Afterwards, pt reported headache, dizziness, and sore throat immediately after the shot. Pt was hyperventilating so I encouraged deep breathing and hydration. HEENT and Pulm exam were normal, as were the vitals. Pt eventually recovered without any other intervention. Pt waited for full 30 minutes after dose.
