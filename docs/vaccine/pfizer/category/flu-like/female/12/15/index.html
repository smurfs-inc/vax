                                                My daughter is experiencing periodically nose bleeds, brain fog and bit distracted and losing herself in her thoughts after her first dose  Pfizer vaccine. This is new from the initial report. Her mother also states she feels fatigue and not active for a few days now.  At this time I have not been able to get an appointment to see her doctor and I am very concerned about her symptoms.   I would like more research or documentation to be released about this type of group to figure out why this happened to her. Also, I would like to see if they are going to be monitored after her vaccine. I do not know what other side effects will be coming after her vaccine and I am concerned.

                                                Client received her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine (lot # EW0185 exp. 08/2021) at 11:28 AM. The client was brought to the EMT station by lead RN stating that the client was feeling &#34;dizzy? at 11:46 AM. The client was a 12-year-old female alert and tracking with her eyes and appeared anxious. The client had a chief complaint of lightheadedness. The client stated that she ?began to feel lightheaded? after her initial 15-minute observation had completed. This was the client&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine and she stated reluctance to receive her first dose. The client denied any allergies and her parents stated that the client had a history of unspecified behavioral disturbances that require her to see a therapist. The assessment revealed no hives, swelling, discoloration, shortness of breath, or other signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. The client denied a headache or wanting to throw up. The client refused to have her vitals taken by EMTbut agreed at 1150 to remain lying down until she felt better. The client was encouraged to drink water while she waited. After 15 minutes and drinking a bottle of water, the client stated &#34;I feel all better&#34; but &#34;I think I&#39;m overthinking this&#34; and stated that she was now experiencing a ?headache?. RN asked the client?s parents? permission to speak to the client. RN came over to reassess the client and that client finally agreed to have her vitals taken at 1208: 148/84 blood pressure, Pulse 94, 100% O2 on room air, Respirations 16, alert and oriented to person, place, date, and event. The client revealed to RN that she was experiencing anxiety from her vaccination but became much calmer after discussing her concerns further. Client also revealed that she engages in acts of self-harm but has no intent to end her life. The client&#39;s last set of vitals at 1216 were 128/76 BP, HR 96, O2 100%, Resp. 16. The client then stated that she was ?ready to go? after her last set of vitals. Lead RN asked to speak to client?s mother in private. Lead RN provided mother with crisis hotline. Mother informed lead RN that client was in therapy and already seeking help. The client&#39;s parents were instructed to seek emergency care if a significant allergic reaction occurred later in the evening and were provided with all relevant vaccine-related information by RN. The client departed at 1220 in a positive disposition with her parents.

                                                It was within 5 minutes, she started having hives that went down her arm and spread to other arm, face, trunk, legs, stomach. I went and got a nurse and she called a pediatric team - three nurses and one doctor - they took her vitals and gave her some Benadryl - 30 ML (children&#39;s). They had her sit and drink a bottle of water. We watched to see if the swelling and the hives would shrink and go away. It was probably about 20 minutes later where they went away, but she developed a headache and she was nauseated. We administered Benadryl (gave her regular 25 mg tablet every 6 hours)  for the next 24 hors in the dosage times. She was nauseated the first day and she had headache for two days. The hives went away by the time she went to bed the evening of the vaccine.

                                                Within 3-5 minutes, she was asking for water and feeling hot.  Her back was sweaty. Her eyes looked like they were glazed- not responding; didn&#39;t look bright. She got some water and an ice pack on her back and removed her shoes and put her feet up. After drinking the water and keeping the ice pack on for the rest of those 15 minutes. Nurses were there watching her. And she was able to walk out of the clinic on her own power. It had looked like she maybe would have passed out without the intervention of water, ice pack and getting her feet up.  She had muscle pain in her arm (of injection site)  that day and into the next day. The muscle pain in her arm lasted for about 24 hours.

About 3:20 - her right arm and a little bit on her left arm were almost like hives (bumps) - they were a little bit itchy off and on. The next morning, could still the bumps but not as bad, but on 19th after school it was back just like the day before. We gave Benadryl to see if that would help. In the morning it goes away - on her arms, she can see a little a bit of where the lumps are - not as bad; on legs it&#39;s just almost completely gone, and by afternoon it&#39;s back to full scale of where it had been the night before.  Could see where the bumps were in her arm but it is  not as bad as it was. Today, as far as I know from the last time I asked her, she said there are still some on her arms but not on legs.

I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

                                                did well acted right, felt right up until 5 AM this morning (6/4/21), she woke up throwing up over and over again, she couldn?t keep even a dissolvable Zofran down.  &gt; I immediately contacted her Hematologist and he told me to take her to the E.R.   &gt;  blood disorder, ?Hereditary Spherocytosis? came to life, flared up.  &gt;got extremely sick, where she could not walk or stand by 8:00 am this morning, when we arrived at the E.R. she had to be placed in a wheelchair because she was so weak.  &gt; Fluids, Pain medicine, Motrin, and nausea medication were given, plus rotating cool rags on her head to get her body temperature down.  &gt;  CBC, was off the charts, she has developed Anemia and was diagnosed this morning. &gt;  blood pressure dropped to 91/42.  &gt; I spoke with two hematologist on top of speaking with the 2 E.R. Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

In a.m., she was at 100 degrees. She started shaking and fainted when getting ready to go downstairs; Pulsometer - 147 for heart rate. She shook just a little. I thought she was going to have a seizure and I yelled for my husband and she regained consciousness. She hasn&#39;t had a fever since but we can&#39;t keep her heart rate down -it shoots up from 130- to low 150&#39;s. Still like that today. we took her to Dr. - he said it was reaction to vaccine. He referred her to cardiologist with an urgent designation. She&#39;s never had nay problems like this before. She will see cardiologist tomorrow. Rest and hydration is the current treatment. It hasn&#39;t gone away in the two or three days that they thought it would.

                                                My daughter presented with a fever of 101.9 and complaints of chest tightness about 24 hours after her 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She also was coughing a very shallow, tight cough that was triggered by trying to take a deep breath. She rated the chest tightness a 7/10. By bedtime, fever down to 100.1 without any medication. Gave one ibuprofen for chest tightness. The next morning she was feeling much better and said she could barely feel chest tightness. As day progressed and over next several days, the symptom would come back, but was mild. Pediatrician saw her on 6/4 - no abnormal findings. Due to lingering , though mild symptoms over weekend, pediatrician made referral for cardiologist. Cardiologist performed EKG on 6/9 and results normal.

                                                Patients is a 13 year old girl who came into facility to receive her Pfizer vaccine. She was nervous upon receiving her vaccine and after the shot was administered she stated she feels a little warm. The vaccinating pharmacist told her to sit and wait in the sitting area for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. A couple minutes after her vaccine was administered the girl started not feeling well and fainted in the store and her father caught her. We immediately called 911 and checked in with the young girl. The ambulance came and did a physical exam. They offered to take her to the hospital but the patient declined. Patient left the store shortly after with her father.

                                                The day after my daughter received her vaccine, she began to feel congested and tired. This was on Sunday, May 23. We got up for school on Monday, May 24, but she was complaining about a really bad sore throat. The school nurse called and I picked her up from school because she was also getting more congested. She began to cough and sneeze constantly and took a long nap. When she woke, she was saying that she was getting short of breath and it felt like her heart was racing, even though she was just sitting. The next day her throat felt better, but the congestion was the same - still coughing and sneezing but her shortness of breath started getting more obvious. I emailed her pediatrician to ask about bringing her in, and they said to report this to the CDC and bring her if if she&#39;s not better in the next few days. Today is Wednesday, May 26 and she is still congested, short of breath and overall feels lousy. She is coughing up lots of mucus - greenish and thick. Yuck. I just gave her one pill of a mucus reducer to see if that would help. My biggest worry is about the shortness of breath because that is exactly what I experienced after my first dose of the vaccine. Mine was Moderna and I have seen dr&#39;s about it - and actually ended up in the hospital, but they do not believe it to be connected to the vaccine. I will contact them and let them know about my daughter&#39;s shortness of breath and perhaps they will think differently. Oh, she&#39;s had a slight fever of 99 F on occasions during this.

Went to the Doctor and she said it looked like an allergic rash. She told us that based on my daughter&#39;s genetics and her asthma -  (I (her mother) had an anaphylaxis with my second Moderna shot  - my entire body was giant hives.)- That he did not recommend her to have the 2nd shot. My daughter still has some of the rash - a little on her left cheek, stomach and back still. The itching is gone. She did take Benadryl for it.

                                                On 05-22-2021, participant&#39;s mother states her daughter pain started at about 1:00AM. I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

Then, on Thursday, May 27th she had a swollen and painful armpit on the arm that the injection was in.  The pediatrician thought it was probably swollen lymph nodes, but just did a teleconference with her, so she didn&#39;t see the swollen armpit. Patient took ibuprofen for the pain and swelling, put heat compresses on it occasionally, but it still stayed that way for All of Thursday and through the weekend.  The swelling began to go down on Monday, May 31.  Then on the morning of June 1 she had a sore throat, later developing a fever, headache, and congestion that lasted two days.  She is a bit improved today, June 3rd, just still congested and has a cough but all other symptoms are gone.

                                                About 5 minutes following immunization, parent came to alert pharmacist that patient was experiencing nausea and light-headedness. Pharmacist observed that patient had a drowsy appearance and her eyes would periodically roll to the back of her head. Patient was also warm to the touch. She was given a cold pack which we placed on her wrists and she said that seemed to help. Patient remained under observation for about 20 minutes before she felt comfortable to leave the store.

So I went out with my daughter at 3:00 p.m. She and stood in line at clothing store after walking for an hour and a half and then suddenly she felt dizziness and 20 seconds later she lost consciousness. And then she woke up a minutes later while an employee called 911. She was fine and felt well but when we came back to our house, she was tired and slept 15 minute in my car. The next day, my daughter was fine, but after dinner we walk out near my house after 10 minutes she felt dizziness again.  She sat there for 10 minutes and she was fine. After that day, there were no symptoms.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

She wasn&#39;t talking much, she started gagging and fainted again and her body started convulsing.  We believe she was having a seizure.  Patient has never had a seizure, her fever was high.  It only lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  When she stopped, she was able to walk with assistance back to her room.  We quickly gave her some medicine to bring down her fever.  Wet wash cloth and a fan on her.  I failed to take her temperature.  I was too concerned at what was going on.

The headache (and fatigue) continued Monday and Tuesday as well. But by that Tuesday afternoon 6/8, she was complaining that her vision was impaired.  She couldn&#39;t see things out of the right corner of her right eye. Example, when she looked at my face she could only see the left half, not the right half. When she looked down at her phone, some numbers on the right side of the screen seemed to be missing from her field of view. Additionally, she said she was having a hard time spelling easy words (ex. &#34;because&#34;) and was processing information really slowly when reading -- she noticed she was going much slower than normal.

Medical history included athletic induced asthma (she was diagnosed maybe 3 years ago, 2018 or maybe it was 2016) and horseshoe kidney (the patient was diagnosed with a horseshoe kidney a year or two ago, meaning when the patient was in the her mother&#39;s womb, her kidneys while they were developing never separated so she has to be careful not to get kidney infections and not to get hit in the stomach when she&#39;s playing sports).

The outcome of the events was unknown.   Pfizer Covid Vaccine: Caller confirms the patient received the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. NDC: Unknown; Expiry Date: Unknown; Unknown Dosage; Indication: Caller states they are pretty good about not going anywhere, but they certainly venture out more than she does. Caller states she wants to make sure she was protected. Caller states she learned a day or two before she scheduled the shot that her daughter&#39;s school is not offering school from home next year. Caller states it&#39;s called E classroom, they are also doing hybrid but her daughter opted to stay home. Caller states she learned they weren&#39;t doing any of that next year. Caller confirms her daughter is scheduled for her second dose on 10Jun2021. PSCC Communication: Report 2 of 7. Caller does not provide any further information on patient; therefore, no further information obtained or verified.  Additional information has been requested.

                                                That afternoon, she was lethargic, achy and her arm was sore, so I gave her Tylenol. She had trouble sleeping that night. On Sunday morning, I gave her two Ibuprofen around 9 because her arm was still hurting. Around 9:30, she came in saying she was having chest pains and her pulse rate was over 120. I took her to the ER. Her heart rate was 128 when they triaged her. They gave her an IV and a saline drip, an EKG and chest x-ray, all of which were fine. Due to her being on birth control, they also did a d-dimer test, which was elevated at 442. They then did a lung scan to rule out a pulmonary embolism. Those results were negative as well. The chest pains resolved around 11 am. Since they ruled out the blood clot and nothing was found to be wrong with her heart, she was sent home. They figured that she maybe had an anxiety attack or heart palpations. I took her to her pediatrician the next day and she was cleared there as well.

                                                Patient was administered the first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine per protocol and was seated for observation post administration.  She became faint.  Pharmacy staff  broke an ammonia inhalant to help the patient recover.  She responded quickly, but did require additional whiffs later.  When questioned, she stated that she was having no difficulty breathing, swelling in throat,  and no obvious rash.  She was accompanied by her mother, who  declined emergency medical care/911 assistance.  The patient was not wearing constrictive clothing, so no adjustments were necessary, but she did recline further in the chair.  She was also provided with cool, wet, paper towels for her forehead and neck.  When she was feeling better, she had a few sips of water.  Although offered a motorized cart to leave the store, she left with both parents walking with no assistance.  On 5/20/21 we reached out to the family and spoke with her father.  The patient did have a minor  headache the evening of her vaccine administration, which has resolved.  She does have a sore arm, which is a common side effect of the vaccine,  Her father has reached out to her pediatrician to see whether she should get the second dose or not.  He has not yet received a response.

She was standing in our kitchen at home and became dizzy and started falling backwards. She said her vision was black, she was hot, her head hurt, I could see sweat on her face and chest, and she said she was having tightness in her chest/not able to get full breaths. She didn&#39;t totally lose consciousness, but she was disoriented. These symptoms lasted a few minutes, then she felt fine.

She then alternated between feeling hot and cold and seeing &#34;blurry spots&#34;. I noticed her lips turning white and she said she needed to lie down. I got her water and ice packs since she was sweating. We sat on the floor for about 10 minutes, then she was able to move to a chair for another 5-10minutes and then left the facility. Mom reports that she has been lethargic and napping most of the day. Patient ate a few cheez-its for breakfast and reports that she did not get a good nights sleep last night.

                                                On the outset: There is no proven link of the vaccine with what happened, but I am filling this just in case you see a pattern emerge: She was vaccinated (pfizer, 1st dose) on Saturday, May 15 2021. A couple of hours later she started experiencing mild symptoms (moderate headache, which we thought as a normal reaction). These persisted on and off  until Wednesday, May 19th, when patient started having swollen and painful glands at the back of her mouth. Long story short, after testing first for strep, followed by blood work, patient&#39;s blood test came back positive with mono on Monday, May 24. The reason for this report is that I have read that mRNA vaccines, great as they may be, may trigger a virus response for viruses that stay within a person - like shingles or herpes etc. The way I understand it, mono also stays with a person. Patient had never been diagnosed with mono before, but mono sometimes does not have symptoms. So, is it possible that she had mono sometime before the vaccine, and it got re-triggered  due to the vaccine? Again, just in case you see a pattern, I am just reporting if helpful. Patient also developed  a mono rash on Wednesday, May 26; treated with topical benadryl cream.

We went to the neighbors house and were outside for maybe 15 minutes (it was a warm day) when she passed out momentarily. We immediately got her some water and got her in the AC and she did fine since then. She did have mild finger swelling on the distal joint of both index fingers after the first injection on 5/14/2021(same lot #). We are not sure if the finger swelling was related to the vaccine. It started about 5 days after first vaccine.

She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

Afterwards, pt reported headache, dizziness, and sore throat immediately after the shot. Pt was hyperventilating so I encouraged deep breathing and hydration. HEENT and Pulm exam were normal, as were the vitals. Pt eventually recovered without any other intervention. Pt waited for full 30 minutes after dose.

Patients father remained at her side, patients father administered two puffs of patients inhaler, Albuterol, for the coughing.   Nurses attended at patients side, checked vitals which were stable with oxygen saturation of 100% and however, pulse noted to be elevated in the 130&#39;s.  RN auscultated lung sounds, no wheezing noted, but pt exhibiting signs of anxiousness as well now.  Pt assisted to wheelchair and to area to lie down for further evaluation.  Pt was lain on her right side, RN remained at her side entire time.  Pt advised to use inhaler again, two pufffs, and encouraged to slow her breathing, relax, and was advised that her vitals were stable.  Pt was asked if she felt she needed additional support with her breathing and she stated yes.  911 was called and advised of the situation.  Pts pulse did lower to 100-105 and breathing did become easier and more regular while we waited for EMS to arrive.  Pt transferred to care of EMS with oxygen saturation of 100% and pulse of 104.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

The mom made a comment that her daughter has a tendency to pass out after vaccines after administering the vaccine to the patient.  We kept the patient in the counseling room seated for observation to be on the safe side.  Within 5 minutes, the patient got light headed and stated she didn&#39;t fell well.  She passed out.  We laid her down for about 10-15 minutes and gave her some candy since she stated she hadn&#39;t eaten all day.   Pt regained consciousness and was fine after.

Our shift lead happened to be closed by her chair where she was sitting so she prevented pt from falling down from the chair and called pharmacist for help from inside the pharmacy. Pharmacist rushed to the patient and asked shift lead to call 911. Pt was consious, but lethargic, she could breath normally, no sign of obtruction airway. Pharmacist lift her legs up to opposite chair and started to take BP. Paramedic arrived within minutes and took her vitals which was normal. Mom agreed for paramedic took her out in stretcher to hospital for check up.

Mom was with her--patient was coherent and speaking to me.  She said her head hurt--I told her I&#39;d get an ice pack, which I did and gave to her.  Mom was really worried so I asked her if she wanted me to call 911, which I did.  2 EMTs came and checked the patient out.  Mom wanted her to go get checked out at the hospital so the patient and Mom went with the EMTs.  I called Mom around 8:00pm 5/28/2021 and she said pt was checked out.  The hospital doctor said it was a vaso-vagal reaction and released patient home with no restrictions.

                                                On 5/30/21, patient woke up around 10.30 am and complained of severe headache in back of head (pain level 8-9/10). She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

A 15-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s daughter) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in May2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included few immunity issues which were currently being treated. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that patient has a few immunity issues which we are currently treating.

On 6/5, she complained about chest congestion in the morning. She described that it felt like running after a mile. I asked her to drink more water and get some rest. The discomfort didn&#39;t get away, so I consulted her pediatrician over the phone. Her pulse and blood pressure were normal (86/103/75). She didn&#39;t feel short of breath. And her finger oximeter result was 99.  In the afternoon, she described the discomfort as after some strenuous exercise and kept putting her hand over her heart. She felt tired and didn&#39;t have a good appetite for lunch or dinner, and only ate half meals. After dinner, around 9:30, she throws up and felt a little better.  Then she took a capsule of Motrin liquid gel of 200 mg ibuprofen and went to bed. She slept well and felt OK this morning.
