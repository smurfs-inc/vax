This consumer (mother) reported for a 12-year-old female patient (daughter) that. A 12-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0185),via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 18May2021 17:00 as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 18May2021 the patient experienced clear fluid was accompanied with some blood thereafter, some of the vaccine leaked out of her arm, some of the vaccine leaked out of her arm and held the needle too long at the arm. Caller called for her 12 year old daughter who received her 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yesterday at 5:00pm MST at a Pharmacy. She mentioned that 5 out of 6 of them in the family were over 16 years old and had no problem with their vaccination as they received it at a different Pharmacy branch. She mentioned that the branch she went to yesterday for her daughter was very unorganized. The vaccination was held at a drive-thru in which she noticed that the Pharmacy Technician held the syringe too long on her daughters arm and when he pulled out, some clear fluid flowed out and ran down her arm and she started bleeding. She already went up to the Pharmacist and they mentioned that they will call Pfizer within the week. She is called for herself just to make sure and seeked recommendations for events such as these because she is doubtful that her daughter even got enough of the 1st shot. She is wondered if she should restart the dose, how long should she wait if she restarts, or just proceed with the 2nd dose. Consumer called about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who reports her 12 year old daughter supposedly received her first dose yesterday at a pharmacy at 05:00PM MST. Agent reports that caller also mentioned that 5 people in their family above the age of 16 received doses at another pharmacy and had no problems, but her daughter who took her first dose yesterday at a drive thru of a pharmacy had a problem. Agent reported caller said that yesterday the tech who administered the first dose held the needle too long at the arm and when they pulled it out some of the vaccine went out, some clear fluid leaked out of her daughter&#39;s arm, and was accompanied with some blood thereafter. Agent reported that caller was advised to consult their physician and let them know Pfizer Medical Information&#39;s number so they can contact and discuss options. Caller said she would say that she was not very far from her daughter&#39;s arm when it happened since she was sitting next to her. She said she saw a fat drop of clear liquid run down her daughter&#39;s arm, and then after that came down, after it came a drop of blood that leaked down into it, so that it was clear at first then became pinkish. She said the person who gave the injection to her daughter had to grab something to wipe it because it was traveling down her arm. Caller said that there was no treatment done to her daughter&#39;s arm other than when he wiped it off and slapped a band aid on it, and then he didn&#39;t make eye contact with her and didn&#39;t want to talk about it. She understood that things like this can and do happen sometimes. She said she should have taken her daughter to a doctor but she didn&#39;t. Said her daughter did not have any other vaccinations yesterday or any other vaccinations in the last four weeks. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

She was evaluated in emergency room and found to have markedly elevated CPK to &gt;7000 and mildly elevated AST (195) and ALT (70),  and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and admitted to hospital where she was treated with IV fluids. Her CPK peaked at 11,400. She improved on IV fluids and was discharged home on 6/16.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.

                                                6/19/21 patient awoke with non-bloody, bright green emesis and abdominal pain. She endorses several episodes of nonbloody diarrhea with continued abdominal pain.  She endorses starting her menstrual period 3 days ago. Mom endorses fever at this time, T-max 102.9.  Presented to an urgent care for further evaluation where they obtained a rapid strep test and COVID-19 swab that were both negative. 6/21/21 she presented to an ED for continued and worsening symptoms.  She received a dose of antibiotics and saline boluses during transfer to another hospital.  In route, she became hypotensive with minimal response to fluid resuscitation. She required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A CT of the abdomen showed nonspecific findings for enterocolitis.  A urinalysis had 5-15 RBCs and 51-100 WBCs. She was started on antibiotics. She required ICU admission initially, but improved and became hemodynamically stable after about 16 hours in the PICU. Her urine culture grew 3 different organisms with low colony counts so antibiotics were discontinued on 6/22/21. An ECHO demonstrated normal biventricular size and systolic function (LFEF 62%), mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating mildly elevated RV pressure (30-40% systemic), mild flow accelration across normal appearing trileaflet aortic valve and borderline small aortic root and sinotubular junction, normal ascending aorta, no pericardial effusion, normal right, left main, and LAD coronary artery diameter z-score, and mild outpouching in the left main coronary artery that may represent an early appearance of an aneurysm. A repeat ECHO the following day revealed normal biventricular size and systolic function, mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating RV systolic pressure of 30mmHg, left main coronary artery appears slightly prominent but measures within normal limits. LMCA measurement is similar to previous, normal measurement of the proximal RCA and LAD, and trivial pericardial effusion. The patient also had an elevated CRP of 18.8 mg/dL, fibrinogen of 408 mg/dL, d-dimer of 0.98, and nt-pro BNP of 309. SARS CoV2 IgG was positive and IgM was negative. She received IVIG 100 gm on 6/23/21 and was started on rivaroxaban. CRP decreased to 8.2 mg/dL on 6/23/21.

This case pertains to patient 3 of 3. A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727; Expiry Date: 31Jul2021), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jun2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. On 17Jun2021, after 15 minutes of observation, the patient had a severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness and stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. On an unspecified date, the patient also had nausea and vomiting. The patient pulse ox (documented as provided by caller) went down to 83%, she had severe headache, nausea, vomiting and she was unconscious. When she was unconscious was when her pulse ox was 83% and she stopped breathing intermittently for 10 to 12 seconds at a time. Then she started breathing again but was not responsive after she received the epinephrine then her pulse ox steadily rose again but was not responsive. She was like this until EMS took her away. The reporter stated that the most severe case was for this particular patient. She had already been vaccinated and had already gone through the 15 minute observation. All these kids came in a bus together, but this patient was sitting in the vehicle after the observation when the guardian brought her back to the nurses saying that she was complaining of a severe headache and at that point she had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness. The nurses reported that it appeared that she stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. At that time they administered epi (epinephrine) and called EMS. Her pulse ox and her breathing improved after the administration of epi, however she remained unresponsive when she was on the way to the hospital with EMS. The patient was taken to the hospital and she did improve. This was the 2nd dose, she had the 1st dose and did not have a reaction to it. The seriousness of the events severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as medically significant. The reporter stated that it was very serious. This patient reaction was a little more intense than just an anxiety induced reaction. She says with a pulse ox of 83% if they had not intervened then this would of been life threatening. It is medically significant but if they had not intervened then it would have been life threatening especially when you&#39;re talking about gurgling and a pulse ox of 83%. The reporter tends to think that with that severe of a reaction, with the pulse ox that low and her being unresponsive, she believes that this was probably a true adverse event. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  The reported causality for the events severe headache, had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as related.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, dyspnea and headache and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 15-year-old female (non-pregnant) patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (lot#EW0196) on 30May2021 11:00 AM, vaccine location=Left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history was Asthma. No any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), paracetamol (TYLENOL) as needed. It was 4 days early and was the worse period she has experienced in 3 years. She was bleeding excessively and extreme cramps on 02Jun2021. We thought maybe it was a coincidence. She is only 15 yrs old and has had her period for 3 years and has never experienced anything like what she has in the last month. She is due for her next period on 29Jun2021 and I pray it was not as bad as last month after the shot. Outcome of reaction/event at the time of last observation was unknown. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.   No follow up attempts needed. No further information is expected.

This involved increasingly heavy bleeding, with large blood clots. My daughter became very pale, weak on the morning of Mon, June 28, she fainted, then vomited. Made dr appt and got bloodwork. Started her on iron supplements. Dr said the hemoglobin was at 10.6, but had us get blood checked 3 more times, lowest hemoglobin was at 7.3.
