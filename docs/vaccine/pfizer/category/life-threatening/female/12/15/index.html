This consumer (mother) reported for a 12-year-old female patient (daughter) that. A 12-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0185),via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 18May2021 17:00 as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization.

On 18May2021 the patient experienced clear fluid was accompanied with some blood thereafter, some of the vaccine leaked out of her arm, some of the vaccine leaked out of her arm and held the needle too long at the arm. Caller called for her 12 year old daughter who received her 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine yesterday at 5:00pm MST at a Pharmacy. She mentioned that 5 out of 6 of them in the family were over 16 years old and had no problem with their vaccination as they received it at a different Pharmacy branch. She mentioned that the branch she went to yesterday for her daughter was very unorganized. The vaccination was held at a drive-thru in which she noticed that the Pharmacy Technician held the syringe too long on her daughters arm and when he pulled out, some clear fluid flowed out and ran down her arm and she started bleeding. She already went up to the Pharmacist and they mentioned that they will call Pfizer within the week. She is called for herself just to make sure and seeked recommendations for events such as these because she is doubtful that her daughter even got enough of the 1st shot. She is wondered if she should restart the dose, how long should she wait if she restarts, or just proceed with the 2nd dose. Consumer called about Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine who reports her 12 year old daughter supposedly received her first dose yesterday at a pharmacy at 05:00PM MST. Agent reports that caller also mentioned that 5 people in their family above the age of 16 received doses at another pharmacy and had no problems, but her daughter who took her first dose yesterday at a drive thru of a pharmacy had a problem. Agent reported caller said that yesterday the tech who administered the first dose held the needle too long at the arm and when they pulled it out some of the vaccine went out, some clear fluid leaked out of her daughter&#39;s arm, and was accompanied with some blood thereafter. Agent reported that caller was advised to consult their physician and let them know Pfizer Medical Information&#39;s number so they can contact and discuss options. Caller said she would say that she was not very far from her daughter&#39;s arm when it happened since she was sitting next to her. She said she saw a fat drop of clear liquid run down her daughter&#39;s arm, and then after that came down, after it came a drop of blood that leaked down into it, so that it was clear at first then became pinkish. She said the person who gave the injection to her daughter had to grab something to wipe it because it was traveling down her arm. Caller said that there was no treatment done to her daughter&#39;s arm other than when he wiped it off and slapped a band aid on it, and then he didn&#39;t make eye contact with her and didn&#39;t want to talk about it. She understood that things like this can and do happen sometimes. She said she should have taken her daughter to a doctor but she didn&#39;t. Said her daughter did not have any other vaccinations yesterday or any other vaccinations in the last four weeks. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

When they would touch her hips, toes, spine, ankles, and knees she would complain of extreme pain, like joint pain. Her daughter had numbness from waist down. If they touched her foot she could not feel it. Her daughter was admitted to the hospital and got released yesterday 23May2021. She is still experiencing pain and numbness. The numbness is from the waist down and the tingling was up and down her arms. She said that her daughter was very weak and could not feed herself. They had to give her several albuterol breathing treatments in the hospital because her chest was tight. She was not wheezing, but they could tell it was constricted and treated her with Albuterol.  She said that her daughter still cannot walk without assistance this morning. She was treated with Motrin, Benadryl and Atarax, and Prednisone in the hospital. The caller said that her daughter also complained about itching all over and in her throat. The caller said that her daughter did not have a rash though.

I wiped the area 2 times times and applied pressure for ~1 minutes. Applied a cotton ball under a band-aid. Within 1 min of the vaccine, the pt developed a pump that appeared to be filled with blood under the surface. She stated that the site felt like &#34;when you initially get poked with a needle&#34;. I recommended to take ibuprofen 200-400mg q4-6 hours until the swelling decreases, to apply a cold compress, and call md if worsens.
