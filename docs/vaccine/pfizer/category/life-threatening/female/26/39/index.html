                                                The day after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, the patient began to experience heavier than normal menstrual blood loss and blood clots. The patient returned in 21 days and received her 2nd dose of the vaccine and began to experience heavy clots and blood loss again along with headaches, paleness, and weakness. The patient saw a physician and was given medroxyprogesterone to decrease the bleeding on 4/15/2021. On 4/28/2021 the patient reported to an ER and was given a transfusion due to low iron levels.

I want to document my experience as I had some pretty severe reactions to my second dose.   Evening of the 26th I got chills and a fever of 102.9F. I took one ibuprofen and the fever went away.   The next morning I had a slight headache. Around noon I got intense chest pains/pressure that lasted 30 minutes. I could not take a full breath as it was very painful.    On the 28th, I woke up with a terrible headache for no apparent reason. Some ibuprofen helped. After a few hours it was gone.   At 2am on the 29th, I woke up with very intense stomach cramps. I went to the bathroom and was able to pass out some stool over the course of about 30 minutes in the bathroom, and the cramps went away.   On May 31st, I got what seemed to be a blood clot in my left index finger. It went away after about 20 minutes but still felt sore the rest of the day.

I have not had regular spotting before and I went to an OBGYN on 5/12 and there were no abnormalities that would indicate another cause of the bleeding. It&#39;s not serious but I&#39;m reporting in the hope that your studies begin including effects on things like menstrual cycle because it sounds like there are effects like this happening.The adverse event result Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information expected.

She presented to hospital on 5/22 with a lacy rash over the entire body and a change in her voice with a sensation that she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was given several doses of epinephrine, and steroids and improved, and was admitted to medicine for observation.  She reported getting initially COVID-19 vaccine dose on 4/19/21. Thereafter had lacy rash over entire body for 3 days which she took as needed benadryl with improvement. After her second dose on 5/10/21 she initially had no symptoms. Approximately 6-7 days after her second dose lacy whole-body rash returned, worse than when she initially had it after first vaccine dose. She took benadryl several times but rash worsened. She had an odd sensation in her throat and noticed a change in the tone of her voice, and felt like she was having difficulty breathing. She presented to the emergency department.

A 27-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8736) in left arm via an unknown route of administration on 24Apr2021 at 10:10 (at the age 27-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727) right arm, via an unknown route of administration on 31Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization and experienced no adverse event. On 14May2021 at around 07:00 or 08:00, the patient experienced stroke. The patient was hospitalized for stroke from 15May2021 to May2021. On an unknown date, the patient had blood clots on her brain, headache, her left leg was numb like it was asleep, blurry vision. It was reported that patient was recently got her vision back to where she can stand the light long enough to do the research and call around. The stroke happened on 14May2021 and patient went to the hospital on 15May2021 for 5 days because she thought it was just a headache. The patient cannot find the exact date she was discharged. The vision was the first thing that went, then headache started. When patient woke up early in the morning her left leg was numb like it was asleep. Patient used the restroom and did her morning routine, and when she sat back down had the worst headache of her life. They said she had blood clots on her brain. When patient got there, they couldn&#39;t stop it because it had already happened and the damage was done. It was reported that patient knew she was going to be travelling and would start working around children. Patient was exposed to a lot of people and thought at the time it was the best thing to go ahead and get the vaccine to go back to a new normal. Patient had bloodwork test and drew so much blood trying to figure out how but results showed unknown. The most common stroke was a blood clot on the brain. Everything matches from the blurry vision to the headaches. Patient declines to report on any of the people she read about, she is just calling to report on herself. The stroke was early because her aunt had a stroke literally the week before and her wake was in the morning. She was getting ready for that. The patient had no other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccines. Patient&#39;s lab test included blood work: unknown on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was unknown.  PSCC Communication was as provided contact information for Pfizer Legal Department and report reference number to the caller. Caller declined to complete reports on the people she read about online.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional Information has been requested.

                                                I was sitting down eating lunch at work when I had an onset of heart palpatations. I work at a hospital so my coworker called a code and the rapid response team hooked me up to a monitor and they said it looked like I was in afib. I have a history of SVT but I had an ablation in 2014 and have not had palpatations since until February 15th. 2 weeks after my 2nd COVID vaccine. Not sure if this is related, but I?ve been seeing on the news that there have been heart issues in young adults linked to the vaccine.

Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

Epinephrine was administered immediately. Patient began breathing normally after a few minutes. The whole event lasted about 5 minutes. Patient disclosed afterwards she had a fear of needles. This did not look like a panic attack, it appeared to be a true anaphylactic response.

My last period was on December 8th and I received the vaccine on Dec 30th. I developed a fever and muscle aches after the first dose, but was managed with Tylenol.  I received the second dose on January 22nd and again developed a fever that was managed by Tylenol. I began having vaginal bleeding on 24th. I had an ultrasound revealing a heartbeat on the 25th. After continually bleeding, another ultrasound a week later on Feb. 2nd confirmed a miscarriage. I&#39;ve had two healthy pregnancies prior to this one.

Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

I have been spotting (1 pad daily) because of my birth control, but now I?m using 6-7 pads a day and soaking through them. I?m not sure if it?s related but I?m also extremely fatigued and having chills.  Should I ask for a blood test for my platelet count?  I?ve read it is a very rare reaction for some to have lower counts.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 05Mar2021 08:00 as a single dose (at the age of 28-years-old) for Covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included epilepsy, hypopituitarism, central diabetes insipidus, neoplasm of brain, irregular menses, short-term memory loss, elevated LDL, and myopia w/ astigmatism. The patient had known allergies to surgical tape and contrast dyes. Concomitant medications included desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), lamotrigine (LAMICTAL), levetiracetam, and zonisamide; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug allergy. On 08Mar2021 at 06:15 PM, the patient experienced generalized tonic-clonic seizure, feeling unwell, slightly nauseous, still a little slow in speech and gait. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of generalized tonic-clonic seizure, feeling unwell, slightly nauseous, still a little slow in speech and gait as Nayzilam 5 mg two doses was administered. Clinical course details as reported: the patient finished dinner and evening medications before 6 pm and started feeling unwell and slightly nauseous soon after. Laid on sofa, started to sit up at 6:20 pm, and went into a Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure. The patient&#39;s father administered Nayzilam 5 mg (2 doses); seizure ended and the patient went into a deep sleep until 8:00 pm. The patient was largely recovered, but still a little slow in speech and gait. The outcome of the events was recovering as reported.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 12Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7534) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included corneal abrasion and pain in my calf, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included tetryzoline hydrochloride (EYE DROPS [TETRYZOLINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced DVT in her right calf on an unspecified date and &#39;felt pain in my calf between 10-20 hours before second vaccine dose. the pain went away but came back 5 hours after second vaccine dose. in the next 10 hours, the pain became severe and constant&#39; on 02Apr2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient felt pain in her calf between 10-20 hours before second vaccine dose. The pain went away but came back 5 hours after second vaccine dose. In the next 10 hours, the pain became severe and constant. At 40 hours after second vaccine dose, she went to the ER and was diagnosed with a DVT in her right calf. The adverse events result in Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of both events which included blood thinners. The outcome of the events was recovering.

On March 25 or March 26 (I cannot remember exactly which day here) I started spotting, and then by the next day I was bleeding. On March 29 I saw my OBGYN who diagnosed me with a miscarriage. I continued to bleed for approximately 10 days, as well as dizziness, and feeling very faint. I have had 2 very healthy pregnancies in the past and no health issues. This could be absolutely unrelated, as early miscarriages are almost impossible to pinpoint, but I did feel this should be reported for researching purposes.

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection and Lot Number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 at 13:45 (at the age of 28-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Workplace Clinic. Medical history included ulcerative colitis, hyperthyroidism, hypertension and known allergies: Cephalexen and NSAIDS. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks and received other medications (unspecified) in two weeks. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 24Mar2021 at 14:00, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction - throat and tongue swelling, which resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Epi pen (administered 15 minutes after injection of vaccine), benadryl, ER trip, fluids and headache medication as a treatment for the event. The patient recovered with lasting effects. The outcome of the event was recovered with sequel.

                                                PE; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse. A 28-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: Ek9231), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 28 years, on 12Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, angiolipoma, labral surgery to hip, drug hypersensitivity to penicillins; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE 1/20) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]); both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, bactrium ds and experienced drug hypersensitivity, doxycycline and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient received first dose of COVID vaccine BNT162B2 (lot number= Ej1685) at the age of 28 years on 22Dec2020 on the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that 2 weeks after the second vaccine, she underwent hip labral surgery and suffered a PE on 22Feb2021. She was not sure if the vaccine could have contributed to the PE or just the surgery but wanted to report just incase. She was taking aspirin to prevent DVT&#39;s. The patient was hospitalized for pe (pulmonary embolism) for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures (DOAC) were taken as a result of pe (pulmonary embolism). The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event pulmonary embolism is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Patient&#39;s hip surgery two weeks after the vaccine might have contributed to the event onset.

                                                Within 7 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started what I thought was my second period of the month. I had just finished a period 12 days earlier. I am usually 35 - 42 days between periods so this was VERY unusual for me. I had my normal period pre-vaccine Jan 4 - 9 then 7 hours after the vaccine started bleeding again from the 21-25 of January. Then again on Feb 4 - 9. I got my second vaccine while bleeding. Then again started to bleed on Feb 21 - 25. I had a doctors appointment at the end of February. I got an annual gyno exam as well as a ton of bloodwork was taken to check everything out. I was told to continue to monitor the bleeding and if it didn&#39;t stop we would do a pelvic ultrasound. Well, it didn&#39;t stop so we did and it came back normal. I had a mostly normal March with light bleeding. I thought perhaps it was getting better but no. I have had two periods in April. In fact still bleeding on round two and this is my 6th day bleeding. Periods or irregular bleeding was April 12-17 and then again on April 24 - 29 (still happening and it&#39;s the 29th). This is very scary to me as no doctors can help.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information Requested on Lot/ Batch number.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported faint was most likely due to an accident, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Upon receiving my first shot, I felt weak, and after a few days a tingly feeling in my head. Symptoms lasted for 2 weeks. After receiving the second dose, I had a fever that evening and weakness, it lasted through the next day. My right arm was sore for 2 days.  I took Advil, Tylenol, and ibuprofen (at different times). Symptoms of fever lasted two days and were gone, I was left feeling weak, it lasted for a day.  Now day 5 after I got my shot (got the last dose 1/22/2021), I have noticed some vaginal bleeding that has been going on for 2 days now (It&#39;s not the menstrual period since I had that going on a week before I got my last shot). I am wondering if there are any other women who have experienced the same reaction to their body. Kindly feel free to call me or email me with any answers. I am trying to reach my primary physician who is currently booked till February.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

                                                Patient is a 29 yo F with PMHx of psoriasis who presented for dose #1 of Pfizer vaccine, she received her vaccine without issues and was being monitored for 15 minutes as recommended. Within her first 10 minutes of being monitored patient notified the staff that she felt warm, within one minute from her complaint of feeling warm she had a full general tonic clonic seizure in her chair for about 15 seconds with associated diaphoresis and thready pulse. Seizure activity broke spontaneously and pt was AO x 3. 911 was called immediately, she was transferred to our medical observation area for further monitoring and examination.   Her initial vitals after seizure activity T: 97.5, HR 69, BP 130/77, 02: 98%, BS within first 10 minutes of monitor without food/water was 134.    Exam: GEN: AO x 3 HENT: nc/at, anicteric sclera, EOMI CV: regular, nl s1, s2, no mrg PULM: clear bilaterally NEURO: grossly intact SKIN: clammy   Upon further questioning pt states she had a similar response while in college to Yellow Fever vaccine but never had an evaluation. She has had vasovagal events with other vaccines and blood draws. She denies any neurological history other than seizure like activity with Yellow Fever vaccine.    She states she had an aura with tunnel vision and feeling warm similar to when she had Yellow Fever vaccine.   She denied any nausea, she was alert and oriented x 3 after resolution of seizure activity. She was transported to ED for further evaluation. Report was provided to  at ED.  Seen by Neuro on 4/23/21: Interim History: Patient is a 30 yr, right-handed woman with no significant medical history who is referred for evaluation of an episode of LOC.   The episode occurred on 4/9/2021,10 minutes after receiving the 1st dose of the COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine. She reports feeing anxious after receiving the dose because of the history of having passed out after receiving vaccines. As with the previous events, she felt &#34;hot and clammy&#34; and had tunnel vision before losing consciousness for approximately 15 seconds.  She was told that she &#34;shook all over&#34; for a few second. Upon regaining consciousness, she was oriented almost immediately and was not confused. The episode occurred while sitting.    Patient reports a history of at least 5 syncopal events, since age 12 yr, with 4 of these occurring while sitting and 2 while standing. All of the evens have occurred either after receiving vaccines in 2016 or undergoing medical procedures. Two of the events also include shaking movements but none have been associated with tongue biting, urinary incontinence or post event confusion.    She also reports a  history of episodes of lightheadedness with postural changes but denies palpitations, CP or SOB.  She has never had a neurological or cardiac evaluation.    There is a history of a mild concussion while playing soccer. There is no history of CNS infections, febrile seizures or family history of neurological disease.

She has a history of similar episodes occurring after vaccinations or medical procedures. She reports episodes of pre-syncope and postural lightheadedness. She does not have risk factors for epilepsy and the episodes have an atypical duration for convulsive seizures.   In my opinion, the recent event is not an allergic reaction to the vaccine and there is no contraindication for receiving the 2nd dose.    Plan: I suggested taking lorazepam 1 mg prior to getting the 2nd dose of the COVID vaccine and to consider consultation with a cardiologist at some future time (but not required prior to obtaining the 2nd dose).   I did not recommend an EEG or brain MRI scan.   Follow-up will be on a PRN bases.

Medical history was not reported. She took a lot of medications, antidepressants and antianxiety meds, states she told the facility where she got the vaccine about these. Until now, she said she is still experiencing dizziness, waves of nausea, tiredness, and chills. She said she feels hot and cold a lot. Last night (14Apr2021), she said she had cramps similar to that of menstrual cramps. She said she has not had cramps ever since she started being on an Intrauterine Device (IUD) and birth control. Consumer also said that she experienced Vaginal bleeding last night (14Apr2021), when she is not even scheduled to have her menstruation yet. She wants to know if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine, and if it is normal that she is still having the symptoms even after almost 7 days since receiving the vaccine. Caller states she gets dizzy a lot, waves of nausea, and felt like she had a fever, hot flashes or cold a lot. Had to call out of work on the weekend. Last night was really weird for her, was having cramps, like menstrual cramps, has an IUD and takes birth control and went to the bathroom and she was bleeding, even if she was supposed to have her period it wouldn&#39;t be the time she was supposed to be having it, called her Gynocologist to let them know. Dizziness gets worse during the day, nausea comes in waves, tries to sleep through the day, the more she sleeps the better she feels. Does not know if this is an allergic reaction. Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient was found unresponsive at home on 5/22, admitted to another institution, found to be in DKA, multisystem organ failure (renal failure, liver failure), new R femoral DVT, elevation of ferritin, LDH and CRP.  Over the course, platelet count continues to drop while on anticoagulation, and continued progression of thrombi, and transferred to our institution for further workup, including hepatic failure, concern for HLH and Castro trophic antiphospholipid syndrome.  Based on chart review, patient had non-specific symptoms for a few weeks prior to the presentation, including GI distress, dysphagia and neck/sinus pain.  CTH done with cerebral edema but not intracranial venous thrombosis.  CT chest and abdomen with no PE, but presence of R popliteal vein thrombus, and portal vein thrombus.  Heparin Ab (PF4 -ELISA test) was negative (at both referring  hospital and current hospital).  Serotonin release assay is pending at the time of report.  While the symptoms are not consistent VITT that were reported (Heparin ab negative, received mRNA vaccines), however this possibility cannot be ruled out.  IVIG was started on 5/27 - 5/28 to treat empirically for concern for heparin induced thrombocytopenia vs VITT.

                                                Patient experienced a thunderclap headache during a workout at about 6:00pm on 05/05/2021. She also had nausea, light sensitivity, and neck stiffness. She went to urgent care around 8:00pm and received a shot of toradol for suspected migraine. When the headache didn&#39;t resolve completely, she went to the emergency room around 11pm. On 05/06 around 5:30am, a CT scan revealed a subarachnoid hemorrhage over the right sylvian fissure. A CTA of the head and neck immediately following showed no aneurysm or AVM. The patient was admitted, and underwent a catheter angiogram later that afternoon, which also showed no aneurysm or AVM. She was admitted to the NeuroICU for one week, took nimodipine and keppra as prescribed, underwent transcranial dopplers daily to check for vasospasm, and did not develop any major complications. Patient developed worsening pain near the tailbone while hospitalized, which was attributed to nerve pain from blood in the subarachnoid space. On 05/12/2021, the patient underwent a second catheter angiogram, which also showed no aneurysm, AVM, or abnormality. The patient was discharged home on 05/13/2021, with followup with neurosurgeon for a likely third cerebral catheter angiogram.

                                                Early AM 6/16/21: I began noticing petechia on my feet. A bloody sore developed on my lip and my mouth was bleeding a little.  Late afternoon 6/16/21: The petechia moved up my legs and the bleeding in my mouth hadn&#39;t stopped. I was incredibly tired.   6/17/21: The bleeding in mouth worsened. I was having to walk around with gauze in my mouth to control the gum bleeding. More big, black, bloody sores developed in my mouth. The petechia was now covering most my body, including inside my ears and mouth.   6/18/21: I was no longer able to eat without sever pain. I was bleeding profusely when I urinated. Petechia had moved into my eyes. I was incredibly fatigued and I had a migraine that was progressively getting worse over the past 3 days. My mother rushed me to the ER at noon. I was admitted to the hospital within 30 minutes of arriving. They began running tests immediately. I lost track of the amount of blood they took to test. I received a CT Scan and MRI to ensure I wasn&#39;t bleeding from my brain or had a stroke. By 7:30PM I was in the main hospital. I was given a COVID test at this time. They informed me that my platelet count had dropped to 5,000 and they would be giving me bagged platelets(1 bag)  and IVIG (8 glass bottles).    6/19/21: I was woken up around 6:30AM and given a dose of Dexamethasone and B12. They drew more blood a couple hours later. By noon the doctor informed me that my platelet count had increased to 9,000. That evening I had another dose of 7 glass bottles of IVIG.   6/20/21:I was woken up around 6:30AM and given a dose of Dexamethasone and B12. They drew more blood a couple hours later. By noon the doctor informed me that my platelet count had increased to 125,000.   6/21/21: I was released from the hospital due to my platelet count continuing to go up. It was up to 400,000. I was given a prescription for one more dose of Dexamethasone, Sumatriptan for my migraines and told to continue taking B12.   7/1/21: Had a follow up appointment with the hematologist from the hospital and I was informed my platelet count was okay but that I am now anemic.

On 6/30 she woke up from a nap and noticed her left arm was numb and she was unable to move.  Went to acute care facility where had acute onset quadriplegia. Was transferred to local hospital ED where CT scan  or cervical spine and MRI C spine were done with concern for acute spinal cord infarct. Patient was subsequently transferred to hospital for further care.  At hospital her BP was raised to increase blood flow to the spinal cord. Also lumbar drain was inserted for increased cord perfusion. Despite attempt to increase cord perfusion patients symptoms did not improve

                                                The adverse reaction was with my son who is breast fed not with my wife.  On June 28th we took our son  to the doctors for a normal 6 month visit and showed them some of the bruises he had on his arms caused by our daughter grabbing his arms.  They asked normal questions about any bleeding he may have had from circumcision or past shots and we told them none. They said the bruising is okay but to be careful with how our daughter plays with him.   He got his 6 month shots and we went home.  My wife noticed that he was bleeding through the bandaids and his shorts so we went back to the doctors office. They were now concerned and sent us to Hospital. Hospital did extensive blood work and ruled out things like Leukemia and things like lupus for now since his red and white blood cell count was normal. However his Platelet Count is extremely low.   They think he was experiencing ITP or Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura. His platelet count was 5 and should be between 159-350  His body thinks he has a virus and is attacking his platelets. They treated him with immunoglobulins.    Update on Alek. A normal platelet count should be between 159-350 was 5.    The infusion of immunoglobulins he got last night worked. He got his results back and they were good news.  He increase to 132 and then 218.   The hope is that he will maintain or increase the platelet count from here on out.  He?s had a few blood tests last week and his count is very high and hopefully will level out.   My concern is this:  My wife had her 2nd Pfizer shot on June 9th. We started noticing the bruising on or around the 12th or 13th.   I?ve asked at least a dozen doctors and nurses if the virus that my son?s immune system was fighting could have been caused by my wife?s 2nd Pfizer vaccine since she breast feeds. No one can give me an answer nor will they do any testing. Not to mention my son is a COVID baby. My wife and I both had COVID while she was pregnant with him.   If anything you would think someone would care enough to at least test him for COVID or the antibodies. But no. Everyone just blows me off.   Maybe what happened to him and his case could save another little babies life. If it wasn?t for the bruising on his arms caused by my daughter who knows what could have happened. Some doctors say he could have had a brain bleed and died.

The next morning, I started to feel a little crummy, then Sunday evening, I started to feel like my chest was tightening.   I wanted to avoid going to the doctor, so I waited to see if it would stop. Between 2AM - 5AM on Sunday, my symptoms severely worsened. The only way I can describe it is what I imagine a heart attack feeling like. I waited until 8AM to go to the urgent care center?I still felt chest pain, but not that I was in a life or death situation. I figured it was a vaccine side-effect and that I would be fine. The urgent care center wouldn&#39;t see me because of my high temperature, and the nurse on the phone recommended I go straight to the Emergency Room.   By the time I arrived at the ER, I was feeling better, but they still wanted to run some tests on me. Doctor helped take care of me and talked me through everything. They weren&#39;t quite sure what was going on?they suspected it was a pulmonary embolism, so they ran multiple tests. The tests came back fine, so they discharged me and told me to keep taking Ibuprofen and to follow up with my primary care physician that week.  I went home that day, and started to feel better. By the next day, I was back at work and felt totally fine again! I followed up with my PC doc that week, and everything looked completely normal.   As more studies &amp; research has been conducted over the past few months with the COVID-19 vaccine, I am 90% sure that I suffered from myocarditis?a new side effect mostly found in younger children. Everything described in this article sounds like my symptoms and I wanted to share my experience to help the CDC collect more data and information.

She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

                                                Mild anaphylaxis about 20 minutes after dose. Abrupt painful tightening of the throat, no real difficulty breathing. My face felt &#34;buzzy&#34; but didn&#39;t swell and I did not have significant itching. I have had similar reactions in the past to cleaning products and pesticides and usually take a benadryl, though I do carry an epipen and had one with me at the time. Instead of going back in the convention center for medical attention I took a benadryl and waited in the parking garage for about an hour and felt the throat restriction ease a bit. About 10 hours later around 8pm the tightness came back suddenly over about 10 minutes and I took another benadryl. The next morning around 7am I had one more round of tightening and took one more benadryl, and it stopped after that. I told my doctor about it a few days later.

She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

                                                Vaginal bleeding/irregular bleeding; bloody noses; spotting; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient).  This  30-years-old female patient received at hospital bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1  administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as SINGLE DOSE, and dose 2 on 07Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) administered in Arm Left  as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination 30 years. Medical history included ongoing spotting (she has had her tubes tied in the past /She continued to have spotting even after the period was over). The patient got 1st dose on 17Feb2021 and developed Vaginal bleeding, bloody noses.  She said she was having a period every 2 weeks, and &#34;spotting&#34; every other day. The she got 2nd dose on 07Mar2021, and experienced nose is bleeding and vaginal bleeding again.Then it was added she completed both; and keeps having irregular bleeding. she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination 17Feb2021 at an unknown time in the left arm. On that day she noticed irregular bleeding, spotting. Mentioned she has had her tubes tied in the past and so she called her gynecologist who made an appointment for her. Then she got her regular period two weeks later to she cancelled that appointment. She continued to have spotting even after the period was over. She mentioned this to her gynecologist twice and he said to wait and see. She received the second dose 07Mar2021 at 16:50 PM in the left arm. She noticed today on 10Mar2021 she was having vaginal bleeding and spotting with bright red blood and also a nose bleed. Mentioned she also noticed blood with sex. She was concerned and plans to contact her HCP next because her brother had osteosarcoma at 16 years old  and she has a cousin who had thrombocytopenia. Seriousness criteria provided -Other medically important conditions. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it is unlikely  that the reported &#34;vaginal bleeding, spotting with bright red blood and nose bleed&#34; were due to bnt162b2.  These are probably intercurrent medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed of additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Soon after receiving shot, PT experienced dizziness and felt like she was going to pass out, medical team arrived to assess. PT was conscious but shortly thereafter, she had a tonic-clonic seizure. This lasted about 2 minutes, then she was post-ictal for about a minute. Then PT was able to answer questions appropriately and knew where she was. V/S were normal including a BP of 105/70, SPO2-100%, HR-70. EMS was called to transport to ER. Over the next several minutes, PT felt dizzy and tingly. She remained stiff in extremities and had a hard time verbalizing, trying to say that her tongue felt stiff. When EMS arrived, they took her blood sugar, which was 120. She was then taken to ER for further evaluation.

This 30-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 at 14:15 (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication received within 2 weeks of vaccination included birth control. On 30Mar2021, several hours later at 21:00, when she was laying down for bed, the patient started having pain in the right side of her chest when she inhaled. It got worse while laying down. It still hurt to inhale in the morning so she went to urgent care. They did an X-ray of her lungs and determined she had pneumonia developing in her right lung. The patient stated that she had not been sick prior and no fever or anything so was not sure why it came on so suddenly. The patient was treated for pneumonia with an antibiotic. The clinical outcome of pneumonia was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.

                                                I had my first dose of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine on the 5th of April, 2021 at 1pm. I had sore arm and was fatigued which was expected. However, the day I had my vaccine was also the day my menstrual cycle started and just to assure myself I informed the pharmacist and asked if that was okay and they said it shouldn?t be a concern.   I was doing fine until toward the end of day 3. I was expecting my period to stop as it always does on 3rd day  but I started bleeding heavier that day there after. It didn?t worry me much until I started discharging huge blood clots  as big as an apple 2 times every after 30 mins from that moment.   I rushed to the ER later that night(still bleeding heavily with blood clots every now and then) but I was not admitted since my vitals and the blood counts were normal at that moment.   I went back home  and hoped the bleeding would stop but again with on pain or fever what so ever I kept bleeding all day. This is my 5th day of bleeding. Then on Sunday morning, I still kept bleeding heavy and I was too weak that I went back to the ER again.   This time , (day 6) I got admitted because I have had lost a lot of blood and I needed blood transfusion. My HB dropped from 11.3 to 6.7 and it went further down to 5 something. I got 3 units of blood transfusion in the ER. They did ultrasound, CT scans(with and without contrast) and still couldn?t figure out the cause of the bleeding. My uterus showed no problems but my body was not even responding to Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. So the doctor proceeded with an angiogram and did an emergency uterine artery Embolization to stop the blood supply to the uterus. The bleeding stopped there after and I started regaining my vitals.  However, the cause of the bleeding still remains unknown.

After the spin class i was quite sore. a few days went by and by thursday i could barely walk. ( i had stopped all exercise after monday) Friday morning i had went to my local urgent care. The doctor there did xrays and ran blood work. By that night they had called me and told me i needed to go to the hospital and i was diagnosed with Rhabdomyolysis. The muscle pain in my legs was so bad and i was exhausted. I was discharged from the hospital the night of april the 25th. no one could figure out why this happened to me at such a young age and for only going to one spin class that i didnt even work to hard at.

I had no symptoms immediately after vaccine however did develop symptoms within one minute of completing a run. Developed b/l hand swelling and tingling, diffuse hives and itching, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, lips tingling and swelling which required emergency room visit and EpiPen, IV fluids, Benadryl and IV steroids. This is similar to previous reactions I have had to running previously. Symptoms resolved within one hour after treatment in ED.

The fever lasted 18 hours.  She also complained of severe malaise and fatigue lasting 36 hours.  On day 3 (Friday, January 15, 2021) she developed left lower extremity pain that persisted over the weekend.  She was seen in Urgent Care today where she was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis of the proximal vein. She also came to the ETC and was ruled out for a PE.

At 20 mins my throat felt tighter and it was making me cough trying to get air so they gave me 50 ml of benedryl into my right arm. I started to pass out and my breathing was labored so I was given my epipen and taken to the ER. While I was there I was monitored for 4 hours and given 2 more medications. One was a steroid, I?m unsure on the second.

                                                Immune Thrombocytopenia Purpura; the only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of immune thrombocytopenia purpura due to temporal relationship. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including platelet count at baseline and during therapy with subject drug, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then, 2 days later (1/14/21) I had a CBC with diff drawn, as I am currently being worked up for possible ITP and have been getting a CBC with diff every 2 months to monitor my blood counts. My platelets and other blood counts had been trending up and were back in normal ranges when they were last checked back in November. However, when they were checked again in January after the COVID vaccine series, there was evidence of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. I did not have any symptoms related to decreased blood counts.

Concomitant medications included piroxicam (PAXIL) and lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE). Patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient experienced light cough on 11Feb2021 at 14:45 with outcome of recovering, shortness of breath on 11Feb2021  with outcome of recovering, anaphylaxis on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, lost voice entirely on 11Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. The events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. The patient was hospitalized due to the events in Feb2021 for 1 day. Events were considered life threatening. Clinical course: light cough after half an hour from vaccination. Within 2 to 3 hours had lost voice entirely and was suffering from shortness of breath. Her primary physician told her to go to the emergency room or he was calling an ambulance because he said it sounded like anaphylaxis and that her life was in danger.

This then transformed into moderate vaginal bleeding which lasted for about 4 days. I had no other symptoms and this was very unusual and scary. I had a vaginal ultrasound 2 days after the bleeding started and no abnornalities were found. My pap smear is also clear.

After ER visit I was advised to take Zyrtec and Benadryl. I&#39;ve paired it with Mucinex to get rid of phlegm build-up and the doctor prescribed Prednisone which I&#39;m going to start today (03/15/2021). So far I have less tightness/less tingling in heart area (still occurs randomly but not as opten) but still get fatigued and breathless real quick. I&#39;ve also had sporadic headaches brain fog, body chills/aches/weakness/difficulty concentrating. Also had face numbness for 4 days.

                                                Client was vaccinated next to EMT ambulance due to prior allergic reactions and medical history. Approximately 3 minutes after vaccination, client reported onset of throat tightening and proceeded to progress to a full anaphylactic reaction, with stridor and respiratory distress.   At one minute after onset of symptoms, patient was administered 0.3 mL epinephrine IM in the left deltoid, and was transferred to a gurney and then into the rig, where oxygen was applied via non-rebreather mask at 12L/min, and vital signs were taken with  a HR of 96 and BP of 146/113.  Respirations were stridorous and approximately 40-60.  SaO2 after oxygen was high 90&#39;s.   Within the next 3-5 minutes, stridor lessened and client appeared more comfortable and gave a &#34;thumbs up sign&#34;. IM Benadryl was given at approximately 8 minutes post onset.  A second transport ambulance from Medical Center was requested at onset of symptoms and arrived shortly after the dose of Benadryl.  Stridor was minimal and vital signs were HR 95, BP 123/78, with improved respirations, minimal stridor, no accessory muscle use and good air entry.  SaO2 was 100% on oxygen. IV attempt was unsuccessful by local EMT and patient was transferred to the second team for further care and transport to the Medical Center.

                                                I was 22 weeks pregnant when I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Then, 2 weeks later when I was 24 weeks pregnant, I started having vaginal bleeding. I was in the hospital for 3 days as the doctors believed I may be going into very early labor.  They suspect a partial placenta abruption. As a result, my cervix was found to be short, also indicating potential early labor coming. I was put on bed rest. Two weeks after the bleeding started, I lost much of my mucus plug (at 26 weeks). When at hospital at 24 weeks, I was given  steroids to make my baby?s lungs develop faster just in case he?s born soon. I was also prescribed progesterone which I?ve been taking nightly. I?m now also taking magnesium supplements and drinking chamomile tea.  This may be unrelated, but I have also been found to be low in iron so now I?m taking iron supplements too.   Due date is Aug 2, 2021; I?m 31 years old; I am currently 29 weeks pregnant and still have not gone into labor; This is my second pregnancy, my first pregnancy was two years prior, and it was 100% healthy.

I received my first dose of the covid vaccine on March 8th, 2021. I noticed some light spotting afterwards.  The heartbeat was confirmed on March 22nd and I was told I was six weeks along. I received my second dose on March 29th.  The heartbeat was confirmed again during another ultrasound on April 20th, 2021. During an ultrasound on May 4th, 2021 I was told that there was no longer a heartbeat and the baby had stopped developing a week prior.  This missed miscarriage resulted in an D&amp;C on May 11th, 2021.

                                                On the night of 4/26 I experienced the worst headache of my life and severe GI upset. The GI upset abated within 24 hours but the headaches persisted on and off for over a month until the night of 6/10, when, after sleeping for 25 hours, I was unable to talk. My partner took me to the ER where it was determined I was having a stroke. I was transferred to another hospital, where I was diagnosed with CVST/Thalamic Stroke and a thrombectomy was performed, followed by an angiogram later that week. As a result of my hypercoagulated state and the angiogram, I developed another clot in my right arm. I was on Heparin and then Coumadin, with Lovenox as a bridge. I just got out of rehab this week.

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25May2021 13:00 at age of 31-year-old (Lot Number: EW0173) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at facility pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There was no known allergies. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient is not pregnant at the time of the vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There was no other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took bnt162b2 dose 1 for COVID-19 immunisation. On 30May2021, her platelet count bottomed out, she had debilitating migraines that cause stroke like symptoms, she had an unknown neurological disorder that caused her to not be able to walk without falling, 2 hospital stayed. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The patient was hospitalized for the events from May2021 for 5 days. It was unknown if any treatment was received for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included platelet count: reduced, platelet count bottomed out on 30May2021, since the vaccination,  the patient had been tested for COVID-19 via nasal swab in 2021 with unknown result. The outcome of the events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information in the case, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events platelet count decreased, migraine, cerebrovascular accident, nervous system disorder and gait disturbance.

I could not breathe or talk. They sent me home after a x-ray and blood work ruled out no blood clots. They assumed it was a bruised rib and heart burn. The pain got worse so I called my family doctor. She did a cat scan and found fluid built up around my lungs and heart. My heart showed inflammation as well. he stuck me on pain medicine. I now have to go get two different heart tests on 7/12/21 and 7/14/21. My family doctor told me that all these problems developed because of the vaccine&#34;

Then after the bleeding stopped there was some brownish discharge and I went to the doctor, the doctor monitored me on July 8th, 2021, checking baby&#39;s heart and movement. They also checked my vagina and cervix to confirm there was no more bleeding at that time. They said I was okay and they not concerned about it. They also did a test of my urine and found nothing abnormal. I was at the doctor approximately three hours. This is my first child so I have not had any others.

                                                Ok so well on May 15 I had a confirmed pregnancy test however on May 27, 2021 I had sharp pains in my stomach. I passed blood clots. I went to the ER and they confirmed there was no fetus, and they did testing. It came back that I had passed the embryo. They performed some blood work, which included a test for antibodies and that came back elevated so therefore I was told to have Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. Prior to the vaccine I was not diagnosed, so this is the information that I have. The time of miscarriage, I would have been 5 weeks pregnant so it was considered an early pregnancy loss. So I have had one pregnancy three years ago and since then, I have been trying to get pregnant and through IVF. My estimated date of delivery would have been January 27, 2022.

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

This also started within 24 hours of receiving the first shot and lasted for 5 days.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cefazolin and levaquin and experienced allergies to both. The patient has a Mirena IUD and never get her period at all. Within 6 hours of her first Pfizer injection (02Feb2021 16:00), the patient experienced crippling lower abdominal pain followed by very very heavy bleeding and clotting. Resolved within 48 hours as quickly as it came and didn&#39;t occur with second dose 1 week out. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The events were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On Sunday, 04/18, I went and received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 12:30 pm on my left arm. It hurt much sooner than the first, within a couple hours. It hurt worse as well. The next morning was Monday. My arm was super sore. I work from home and went by my normal routine. Oatmeal with raspberries and blueberries.  I eat this every day. I started work at 9 AM. Around 9:30 Am or so, I started having sneezing fits. Which I thought was annoying more than anything, but didn&#39;t think anything of it, until the fits developed into my hands itching, burning, turning red. I looked at my face and noticed it was red and swelling.  I&#39;ve had skin allergies before, but nothing outside of hives and maybe a little skin swelling.  I have an allergy to bees. Worse that ever occurred was hives. This instance did not produce hives but a very beet red rash and swelling.  Then very quickly after, my tongue started swelling and my throat started tightening. I called my mother as I noted this was life threatening and went to the ER. I was informed I had experienced anaphylaxis.  My heart rate going in to the ER was 166. I have never experienced this in the 32 years I&#39;ve lived before.  I was administered an Epi and steroids. As soon as I realized what it was, even in my panic, I was lucky to make a judgment call to save my life. The doctor said to throw out the berries just in case. The odd thing is, I eat this every day...no issues. I realize it is rare for reactions to be delayed, but was made aware it is possible.  I was not stung by anything to make this occur.

                                                I am 3 months post partum. The day after  I received my shot, my pelvic area had a odd feeling. Almost like my uterus felt a dull very very mild pressure. Day 2 after receiving my shot, I started to bleed. I am exclusively breastfeeding and I have never had a period start this early with all of my other children. Normal is 7 plus months for me. This period was also not a normal period. I had zero cramps. I felt nothing. I never have had a period with zero cramps. Lasted for 7 days.

A 2nd ER visit showed clot above and below her knee and in her greater saphenous vein which is a risk for deep venous thromboembolism and she was started on rivaroxaban (anticoagulation).

Other risk factors include active COVID-19 infection (unknown at time of vaccine administration) and OCP usage.

                                                My period was extremely heavy for a few hours on day two of my cycle. I couldn?t leave the bathroom, the blood was very thin and had lots of clots. It was just evacuating my body so quickly. Normally, my period is very consistently light. This has never happened to me in my entire 20 years of menstruating. It was painless, no cramps, just very heavy and then after a few hours of nonstop bleeding, it went back to normal. It?s almost like the entire living decided to shed in a few hours rather than the extended few days that it normally happens in. The whole cycle still only lasted a few days like normal, just those few hours were noticeably abnormally heavy.

                                                5 minutes after vaccination, I felt unwell. I sat with EMS that was onsite. HR was 160&#39;s, BP 160&#39;s systolic. Right arm went numb in first 5 minutes and my face went numb after 15 minutes post injection. After sitting 45 minutes with EMS my vitals stabilized and no numbness present. I walked to the car, sat in the car for 10 minutes and then I went into anaphylaxis. My airways began to close. My husband got the EMS on site and I was taken by ambulance to the ER. I was given IM Benadryl in the ambulance. In the ER I was given IV Benadryl and IV steroids.   After anaphylaxis event I had difficulty breathing for 3 weeks from enlarged lymph nodes. I had extreme shortness of breath for the 2 weeks following injection in that I had to crawl up the flight of stairs to the second level of our home.   About the 3rd week after injection, I began having full body itching  with no known stimuli. Only benadryl would treat it. I was on allegra or zyrtec daily. I would also develop 1 or 2 hives on my right arm.   4 weeks after injections I was reacting to food and drink. I could not drink alcohol- gin or vodka- it would result in full body itching and a few hives. I did a course of prednisone, and it decreased my allergic reactions and I felt almost normal for several months.  On May 8th, 2021 I had be experiencing great stress since February from a family member&#39;s cancer diagnosis. I had a crying event and immediately after I had an allergic reaction to gin, which had not occurred since the course of steroids.  Today is 5/13 and I have had 2 additional allergic reactions: one involving food and the other flowers. None of which I have ever been allergic to before. I have full body itching and I am now developing hives more often.

Upon getting out of bed I immediately sat on the floor due to the extreme dizziness and fear of passing out I felt. After a few minutes in this state I vomited. I had a fever which I managed with Tylenol. I felt fatigued and weak the entire day. I ran a fever the entire day, again managing it with Tylenol.  The following day (4/25/2021) my fever was gone and I felt better, however about midday I began experiencing cramps and vaginal bleeding. I was 5.5weeks pregnant with an estimated due date of 12/24/2021. I went to the ER with concerns of a miscarriage. Based on abdominal ultrasound and subsequent HCGquant testing over the next week it was determined I had encountered a miscarriage and lost the baby.

I am pregnant with twins and I experienced vaginal bleeding on 05/07/2021. It was determined that it was due to Placenta Previa. I was 14 weeks pregnant at the time.  At the moment I have been advised to take it easy and the babies are fine.  Due Date-10/30/2021 Pregnancy-Second

A 32-year-old female patient received BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 28Apr2021 17:15 (Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) at 32 years-old as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No known allergies. The patient previously received BNT162B2, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 07Apr2021 17:45 (Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) at 32 years-old as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced local pain and little bit of dizziness right after the vaccine. On 29Apr2021 02:45, the patient experienced got sharp abdominal pain during ovulation on the right side on 11th day after vaccine as well as bleeding during ovulation time on 13th day, dizziness, fever of 102.3, chills, headache, bodyache, weakness, arm pain and swollenness near injection site for 2-3 days, arm pain and swollenness near injection site for 2-3 days, a little lymph node swelling in armpits. In May2021, the patient experienced some chest pain and gas starting on the 10th day. The clinical course was reported as follows: Second dose - dizziness after vaccine, Fever of 102.3, chills, headache, body ache in the middle of the night after vaccine. Fever subsided after next day, headache and weakness persisted. Arm pain and swollenness near injection site for 2-3 days. A little lymph node swelling in armpits for next 5-6 days. Got ok after this. But again, some chest pain and gas starting on the 10th day, perhaps due to ovulation time. However, a striking note is that after almost 2 years got sharp abdominal pain during ovulation on the right side on 11th day after vaccine as well as bleeding during ovulation time on 13th day. Chest pain still lingering. Concerned that it is not a blood clot issue. Or that the vaccine is interfering with the hormonal system. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination and did not received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events weakness, headache and chest pain was not recovered; Fever of 102.3 was recovering. The outcome of the other events was unknown.  The following information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                The morning after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine I began experiencing vaginal bleeding. This lasted approximately 5-6 hours, then started again the following day and lasted overnight, for approximately 12 hours.  I was pregnant at the time of the vaccine being administered, just over 14 weeks.  The day the bleeding stopped (day 3) was the first day of week 15.  I contacted the on call OB who suggested I follow-up with my regular OB on Monday, or to go to the ER if it got worse. During the exam on 5/24/2021 the OB was unable to determine anything wrong with the placenta, baby or my heath and was unable to explain the bleeding other than a potential side effect of the vaccine.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist. A 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0177; Expiration date was not reported) on 15May2021 (13:45) as a 1st dose, single dose, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to sulfa. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. On 17May2021, the patient had pulmonary embolism. The event had resulted into an emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had received enoxaparin (LOVENOX) as treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was recovering. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested since the vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of pulmonary embolism due to temporal relationship. However, the reported event may possibly represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient.   There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including pulmonary angiogram, VQ scan, chest CT/MRI and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications including any history of use of oral contraceptives. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

As the days continued I began to develop more bumps on Left heel that traveled to my right foot. In total I have 10 plantar warts that developed which has caused my to be temporarily disabled from work.  Shortly after when I recieved my menstraul cycle, it was extremely heavy and full of large blood clots. This was not my baseline. we are in the month of June and I have had irregular periods ever since vaccine. In March 2020 I had a cardiovascular incident that resulted in a RIGHT BUNLE BRANCH BLOCK. I&#39;m following a cardiologist. I have had multiple issues with my body ever since I received this vaccine and urge the public to please read and educate yourself before you get it. Im just now starting to experience tingling in my arms and legs. All of the issues Ive list are all AUTOIMMUNE ISSUES. This vaccine has destroyed my health and hijacked my immune system.

                                                Patient had child via c-section on 6/9/2021. Received dose #1 of Pfizer 6/15/2021.  Had normal post-partum bleeding.  Second dose 7/6/2021.  Approximately 7/7/2021 she started having increased vaginal bleeding, darker and with an odor following by intermittent generalized abdominal pain.  Pain progressed to become constant and included low back pain and some nausea.  OBgyn ruled out other causes of increased increased post-partum bleeding, suspected having early menses (though is breastfeeding) vs AE of recent Pfizer vaccines.  On 7/14/2021 she had sudden severe abdominal pain, and was diagnosed with acute appendicitis in the ER (Presbyterian Dallas).

The redness and itching last 4-5 days. I had to stay on Benadryl and Zyrtec to help with the redness and itching.  My job sent me to the ER to be monitored after getting the shot until I went home. The fatigue lasted for a whole week.

                                                Dose #1- 2 days after receiving my first covid 19 vaccine I had 2 days of scant/light vaginal bleeding and lower back pain. Very abnormal because I have the Nexplanon implanted in my arm and may have 2-3 periods per year. Normally the periods I do have are heavier and last 3-5days.  One week later I had about 3 days of left ovarian pain. Dose # 2- One day (which is today) after receiving my second vaccine I started with scant/ light vaginal bleeding and lower back pain. No ovarian pain yet.

The day after the vaccine (2/4) I started having some vaginal bleeding, confirmed with ultrasound.  This progressed to having a miscarriage, confirmed via ultrasound 2/9.  My OBGYN said she does not think they are related, but there is no way to tell. Until 2/4, I had no issues with my pregnancy.

                                                pneumonia; Fever; chills; nausea; difficulty breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 33-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 21Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient experienced fever, chills, nausea, pneumonia, and difficulty breathing on 11Feb2021 23:00 with outcome of recovering. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed of covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab test post vaccination: negative on 13Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events (antibiotics, IV fluids, Tylenol). The patient received second dose (Lot Number: EN6201) on 12Feb2021 12:00 PM in the left arm.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events fever, chills, and nausea were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events pneumonia and difficulty breathing with Bnt162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I went to urgent care and was prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding to no avail. I then proceeded to go to urgent care again because the bleeding had not stopped. At my second Doctors visit, I had an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound done, and both of them came back completely normal. I have now scheduled an upcoming obgyn appointment, but cannot be seen until 03/09/2021.

                                                I experienced a miscarriage that started with bleeding on 3/13 and was confirmed by ongoing hcg level tests starting on 3/17. I passed a lot of blood and blood tissue in an intense event on 3/16. I did not know I was pregnant at the time and was estimated to be around 9-10 weeks (due date around October 2021) based on hcg levels. I was also breastfeeding at the time of my vaccine. I was advised to go to the emergency room if certain conditions occurred including extreme pain -- I opted to go to Urgent Care that evening to get checked out and to get a blood hcg test. Urgent care was unable to do the blood test and they recommended I call my provider the next day or go to the Emergency Department if certain symptoms occurred.

I am a 33 year female with no history or family history of blood clots. I received the 2nd dose of my Pfizer vaccine on Apr 2 and on Apr 5 I began experiencing pain in my right leg. I had not injured it, and by Apr 14 I felt compelled due to the increased pain to contact a medical professional. They ran a d-dimer and mine came back high at 0.89. I was instructed by my PAC to go to the ER and tell them about the elevated d-dimer results. At the ER they performed an ultrasound and confirmed &#34;Acute occlusive deep venous thrombosis in the right calf involving the entire length of 1 peroneal vein.&#34;. They also performed a CT scan on my chest and discovered &#34;Right lower lobe distal segmental and subsegmental pulmonary artery emboli&#34;. They also performed a series of blood tests, all of those came back fine. I am being treated with 15mg of rivaroxaban (Xeralto).

                                                Noticed feeling extremely lethargic, heart rate increased, had grand mal seizure. Spouse said that the event was not as long or aggressive as typical grand mal episodes. Previously seizure-free for over a year and a half. Last blood lamotrigine levels tested 3/02/2021 and was out of standard range on the low end. Dosage of lamotrigine increased to compensate (225 mg AM/200 mg/PM) after obtaining results.  Dosage increased again (225 mg 2x/day) after seizure episode. Pending blood level retest in May. Event is likely due to low medicinal levels aggravated by immune response.   First pregnancy, event occurred at 30 weeks gestation. Estimated delivery 6/17/2021. Seizure occurred in bed and no physical external damage happened to the abdomen. Fetal movement is typical and predictable.

                                                I got my first COVID shot when I was 5 weeks pregnant.  Due date 12/14/21.  It was a Tuesday afternoon that I got the shot, and by Thursday morning around 0700, I had heavy vaginal bleeding and intense cramping.  The bleeding and cramping lasted 2 days. My OB ordered an ultrasound on Friday, and thankfully baby had a heartbeat.  My repeat ultrasound on 4/26 also showed that baby was growing and had a heartbeat.  This is my fourth pregnancy, and I&#39;ve never had any bleeding in my first trimester.

                                                The next day after I received the Pfizer vaccine I started feeling sick and lightheaded it had a headache. I think nothing of it and then my menstrual cycle started early and it started off being heavier than usual. Then I notice when I went to wipe myself or use the bathroom blood clots was falling out. Being that I work in the medical field I know like if is not bigger than 1/4 there&#39;s nothing to really worry about. So as the day went on and the following days I noticed that the blood clots kept on getting bigger and bigger and coming faster and faster. At this point I started getting concerned, that&#39;s when I decided to go to the hospital. At the emergency room at Hospital  they really didn&#39;t do nothing for me but gave me an ultrasound and gave me some birth control told me to follow up with my OBGYN. But I already made an appointment with OBGYN cuz I just feel like if something was going on and I can&#39;t get in to see them till June 30th. They did give me some birth control and tell me your help with the bleeding and for me to take some ferrous sulfate. They said they&#39;d never heard of this reaction before. So I went on May 1st to get my second vaccine. Before I received it, I talked to doctor there and they told me it would be fine for me to get it. Now my symptoms and reactions are starting all over. I&#39;m so concerned about what&#39;s going on with my body. I just need somebody to explain to me what&#39;s going on. I cannot afford another hospital ER bill again.

This month (2 weeks after the second dose) my period started before I finished the hormones. About 3 days before they were done. I also had noticibly more cramping and the bleeding was light but a very dark brown. I haven&#39;t done anything for it yet. I am monitoring it to see if it gets better or worse. I believe that maybe the vaccine did something to my hormones because the morning after Vax #2 my breasts and nipples were sore.

A non-pregnant 33-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 03Mar2021 at 10:45 AM (Lot number: UNKNONW), at the age of 33 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included protein C deficiency, drug hypersensitivity to Sulfa. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported &#34;I had DVT&#39;s in my right calf that landed me in the emergency room (ER) a week after my first shot on 08Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;I had DVTs in my right calf that landed me in the emergency room (ER) and included blood thinning medication. The clinical outcome of DVT was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I reached out to my OB/GYN who suggested I stop taking them for about five days then restart the oral contraceptive a a double dose for five days. I was told to contact the office again if this did not stop the bleeding as I would need an ultrasound . It worked for about a week and now I?m bleeding again and will be contacting my doctors office.

                                                I was not pregnant at the time of my first vaccine- I first tested positive on April 24, about 2.5 weeks after my first vaccine. This is my first pregnancy. Estimated date of delivery is December 31, 2021.   On May 3, I began spotting. I had an ultrasound where pregnancy was confirmed. On May 6 I began bleeding- I had another ultrasound that confirmed a subchorionic hematoma (SCH). Due to the level of bleeding and size of the SCH, as well as low progesterone and somewhat slow rising HCG levels (though not dangerously low), I was told to prepare for miscarriage. At a follow up appointment on May 13, one day after my second Pfizer vaccine, the ultrasound showed normal embryonic development and a heartbeat! Follow up appointment on May 20 showed continued normal development, as well as a collapsed and smaller SCH. I continue to have some light cramping and spotting.  I do not have any reason to suspect that this even was a result of the vaccine- but as it (and my positive pregnancy test) took place during the vaccination process, I wanted to report.

                                                ITP; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 33-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, on 14May2021 (batch/lot number was not reported), as unknown, single dose, at age 33 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included systemic lupus erythematosus (reported as &#34;h/o SLE0&#34;) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 18May2021, the patient experienced ITP (immune thrombocytopenia). The event required hospitalization on an unspecified date with duration 4 days. Treatment included Decadron 40 mg IV x 4 days. On 21May2021, the patient underwent COVID-19 nasal swab with result: negative. The patient recovered from the event on an unspecified date.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                What happened on the day April 30th is about 5 minutes after the vaccination they had me laying down already so I wouldn&#39;t pass out because I passed out on the first vaccine. I became very confused and disoriented and had brain fog that didn&#39;t go away for about 3 weeks (about the 16th of May), it lasted a really long time. I didn&#39;t know who I was or where I was and confused and on the edge of consciousness for about 45 minutes on that day. On May 13th I had a severe reaction to something and my throat closed up. Starting April 30th I had a severe cough that lasted most of May and my Doctor gave me an inhaler around the 20th of May. On May 13th I went to emergency room (they gave me Benadryl) and they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong with my heart or systems in general and kept me for observation. I then followed up with my Dr later on that week and they initially thought I had asthma and they gave me an EpiPen in case I had another reaction like that. After that I&#39;ve had 5 times where I had anaphylaxis where I had to use the EpiPen and this is new because I haven&#39;t had anaphylaxis since I was 15.  Around 17th of May my brain fog started lessening and I would have 1 anaphylaxis x reaction a week since then and I continue to see my Doctor. She said I may have a genetic mast cell disorder that was activated by the vaccine. I am now on a daily emergency inhaler and EpiPen.

                                                I started bleeding heavily in the middle of the night, I was pregnant so it was really scary. I was taken in an ambulance to the hospital and I had an emergency C-section because I was bleeding so much. They found out that my placenta had torn away from the uterus which is why they had to take the baby out. That is called placenta abruption. I was 35 weeks pregnant. The baby was fine and I was in the hospital for like 5 days. I had hemorrhage too much like 2 liters of blood. I was not in labor really. I had pre-labor contractions but I was not in labor. My doctor told me that this happens sometimes and it is really rare. They did fetal monitoring, they tested the baby&#39;s umbilical chord for oxygen to make sure the baby did not suffered any oxygen deprivation and my baby was fine. After they delivered the baby everything was fine.  Pregnancy history: everything was perfect before this, I actually had an ultrasound 2 days before this and everything was fine. This is my first baby. My baby was born 5 weeks early, so at 35 weeks. Estimated due date was  06/29/2021. Birth weight: 5 and a half pounds.

Beginning 4/25/21, I had intense GI issues, NVD, resulting in a trip to Urgent Care on 4/26.  The PA thought it was gastroenteritis and to follow-up if I wasn&#39;t feeling well later in the week.  The following Monday, I went to the ER as I wasn&#39;t better, had a CT scan which showed my appendix had burst and abscessed.  I had an emergency laproscopic appendectomy on 5/3, released from the hospital 5/4.  On 5/10 I felt a sharp pain in my lower back that I attributed to a pulled muscle.  After several days of difficulty breathing, intense periodic back pain, I went back to the ER on 5/14 and I was diagnosed with a small PE in my right lung after CT scan.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

A rapid response was called and patient was transferred to the emergency department.  She was protecting her airway.  En route to the ED, patient&#39;s eyes rolled backwards and she began having generalized tonic-clonic movement indicative of a seizure.  Patient was turned onto her side until seizure activity subsided.   Post-ictal state lasted approximately 5-10 minutes after seizure activity ceased and patient became alert and oriented and able to answer all questions.  All lab tests and imaging were normal.

I then went to Hospital where they did more lab work and blood testing, they did an D-dimer test ad my level was at 3.23 and explained to me it could be due to my pregnancy. They ran some more tests showing I have a  clot in the superficial femoral/ popliteal vein. They placed me on Lovanox medication for two days. I will be seeing a maternal fetal doctor tomorrow for further evaluation. They also monitored my baby and baby is doing fine.

Discomfort and feeling of swelling continued through Sunday evening. Monday (3/15/21) patient began using compression stocking and elevating leg, which eased some discomfort. Slight swelling, discomfort, and heat in the leg continued throughout entire week. DVT presumed. Contacted physician. Treatment for DVT and treatment dosage (Fondaparinux 7.5mg) commenced Wednesday (3/17/21) through to date. Discomfort has dissipated but slight swelling still remains. Appears to be getting better each day, although a very slow progression. Patient history of antiphospholipid syndrome has been managed for over fifteen years with blood thinners. Onset of a clotting event always followed a justifiable cause. No spontaneous/unexplainable clotting events to date. Patient otherwise healthy without any other current event which could explain a blood clot following vaccination. Reporting this information as it may be helpful in determining whether persons with APS or similar condition should receive Covid-19 vaccination. Note: this information being provided by patient.

VERY SEVERE mental health issues, sadness, hopelessness, irritibility that I do not normally experience with PMS normally. I also am extremely regular with my menstruation and have tracked my period for years, and it is always consistent. as of 4/5 still having very heavy bleeding and clotting, some cramping. bleeding is showing no signs of letting up and my period expected start date is around 4/13. I almost didn&#39;t want to say anything because it could be chalked up to hormones or stress but this has not happened to me before, and the emotional state I was in was very bad, not even taking into account the bleeding. I am a very pro science and pro data person so I was hesitant to mention anything at all, but feel like IF this is related this could be a huge risk for folks who have a history of depression and anxiety or post partum conditions. The best way I can describe it was deep hopelessness, something I had not felt since having post partum depression when my daughter was born, 7 years ago.

                                                1630: Participant presented after getting stuck twice by vaccinator and questioned if she received two doses of the vaccine. Per the vaccinators, this participant was the sixth and final dose of the vial. Vaccinator initially went to administer the dose and noted that there was nothing in the syringe when he went to push the plunger.   After reviewing the vial with the pharmacy staff, there is still vaccine in the vial with enough volume for a possible seventh dose. With this information I discussed with the participant that participant did not receive two doses. Participant started crying and developing chest pain which prompted an evaluation by EMS team in house at the vaccination center. Due to chest pain, she was given nitroglycerin x 1, and sent to local hospital via ambulance for further evaluation.  We received report from hospital that participant had an MI and was sent to catheterization lab.

                                                1 April, woke up at 0800 with slight headache and felt fatigued but most noticeably my voice sounded weird and my throat was extremely hoarse while talking in work meeting and I had to constantly cough to clear it. I was having a bit of trouble swallowing as well. In the afternoon, my headache got worse and I had diarrhea. Around 7:45pm I started feeling extreme itchiness and swelling in my tongue. This didn&#39;t improve, so I took 25mg Benedryl at 8:20pm, at which time my vitals were normal, but noticeably lower than usual with a HR of ~60, BP of 100/70, O2 sat 99% and normal temp. I also took another 1000mg Tylenol at 9:30pm and went to bed.  2 April, 0730 woke up and my throat and tongue started swelling again and were very itchy. I began have difficulty breathing and swallowing saliva. I also could not swallow a banana easily, so I stopped eating it. I also had some wheezing that would only go away with a cough. Took 25mg more of Benedryl and went to urgent care immediately because breathing was becoming increasingly difficult.   Treatment: At urgent car I was diagnosed with anaphylactic reaction due to vaccination and given another 25mg Benedryl injection and 10mg Prednisone. Vitals were BP:144/90, HR:83, TMP 98.5. Doctor considered epinephrine instead of Benedryl but &#34;didn&#39;t want to have to send me to the ER&#34;. I was monitored for about 45 minutes and while my difficulty breathing did not improve much, it also did not worsen. I was sent home with Medrol steroid pack, Atarax and an EpiPen. My breathing ability did not return to normal until about ~3 days later.

Period started a week early on 4/22 and is still going on. Usually done within 5 days and not nearly as heavy with clots like this. ER suggested I report a possible correlation between that and the vaccine as they have seen it with other patients as well. ER doctor medicated with birth control hormones to slow down bleeding.

                                                On April 12, shortly after I got my second Pfizer shot, I started my period. It was very early by several weeks, and only a week since my previous period ended, which is why I made note of it and have kept a record.  For the first week it was fairly light and mostly spotting. After a week, it progressed and became more like a normal period in terms of the amount of blood I was seeing. By April 23rd I started noticing a lot more blood clots in my period than usual--ordinarily I&#39;ll see one or two each time I get my period, but there were about five days in a row when I noticed multiple blood clots. The clots stopped around April 28th, but as of today (May 3rd) my period is still ongoing, making it exactly three weeks long, and more unless it suddenly stops today.  For the most part the blood has been red and I haven&#39;t noticed any other unusual discharge. I have noticed the past few days that the blood is more brown, like old blood.  I have not experienced bad cramps or stomach upset during this very long period--I had the same level of menstrual cramping/stomach upset that I am accustomed to over the first couple of days, but nothing since then. I have felt bloated and tired the entire time, however. I have also experienced a really low mood for these few weeks, though I can&#39;t be certain if this is worse than I usually experience on my period, because it may just be because it&#39;s lasting so long that it feels worse.

                                                Patient presented to her PCP office on 04/20 reporting that on 04/16 she received her 2nd Pfizer vaccine and the following day on 04/17 she started feeling muscle aches, fatigue and R calf pain from high ankle to the back of knee. On 04/18, all symptoms except the calf pain resolved. She continued to have 1-2/10  calf pain w/o skin changes but mild R &gt; L enlargement of the lower leg. Reported a 3 hour car ride on 04/18 after the calf pain had already started. Denied chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. On exam, vital signs stable, right lower leg diffusely tender to palpation and noted to be 4 cm larger in circumference than the left side.  Patient was sent for an urgent outpatient duplex ultrasound of her right lower extremity. Ultrasound showed distal DVT in right peroneal veins. She was immediately instructed to discontinue the use of the Nuva ring and started on Xarelto 15 mg BID, with good symptom improvement. Was followed up in clinic on 05/05 with plan to transition to the Xarelto 20 mg QD on 05/13 for a total of 3 months of anticoagulation.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for herself. A 34-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Apr2021 12:00 at 34 years old (Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Anemia, Depression, Chronic Dry Eye, penicillin allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lifitegrast (XIIDRA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (SUDAFED) and experienced drug allergy. An hour after the vaccine on 03Apr2021, patient&#39;s fingers were red and swollen (like after exercise on a hot day) and she was itchy all over her body. No symptoms for almost 4 days--then she started feeling intermittently dizzy/lightheaded, feverish every night (chills and hot flashes) for the next 4 nights. She got a wracking cough and was short of breath (couldn&#39;t climb a single flight of stairs without needing to lie down for several minutes). She was also extremely exhausted-- slept 20 hours in a single day. After multiple telemedicine and in-person appointments, a trip to urgent care, and a chest x-ray and CT, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with antibiotics, vitamin D, and two inhalers. She missed her period, had an elevated d-dimer, and her white blood cell count dropped from 7.0 Thousand u/L to 3.6. She was incapacitated for 2 weeks-- the sickest she had ever been in her life. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient performed Nasal Swab, negative on 11Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken for pneumonia. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                I am a woman who has PCOS. My cycle is extremely inconsistent and never last more than a day maybe once every year or 2. Two weeks after my 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine I started my menstral cycle , experiencing cramps, discomfort, pressure in my uterus, blood clots daily, and so far it?s been for 8 days. I am not alarmed yet because I understand this might be natural but I am documenting this because it is out of the ordinary in my unique case.   I also experienced what seemed like a stomach flu for about 2 days On the 6th and 7th of June. Experiencing diarrhea, nausea, no fever, but heavy fatigue. I no longer feel sick but my period is still active.

I experienced a late-term stillbirth  approximately 24 days after the second dose of the pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I had otherwise not experienced any side effects with either dose of the vaccine.  I received my vaccine via the clinic.  The stillbirth likely occurred on May 6, but was not confirmed by ultrasound until the morning of May 7.  The only sign of the IUFD was cessation of the baby&#39;s movements; the event was not accompanied by any pain or bleeding.  There was no physical trauma (fall, force to the abdomen, etc).  The only event of note between the second dose and the stillbirth was that I went on a four-hour hike Placenta analysis and the fetal autopsy confirmed thrombosis in the placenta&#39;s chorionic vessels and a focal increase in syncytial knots, with a diagnosis that placental changes were consistent with fetal vascular malperfusion.  The fetus was anatomically normal and appropriate size and weight for gestational age (28 weeks and 6 days per ultrasound).  The fetus had no abnormalities or other signs of trauma or infection beyond expected maceration.  My ob/gyn and Dr. both opine that the blood clots caused IUFD, with the event being very sudden/acute.  There was no explanation identified for what could have caused the sudden blood clots.  This was my first pregnancy.  I was 29 weeks 0 days along when the IUFD was confirmed, with an estimated due date of July 20, 2021.  The pregnancy was unremarkable up until the IUFD.  Birth weight was approximately 1230 grams.

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

Every time I would take a deep breath I would feel the pain.  Called loyola hotline to discuss and state worries I had. Pain continued the next day. Went to the loyola urgent care center Monday at about noon. Took EKG test there and everything seemed fine however they did mention my birth control and possible side effects. So they sent me to thenhospotal for more test. Sent me to the ER. From the ER took several test and blood work. Another eck as well as D-dimer test, lots of blood work and a CT scan. Later that night I was told I had a pulmanary embolism (blood clot in my lung) and I needed to stay overnight. They continued to take addt. Exams the next day and.more blood for test. Took a heart echo since pains were happening on my left side. As well as ultrasound on my leg to check for DVT and if more blood clots exist.. Addt. Test done that Tuesday, then was discharged Tuesday at about 5pm.

I did receive the flu vaccine in the fall of 2020 but no other vaccines or medications than those previously reported. On 4/23/2021 I began experiencing a small amount of bloody discharge which continued for 10 days. I was evaluated in OB triage on 5/5 by exam, blood work and ultrasound. All tests came back normal and the pathology from discharge was blood and mucus. The discharge continued until 2 weeks later on 5/19 when it became brighter red. I was evaluated by OB triage again by exam and blood work with normal results. Cervix showed no signs of labor and I was not dilated. On 5/20 I began leaking amniotic fluid and my water broke. My son was born at 30 weeks and 3 days (due date 7/26/2021). He is in NICU as of this report but doing as well as could be expected.

                                                I just had my second shot yesterday morning. For the first dose, I didn&#39;t have any of the typical side effects other than sore arm. On June 4th, I started having vaginal bleeding. I called the on call triage and the bleeding was significant enough to go to ER. Was there and almost had a DNC at that point because the doctor felt the bleeding was so significant. But there was a wait in ER,  had an ultrasound, by that time bleeding slowed down and I went home with the caveat that if the bleeding returned to go to ER again. The doctor&#39;s were saying that a miscarriage was going to happen....so we were taking it day by day. 10 days later, I started bleeding again and then I miscarried on Tuesday of this week.  I started cramping at 1;:00 in the morning and felt the water break and then started bleeding heavily again at 03:00 in morning. Follow up with OB&#39;s on June 7th.

                                                Pt. started coughing Tuesday, June 22, 2021, in the afternoon and it worsened through the rest of day. She also was beginning to be drowsy. Wednesday, June 23, 2021, coughing continued, she became drowsier, she felt warm to the touch (forehead, face, arms, back) and was not acting like herself. Thursday, June 24, 2021, 9am she was at the clinic. The doctor ordered an x-ray and blood work. After results arrived, we were advised to go to the emergency room. There the doctor ordered CT scan. The results showed an abscess and fluid in her left lung and pneumonia. Her lung was drained, was not able to get all of it out. They discussed surgery but needed to send pt. to ER. The discussion for surgery was a daily thing but never happened. They tried multiple procedures, CT scans, etc. On Tuesday, June 29, 2021 there was a meeting called with her doctor to discuss palliative care. The risk of surgery and all the complications following were high risk. Pt. did not understand that she needed to leave the IV and drainage tube in as well as leaving the oxygen on. Based on the complications and pts. quality of life after surgery and the fact that the fluid and pneumonia spread quickly throughout her body - the doctors were leaning towards end-of-life comfort. It all happened so fast! The evening of the 29th, pt. was transported home to end her life on hospice. On Wednesday, June 30, 2021 pt. passed away in the afternoon. Pt. was rarely ever sick. Once in a great while she would get a runny nose or little cough. Everyone around her would catch a virus and she simply would not. We had a member of our family test positive for COVID-19 in November 2020, and pt. never showed any symptoms of being ill.  This was all before she received the COVID-19 Vaccine. About a week or two after she received the second vaccine, on May 27,2021. she had increased behaviors with eating and daily ADLs. But the behaviors were her ?normal? behaviors that would occasionally come and go. Nothing was ever persistent.  Then on Tuesday June 22, 2021 when sick like symptoms started to appear it was less then four weeks after the second vaccine.

                                                Adverse menstrual issues: - First period after vaccine EXTREMELY painful.  Pain NOT like period cramps, instead was similar to pain I have experienced after previous uterine surgeries (ie. feeling severely inflamed). Period was heavier &#43; lasted 2 days longer than usual.  - Second &#43; third periods after vaccine painful again. Much less so than the prior month, but still much more pain than I usually feel. Pain seems to radiate from lower back &#43; lower abdomen. Period slightly heavier still.  - Third period after vaccine I passed a large stringy blood clot. I have never done this before.  - Experiencing increase in endometriosis pain. Usually pain is quite sporadic &#43; only occurs 10 times a year . Now experiencing pain weekly or biweekly.   NB. I have Asherman?s Syndrome. Due to this I haven?t experienced any period pain for 6yrs &#43; my periods have been extremely light. This has been well documented with my Obgyn &#43; Reproductive Endocrinologist. Therefore I can conclusively identify the vaccine as signaling these changes to my menstrual cycle.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the booster dose, she awoke feeling extremely ill and nauseous, roused me to say so, and then immediately became unresponsive and pulseless. She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name). Events visit to Emergency Room. They did a CBC and she was in normal range for everything. Lab data included on 20Jan2021: CBC normal. Outcome of the event Swollen tongue was recovering.  Outcome of the event Anaphylactic reaction/anaphylaxis was recovered.  Outcome of the event injection site soreness was not recovered. Outcome of the events was unknown.

The nurse on call advised me to go to the ER. I went to ER, they ran an ultra sound and all kinds of test, they said everything looked good they thought it was a Fibroid. They discharged me, and that night at 11:30pm I had a very big and fast bleed around a cup of blood and went back to the ER. That time I went to hospital because it was closer. Again they did an ultrasound and thought it was a Fibroid. I ended up seeing my OB GYN 2/8/21, she said she didn&#39;t think it was a Fibroid and sent me to get an ultrasound on 2/12/21. At that point after the bleed I had 4 days of spotting. When I went to the ultrasound they said I had a partial placenta abruption and my cervex has shortened. Since then everything has been fine.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot number and expiration date not provided, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 16:20 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was advised because she has been in her house so long that she is basically an agoraphobe and psychologist qualified because diagnosed with ADHD and profound anxiety at the fear of dying from COVID, anxiety and Covid-19, Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that yesterday 07Apr2021 she got her first round of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and came home and got the worst headache she ever had in her life. She states then she projectile vomited and started uncontrollably shaking. The patient stated that she was shaking uncontrollably so bad she had to take a bath. She once she took a bath, in the bath she was shaking, it was not until she raised her body temperature high enough that her body was like okay, it could let go a little bit, then she got into bed and the shaking started again. She stated she had to use her heating blanket and stayed in bed all night with it and she is still using it now. She doesn&#39;t know how she would be if she wasn&#39;t warm, she thinks the fact that she is warm, the shaking has subsided. Later, last night, around 2 or 3 the headache was piercing, her head was hurting so bad like someone was taking a nail in her left temple. If it was a stroke she would have dealt with it if she had someone there with her to help her deal with it. She has a horrible headache today. The patient stated that now it is like a regular migraine. It sounded crazy to say , but now it she stated that it was like a regular migraine, it has improved and no longer feels like she is having a stroke. The patient took two Tylenol yesterday for the headache and vomited pretty quickly after so she doesn&#39;t think she got much of it. She has not taken anything else because she does not have anything on her stomach so she does not want to take more Advil or whatever but she would like to, her head hurts really bad, she would love some pain relief. The projectile vomiting went until there was just bile. She did not eat very much yesterday. She is no longer actively vomiting, but she felt herself wanting to dry heave but feels there is nothing else to give. The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t eaten anything today so she does not know if she can keep anything down and doesn&#39;t have much water in her system. The outcome of the event headache was recovering while the outcome of other events was unknown. Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Everything was fine the first day but by the afternoon of day 2 I was bleeding extremely heavy and several very large blood clots past in a matter of minutes. I called consulting nurse who told me to go to the ER immediately. I then went to the ER for treatment. They did some tests and sent me home and told me to watch my symptoms closely for the next few days. This was last night and I have no change today. I&#39;m still bleeding very heavily and passing large clots. I have never in my life experienced a period of this nature.

She started getting progressively more shortness of breath. Twice, she called the nurse line for her doctor and was advised to go to the emergency room. Added she could not catch her breath, and it was worse at night, could not sleep, so she went to the emergency room, she was in emergency room for 2 and a half hours and then went home. She wanted to know if the second dose could cause issues or if she should get it, added that the paperwork said that people should not get the vaccine if they received an adverse reaction to the first dose or any vaccination. She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. She was not sure whether progressively worsening shortness of breath had gotten any better or was still going on, added that yesterday was the day she did not need either treatment medication. The day before, she took just the anxiety medicine and not the albuterol. Yesterday, she took none. During the day on 11Apr2021 (Sunday), she had called because she was feeling uncomfortable constantly. She has two children and all day she did not feel well. She told her husband she did not feel well at all. Sunday when she went to lay down, she could not sleep. Patient reported that as her shortness of breath subsided, her arm started hurting again, thought this began on 19Apr2021 and was not sure, it went away completely and was just at the injection site, probably lasting half a day or so and then it went away, clarified as left arm, same as injection. Caller added that 15Apr2021 was after the ER visit, was that she was standing up doing things and from her knee down felt tingly. Stated that knee down felt tingly on 15Apr2021, which was after her ER visit occurred, she was standing up and doing things. She had not been doing things for long periods but her knee down felt tingly. Added not like numb, but like her legs were falling asleep. She was preparing dinner and moving around and felt tingling in both legs. This probably lasted about three hours. She just kind of took it easy and it started to subside and then it was gone. While mentioned investigations, patient stated the ER did an EKG, where they put stickers and monitor her heart. They did a chest x-ray, and they took blood. She believed they checked for blood clot tests and anemia. Patient did not know any results but stated the doctor came into the room and told her everything was clear and nothing came back with anything on it. She stated the date was either the night of 11Apr2021 or the morning of 12Apr2021 for the tests.

                                                I gave birth to a healthy baby boy who was 4 weeks early on 5/10/21.  I had developed severe preeclampsia the week prior and had to be induced.  The baby weight 6lbs 140z. I developed a pulmonary embolism on 5/14, just four days after delivering. I do not take birth control pills nor have I ever smoked. I do not have a personal or family history of blood clots. I was in the hospital from 5/14-5/16 for management of the PE.   I am now on blood thinners for at least 3 months.  The doctors are not positive as to where the clot came from, but think possibly the ovarian vein which is very rare.  CT scan did not show any active thrombus, just signs of inflammation to that are. Bilateral lower extremity Doppler ultrasounds were negative.  I will be worked up by hematology to make sure I do not have a clotting disorder as a clot from the ovarian vein is so rare.

About 5/10/2021 I did not get my menstrual cycle when expected.  I am relatively very regular.   On 6/16/2021, I had light spotting that day. On 6/27/2021 I did get my period.  It was heavier than normal and lasted 3 days.   My last normal period was in March 2021. So I basically did not get a period for 3.5 months.  I am going to follow up with OBGYN and my appointment is on 7/28/2021 in 2 weeks.

Also gradually within an hour, my left side of my mouth (cheek, bottom lip, gums) went completelt numb. That last until Saturday then it became tingly like for the next few days after that. I was able to use facial muscles, I just literally had no feeling.    My heart started to have palpitations and I am pretty sure it went into AFib until Friday.  I also felt like I had vertigo for the first 24 hours. I could not keep balance like I was very intoxicated.  With my endometriosis, it did also cause a d Flare up in my back pelvic area like my endo has returned to my &#34;cal de sac&#34; area. That lasted a few days too.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0191), intramuscular, administered in Deltoid Right on 25Jun2021 15:00 (at age of 36 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Rheumatoid arthritis from 2006 ongoing (She was diagnosed at 21. 15 years before 2021. She thinks 2006), compromised immune status, Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s): Mother has a history of stoke. She is only saying that because she had thought she herself had a TIA. That is why she went in because her arm was so numb. Her arm was numb Sunday through Monday. So she thought she better go and get it checked out. Fortunately there was no PE or evidence of stroke or anything. With her mom&#39;s medical history she thought she should get it checked out. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) No, but she had a varicella booster on 21May2021 (at 36 years old). She had to put off her vaccine to make sure she waited the full month before the Pfizer vaccine. No AEs following prior vaccinations. Caller is calling regarding the COVID vaccine. She is reporting an adverse reaction to the first shot which she had on Friday at 3pm. Caller had to go to emergency department last night. She has a small pericardial effusion on 29Jun2021. It was very bizarre. She has never had any kind of adverse reaction to a vaccine before. She is calling because she feels like Pfizer needs to know. After she received the shot everything was fine, she just had soreness in her arm, no big deal. Then Sunday (27Jun2021) she had a syncope event where she almost lost consciousness and simultaneously her right arm went completely numb. Her right arm lost function and went completely flaccid. She had no voluntary control over her right arm. It went completely numb and she could not move it. soreness in right arm: Arm was very sore probably Friday (25Jun2021) and Saturday morning. She took some Ibuprofen and it was completely fine. She no longer felt pain by Saturday (26Jun2021) night. She no longer was feeling any kind of muscle pain from the injection. Caller clarifies that the soreness was in her muscle where the injection was. The muscle pain and soreness are the same thing caller further clarifies. It wasn&#39;t anything. It happened. The pericardial effusion was actually last night. It is probably the last one in the order of events. She states she found that out yesterday, actually early this morning. Probably 2am since she was in the Emergency Department forever. This is probably something that will need follow up with an echocardiogram and monitoring and possible medication. It&#39;s ok right now but if fluid keeps accumulating it can be lethal and would require a surgery to take the fluid off of the heart. Pericardial effusion is a small amount of fluid that builds up around the heart. The sack that holds your heart muscle, it builds up in-between there. She went to the hospital because of the adverse reactions she was having with the syncope and the numbness in the arm and that is what they discovered. The small pericardial effusion is what her scan found. Caller clarifies that she was not admitted to the hospital. Caller states that the fact that the syncope and numbness in her arm happened together is medically significant. If these things happen on their own it is one thing, but if they happen together that is medically significant that they happen simultaneously. They are less significant on their own than if they happened together. The right arm numbness did not resolve with the syncope. She regained function of her arm but she had numbness and tingling until yesterday. Today it feels much better. Caller states she wanted the Pfizer because that was her pick between that and Moderna. She preferred the Pfizer. She researched about it. She is just sad that she had an adverse reaction. She hopes no one else is having that, that is why she wanted to call to inform Pfizer. Reporter seriousness for Right arm went completely numb: Medically significant. The patient was hospitalized for Syncope and Right arm went completely numb on unknown date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included D dimer: Elevated to 1.14 in 2021, scan: pericardial effusion on 29Jun2021. AE (except D dimer: Elevated) require a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome of the event Syncope was recovered on 27Jun2021, for Numbness of upper arm, Tingling was recovered on 28Jun2021, for Pericardial effusion was not recovered, for Pain in arm, Vaccination site pain, muscle pain was recovered on 26Jun2021, for other events was unknown. Relatedness of drug to reactions/events: For soreness in right arm was Related, for small pericardial effusion was Unknown, for Syncope was Related, for Right arm went completely numb was Related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information in the case, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events syncope ,hypoaesthesia and pericardial effusion.

                                                Approximately a week after I received the covid vaccine, I missed my period by 6 days. I then started to spot on may 15 for about a month. On June 12th I started to have extremely heavy menstrual cycle with large clots. I went to my doctor and they prescribed me progesterone to stop it. It slowed it down to spotting again and a week later I was back to extreme bleeding with large clots. I went to the ER on June 29 where they prescribed me a larger dose of progesterone to stop the bleeding. On July 3rd I was still spotting. I continued to spot until July 18 and began heavy bleeding with clots again. I have continued taking the progesterone to help stop the bleeding but it has not helped. I have alerted my doctor and the ER that it was shortly after I had the vaccine I started this problem. I have never had irregular bleeding during my menstrual cycle and my menstrual cycle has always been consistent.

                                                I had the first dose before I found out I was pregnant. I continued with the pregnancy and I went for the first ultrasound. I had to start coming in weekly. The following week I should have been at 7 weeks but the baby was only 6 weeks 5 days and had a heartbeat by then. The next week the baby did not grow and did not have a heartbeat. The following Monday they prescribed a medication for forced my body to eject the fetus. I had an allergic reaction to that medication. I continued bleeding for 11 days which was supposed to be 3 days. At that time it was all clear. We do not know if I would be able to conceive again. I had a shot of RhoGAM because I have an RH factor. Pregnancy- one birth one miscarriage, my daughter is 2 years old with no complications. Estimated date was 01/21/2022. I did not know I was pregnant until a week after getting the vaccine and the nurse advised me not to take the second dose.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient mother). A 36-years-old female patient received bnt162b2(PFIZER-BIOTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunization (Vaccinated at 36 years age). Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient&#39;s mother reported that her daughter received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction on an unspecified date in Mar2021 and she was concerned and wanted to know information about her walking around not being fully vaccinated and with the delta variant. She would like to know how protected was her daughter after receiving one dose of the vaccine and to the variant. She wanted to know if there is a pathway for full vaccination with the Pfizer covid vaccine after someone had an anaphylactic reaction to the first dose. She stated under a hospital setting is there a clinical study to support administering a smaller amount. Stated that she talked to (withheld) and thought there would be a study regarding this but she understands that not a lot of people had an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. On follow-up on 13Jul2021 she reported that anaphylaxis shock was confirmed by the doctor and she was fine. Patient mother was wondering if there are any other clinical trials. Her daughter was walking around half vaccinated and she was concerned. Patient was taken to a research hospital and they handled the report at hand and verified her adverse event, did not clarified if daughter was actually hospitalized. No further details provided. The outcome for the event was reported as unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested. Further Information was expected.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She underwent Covid test/ Nasal swab post vaccination on 09Jan2021, pending result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pneumonia was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

As soon as I got the shot I could feel a degranulation and tightening in my throat, but I did not need to use my epi-pen. I did use my inhaler. After about 15 minutes the allergic reaction subsided, and after 30 minutes I felt well enough to go home.

Next, I was feeling tingling in my extremities. Then like the flick of a switch, I went into anaphylactic shock. I couldn&#39;t breathe and struggled to get the words out to get an epi pen. I was then injected with 3 epi pens while the ambulance was called. I also felt tingling in my tongue and mouth. The following day at home, I had another reaction. It started with tingling in my throat then the shallow breathing again. Chest pains again, then anaphylactic shock again. The next day, allergy symptoms came back, but not anaphylactic shock. This time, the addition of burning in my biceps on both sides, which traveled down to my forearms. Later on, the burning traveled down my torso to my legs. There is also some burning in my ears and scalp. My breathing is shallow, and it seems like when the allergy meds start to wear off, the symptoms keep coming back. They&#39;re happening now as I write this

She then began having a seizure and was placed on to the ground. One dose of EpiPen was given to her and she regained consciousness.

                                                First shot: 7 hours after my first dose I experienced low fever 100.2 that last 2 days as well as chills. Severe pain in my left arm that subsided in about 24 hours. In addition , the first 48 hours I couldn&#39;t sleep. Slept 3 hours those nights despite feeling extremely tired. Brain fog and severe fatigue persisted for a full 7 days after the first shot.   Second shot: 12 hours after my second dose, around 10 pm that night sudden onset of fever, this time higher, rose to 101. Severe chills, nausea, diarrhea. These severe, flu-like symptoms lasted a little over 24 hours and then improved significantly. However, the stomach pains continued and the next morning (so about 24 hours after the second shot), I had heavy vaginal bleeding and cramping. This happened 21 days into my cycle and is highly abnormal for me. My cycle is regular and runs between 28 and 31 days, usually on the longer side. I track my periods, in the last 3 years it&#39;s never been 21 days and I&#39;ve never had sudden onset of heavy bleeding like this, it always starts lighter and intensifies. Heavy bleeding continues as I&#39;m writing this report. This is much heavier than usual for the full 6 days so far and seems to be getting heavier, not lighter as I would expect it to by day 6/7 certainly.

A 37-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 37-year-old, on 04Feb2021 16:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior. Concomitant medication included ongoing drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (DROSPIRENONE/ETHINYLESTRADIOL) taken for contraception.  The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL3302) single dose, at the age of 37-year-old, on 14Jan2021 1500PM in the left arm, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced fatigue and a sore arm. On 05Feb2021, the patient experienced fatigue, sore arm, mild chills, and body aches. On 08Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized because of vertebral artery dissection after an intense workout that morning/ she tore a vertebral artery in her neck which she immediately clotted and led to her having a stroke. The patient had vertigo, nausea and weakness on 08Mar2021 and went to the ER and they found she had a thrombolytic stroke in the cerebellum as a result of the vertebral artery dissection. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 08Mar2021 then she was discharged 11Mar2021. While she was in the hospital, they did an MRI and found two sub-acute thrombolytic strokes or blood clots in her brain. The patient tore the artery in her neck which led to the right cerebellar stroke; her blood was really clotty but they could tell by the imaging that the two subacute blood clots that led to having the other two strokes were there approximately three weeks before but not much older than that (without exhibiting symptoms, so she had three thrombotic strokes in total). Since she was discharged she has been out of work and will be on FML for two to three months and going to physical therapy from the effects of the strokes. Adds while she was in the hospital they were trying to determine the cause of the two sub-acute strokes that were unrelated to the dissection. They did several tests including: EKG which was normal; TEE scope down her throat to look at her heart which was normal; and blood work to check for a clotting disorder which was also all normal.  So far nothing has been found. Outcome of mild chills, body aches, and sore arm was recovered on 06Mar2021; outcome of vertebral artery dissection and right cerebellar stroke was recovering; while it was unknown for the other events.

I have carried 2 out of 3 children to over 8 months, the first a live birth (greater than 7 lb) and the second ended in stillbirth (also greater than 7 lb). I have no history of miscarriage. This was my third pregnancy. I became pregnant in March with positive tests on 4/19, 4/20, and 4/21. I had the Covid vaccine 4/21 and by 4/23 was suddenly in pain and bleeding, which continued for six days, after which my body began to recover. Additionally, I began to suffer breathing trouble, waking in the night, heart pounding (no nightmares or fears) and gasping. Was prescribed two inhalers to recover.

                                                The next day I started to feel strange and had a racing heart and some leg pain. Slowly over the course of four days (Friday to Monday) I continually felt &#34;off&#34; but differently than others explained post-vaccine (not necessarily flu like). This was an extremely high heart rate (up to 130&#43;) and palpitations, chect pains, and calf discomfort. Finally on Monday, March 1, I went to my primary doctor because I felt so off and I knew something was wrong.  My doctor sent me to the ER where they found a new DVT in my upper leg. This time it was deemed unprovoked, though it was right after the second vaccine.

A 37-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included etonogestrel (NEXPLANON); levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXIN); cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY); fluticasone propionate (FLONASE ALLERGY RELIEF), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 04Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number: EN6206) for COVID-19 immunization. On 28Apr2021 at 14:30, the patient experienced heavy bleeding including passing a blood clot with her first cycle after my second dose. The have NEVER bleed like this except for when she was having a miscarriage or postpartum after giving birth to her daughters. She usually can go all day with the same pad and soaked through a pad and her underwear was completely bloody in 3 hours (it was so bad I discarded the underwear). When she got on the toilet it kept gushing out and that was when she passed a clot. After that the bleeding slowed down. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient did not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.

                                                pulmonary embolism; Also developed flare of viral myelitis symptoms; dyspnea; This is a spontaneous report. A 37-year-old female patient (non-pregnant at time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 17Apr2021 at 12:00 PM as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroid, migraines, viral myelitis from Nov2019, allergies to bee stings. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); magnesium glycinate; ascorbic acid, calcium pantothenate, calcium phosphate dibasic, colecalciferol, copper sulfate, cyanocobalamin, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, ferrous fumarate, magnesium oxide, manganese sulfate, nicotinamide, potassium iodide, potassium sulfate, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, thiamine mononitrate, zinc oxide (MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL) . The patient previously took prochlorperazine (COMPAZINE SPANSULE) and experienced allergies. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No covid prior vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient did not diagnose with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient developed dyspnea 4 days after vaccine (on 21Apr2021 at 12:00 PM) and diagnosed with pulmonary embolism 2 wks later. Also developed flare of viral myelitis symptoms which had been improving and almost resolved for 2mos prior. The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization (with one day hospitalization), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Lab data included covid tested post vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 test (Nasal Swab) on 06May2021 was negative. Treatment received for the adverse event including blood thinners. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I could not catch my breath and my heart was ?resting? at approximately 145 beats per minute.  I went to the local ER at which time I was taken back for testing, approximately 10 hours later I was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary embolism. My legs were checked and they could not locate any other blood clots - just in my lungs.

A 37-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 4:00 pm (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There are no patient history and concomitant medications. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. Patient is healthy. She hasn&#39;t had vaccines since she was a child. Patient experienced unexpected menstrual period from 13Apr2021 and ongoing. Caller thought she was having a side effect to the COVID vaccine. She was having unexpected vaginal bleeding. She got the Pfizer COVID vaccine, first dose. Caller declined email. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. This was the first dose. She got the first dose on 07Apr2021, and then started bleeding the 13Apr2021. She thought it was gone last night, but then this morning it is more like a menstrual period. She had her period for 6 days, and it ended 4 days ago. Her period ended. She has never had unexpected bleeding. Her period was always on time and normal. She was pretty sure it was another period. It was weird because she felt like her breast were sensitive and more larger like when she got her period. She was confused for 2 days because she didn&#39;t understand why she felt like that. Then, she started bleeding. She scheduled her second dose. She has misplaced the card with the NDC/lot/expiration. She only has her receipt. She would like to know the ingredients of the vaccine. No emergency room and physician office visit. But she was going to the doctor Friday to talk to her. No investigation assessment. No relevant tests. The event outcome for unexpected menstrual period was not recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 37-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 18Mar2021 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Strawberries. Concomitant medications included muscle relaxers, and anti-inflammatory. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6200) on 24Feb2021 14:00 in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Shortly after, maybe a week, after getting the second dose patient experienced a bump under her skin in the left arm on 01Apr2021 16:00. Over the last few weeks more painful bumps had appeared. Most of these hard lumps were in her left hand. She had one that she knew of in her right hand. Patient met with her PC doctor and the doctor sent her for X rays and ultrasound. Every tech and doctor that had looked at her hands had never seen anything like this. These masses had been confirmed with the ultrasound and more were found during that visit. Patient was moving forward with getting a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her hands. Patient was leaning towards calcified blood clots (01Apr2021 16:00), however that had not been confirmed yet. Adverse events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Nasal swab on 24Apr2021 was negative. Treatment was received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events was not resolved.  Information about lot/batch number was available. Further information was expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a causal association between the reported event and BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. Case will be reassessed when additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and investigators, as appropriate.

I got an ultrasound and they baby was fine and there was no bleeding in utero. I saw my OBGYN. On June 24th 2021 I experienced more vaginal bleeding. Once again I was in the clear, had an ultrasound, baby healthy and all. This is my second pregnancy, I became pregnant with my first in October 2019, I had no issues or complications at all. My first child was 7 lbs 6 ounces. My due date for this baby is January 2, 2022.

But after the vaccine, my chronic pain and heavy bleeding came back again.  I had my vaccine second dose of vaccine on March 24, 2021.  1st period - Mar 30, 2021 - started to feel an increase in pain during the period but not that much. There was no change in bleeding volume but the bleeding length lengthened from 4 days (before the vaccine) to 7 days. 2nd period - Apr 28, 2021 - there was an increased in bleeding volume and more clots, also an increased in pain level up to 7/10. Bleeding and spotting lasted for 12 days. 3rd period - May 1, 2021 - my cycle shortened to 25 days only. The bleeding less heavy, less clots compared to April, but the pain level still up to 7/10.  Bleeding and spotting lasted for 8 days 4th period - Jun 11, 2021 - my cycle shortened to 19 days only. The bleeding was less heavy, and the pain down to around 5-6/10. The bleeding and spotting lasted for 7-8 days. 5th period - Jul 9, 2021 - 28 days cycle. Very heavy bleeding , pain level increased to 8/10 and intense fow the whole day on day 2 with no relieve from ibuprofen, cbd oil, and valerian root. I&#39;m still bleeding at the moment making this report.  Overal, I have pain almost daily now. I only have pain free days for 1 week last month. This is bad!

ED physician documentation on 19 Jul 2021: &#34;37-year-old female came the emergency department after found down by her husband.  Has a history of attempted overdose in the past,, she was found down by her husband at 545, and unresponsive on scene.  Medic was on scene and patient was noted to be in V. fib and therefore CPR was started, compressions were in progress upon arrival, however the patient remained in cardiac arrest.  Other history was able to be gathered from the patient or family, however EMS stated that they had found that her glucose was 99 on scene, and she been given full dose Narcan as well on scene.  And was shocked 3 times a 200 J, she was given 2 doses of epinephrine, as well as 300 of amiodarone.  They attempted to intubate the patient however the patient was clamped down, and therefore they could not pass any sort of apparatus to control the airway, therefore they placed a nasal trumpet. Pertinent physical exam findings: Jaw clamped shut, pupils fixed, and was obviously cyanotic, no palpable pulses.  No chest rise. EKG as interpreted by me (ED attending): Monitor showed that the patient was in asystole the entire time. Medical Decision making and plan of care: Patient was immediately moved from gurney onto bed, and chest compressions were continued without interruption.  Given that the patient was in V. fib in the field, we did decide to place dual pads for dual sequential defibrillation, is on the plats however, the patient was noted to be in asystole, therefore chest compressions were continued, epinephrine, as well as calcium, as well as bicarb. See code chart for further details. IO was also placed in the patient&#39;s left proximal tibia.  Regarding the patient&#39;s airway, several attempts were made to pass an ET tube, as well as paralyzed the patient with rocuronium, however tube passing was unsuccessful, and therefore I performed a cricothyrotomy.  Followed by bilateral finger thoracostomies.  See procedure notes below for further details.   Despite 5 rounds of ACLS, with multiple doses of epinephrine, as well as bicarb and calcium carbonate administered, the patient remained in cardiac arrest, death was declared at 1851.&#34;

It&#39;s brown or red - it fluctuates in color back and forth. It is like post surgical bleeding (almost like post partum bleeding). Usually about a week before my period and at least a week to two weeks after. I go without any spotting only 5 days or so in the month. That has been going on for at least 6 months. I got started on Metformin to see if that would help with my trying to get pregnant but nothing has been given to me with the spotting/bleeding issue. This last cycle it went to day 15 of this one.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

A 39 years old female patient (no pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899), intramuscular on 16Dec2020 10:15 at the first single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000).  The patient experienced rught MCA stroke on 25Dec2020 06:15. Seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization, life threatening. The patient was hospitalized for rught MCA stroke for 3 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 25Dec2020.  The patient received unspecified treatment  for rught MCA stroke.

A 38-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 13:00 at single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included heart attack from Apr2019 to an unknown date, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date (really sick with it). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient got the first COVID19 vaccine and a few days after started having chest pain on 02Jan2021 at 1:00AM, event was serious per medically significant. She went to the doctor and they did an EKG on 08Jan2021. The EKG said she had a heart attack. The heart attack was about the time she had chest pain after the first injection. Patient called her doctor on Monday, 04Jan2021. She had a televideo appointment on 06Jan2021. She went to the doctor&#39;s office and had EKG on 08Jan2021 and was sent to the hospital. She didn&#39;t get admitted because there were no beds. Outcome of the event chest pain, she would say she had recovered on 02Jan2021 with lasting effects because she was in the hospital again for the same thing. She went to the hospital the second time for chest pain that woke her up on 11Jan2021. It started at like 3AM. She thought it was heart burn. She tried to go back to sleep. It continued while she was at work. She told her supervisor who sent her to the hospital. They did not admit her. They did do an EKG on 11Jan2021 and it was abnormal, but not indicative of heart attack. Thought it was gastritis. Her doctor thought the heart attack was on the 02Jan2021. The same thing happened with her heart and she had a heart attack in Apr2019. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient stated she didn&#39;t go to the ER, but called doctor&#39;s office on the following Monday. There was no adverse event following prior vaccinations. Outcome of event chest pain was recovered with sequel, and outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the events chest pain and heart attack cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying cardiovascular conditions.

This was confirmed many times by EKGs and lasted 4.5 hours with HR ranging from 8-173 at rest. I was given a medication, Diltiazem 30 mg tab, and my heart rate regulated. Many tests were completed at ER and so far, no known cause for this event has been determined based on test findings. So symptoms lasted from 5pm to 9:45pm. Given medication which resolved the Afib. Stayed at ER running tests until 3:30am.

I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.  I do not have a cardiac history.&#34;

The patient medical history included five weeks postpartum; concomitant medications were not reported. On 19Mar2021 the patient experienced bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery that was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. These events required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and were described as follows: patient was five weeks postpartum and was exclusively breastfeeding the newborn. Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

                                                Lethargy, impaired cognitive function began on 3/29.  By the morning of 3/30, the lethargy and cognitive function is back to normal. Slight headache, low fever and slight chest pain began. Felt better by the afternoon of 3/30 once I took ibuprofen. That evening at approximately 7 pm, I noticed my heart rate was high. My resting HR is about 70, but my HR was at 125 - 130 and I was not exerting myself and was sitting. My HR remained high after I went to bed, and chest pain became worse. By 12:30 am on 3/31, chest pain was getting severe and had pain in both arms. Went to ER at around 3 am on 3/31. Later learning I had a mild heart attack. Had EKG, Blood work, ECG, and Heart Catheritazion. No blockage and normal results except blood work. Blood work showed elevated enzymes.  While in the ER, I was given blood thinner and glycerin tablets, aspirin. Since 4/2, my heart rate and blood pressure have returned to their norm without medication.  I once again have perfect blood pressure readings and perfect HR.  I have returned to normal daily activities as of 4/4.

I was vaccinated Monday afternoon and by Tuesday night I started bleeding.  To put it into perspective I generally use 1 panty liner a day of the usually 2 maybe 2 days I lightly spot.  But I have been using 6 or so panty liners a day since then and it&#39;s Thursday night.  So this is highly irregular for my regularity.

A 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) on 31Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on an unspecified date. The event resulted in the Emergency room/department or urgent care. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of both events [rivaroxaban (XARELTO). The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug profile and available information it  is unlikely that the reported deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary  embolism were causally  related to BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  medical  conditions.   Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My menstrual cycles are entirely controlled via estradiol patches (changed 2 times a week) and a Mirena intrauterine device. Approximately 19 hours post-vaccine, I began off-cycle, irregular bleeding from my vagina. The bleeding was light (did not fill a tampon) and lasted approximately 24 hours. I experienced NO other symptoms that I typically experience with withdrawal bleeding (e.g., cramping, lower back pain, headache).  This off-cycle menstrual bleeding was in addition to chills, fever (101.0ºF), severe headache, fatigue, and generalized body aches that I experienced beginning 4 hours post-vaccine and lasted through hour 47 post-vaccine.

I also stopped ovulating and my hormone levels were off. The following month I had a period that wouldn&#39;t stop. I starting taking birth control again to reset my cycle. This was my first period on the pill and I shed an entire uterine cast along with seven plus days of heavy bleeding with clotting. Its would not stop so I had to double my doses of birth control for over three days to make it slow down.

                                                Patient mentioned when she came for her 2nd COVID vaccine that she had some pain in her inner thigh up to her groin (on the same side as her shot) that started soon after her 1st dose and lasted about 4 hours. She also started bleeding 4 hours after her shot and this lasted for about 6 hours along with some mild cramping. She did not report this after the 1st dose because she didn&#39;t really know if it was related to her vaccine or not.  After receiving her 2nd dose she started having some  pain in her ankle that went to her shin and lasted about 2 hours. She also had some mild cramping right after the shot. She called the pharmacy later to report that she started bleeding again 4 hours after the shot. The bleeding was off and on for the rest of the night and into the next morning.  She has  a Mirena IUD for birth control and hasn&#39;t had a period in years. She did contact her OBGYN after the 2nd shot and her MD had not heard of any of these reactions with any patients with the Mirena IUD.

It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included asthma, shellfish allergy, allergy lobster (used steroids). Patient was not pregnant.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Previously on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM patient took the first dose of the vaccine (Lot EJ1685) at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization and couple of days after she had nausea and something stuck in her throat. On 11Jan2021, 5 minutes after the 2nd dose (at 11:05), the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, that required Emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLUMEDROL) and &#34;Pepcid&#34;: she was prescribed 3-day course of oral prednisone and H2 antihistamine oral &#34;Pepcid&#34;. After finished it, she felt it was coming back therefore she took diphenhydramine hydrochloride for 2 nights in a row. She did not experience any respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestation. She completely recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of anaphylactic reaction  due to temporal relationship.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I began feeling short of breath after doing minor tasks in my own (doing laundry, walking up steps, etc.)  during the  2nd week after my covid vaccination. On the morning of April 10th I awoke to feeling severely winded as if I had run 18 marathons just to walk up 3 steps or to walk across a room.  I was taken to the ER where they performed a catscan on me and could see that my lungs were ?full? of blood clots and I was experiencing a pulmonary embolism.  I do not smoke, take birth control pills, I do not drink.  There is no family history of clotting, nor did any traumatic incident happen within the last two weeks to cause this.

                                                Mild anaphylaxis--tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway; This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot was unknown due to not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at age of 39-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eczema, known allergies: Food sensitives including gluten and dairy. Rashes with prolonged skin contact with metals or adhesives. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID was not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylaxis-tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway on 19Mar2021. Started about 2min after shot. Occlusion lasted for 7minutes. EMS said vitals were normal. Swollen tongue lasted 24 hours. Have never had an allergic response to any vaccine before. The events were non-serious. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of anaphylaxis was recovered in 2021, of tongue swelling was recovered on 20Mar2021, of occlusion of airway was recovered on 19Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event anaphylaxis cannot be totally excluded.

I contacted my doctor via the online message system and advised her of the spotting. She instructed me to rest and take fluids.  - Second adverse event on 09/13/21 (17 weeks, 3 days pregnant)- I woke up with a swollen right eye, which was crusted shut with mucus. My first thought was that it was either debris in my eye or pink eye. I made an appointment with the eye doctor and he said that it&#39;s likely a stye forming and to use a warm compress.  - Third adverse event on 09/16/21 (17 weeks, 6 days pregnant) - I tried using the bathroom to pass a stool and was finding myself a bit constipated (which hasn&#39;t been uncommon in this pregnancy). I experienced enough bleeding to have blood in the toilet and continuous blood while wiping. I went immediately to the ER for treatment.

On Saturday April 24 2021 they call me earlier morning from my doctor&#39;s office to let me know that I had to run to the emergency room because I was bleeding to death. In emergencies they tell me that my platelets were very low, the Hematology, Oncology. Asked me a series of questions to verify the reason for the loss of my platelets. He treat me with platelet infusion and iron infusion because I had anemia (Caused by the low platelets). I was hospitalized from April 24 2021 to April 26 2021, they managed to stabilize my platelets. On May 6 2021 I had another appointment with Hematology, Oncology, they did laboratory studies and in the afternoon of that same day he spoke to me to tell me that I had to go back to the emergency room because my platelets had dropped again. At the emergency room They gave me an infusion of immunoglobulin (IVIG, two bags of 1g/kg ) and more iron IV, I had to stay in the hospital from May 6 2021 to May 8 2021, they sent me steroids and they have been treating me as ITP (Immune thrombocytopenic purpura) ever since. Since that day I have to go every Friday to have my blood drawn to check the platelet count, this has all happened after I received the first dose of  pfizer vaccine of covid 19, during the time of the pandemic I have not caught COVID to date, Before this vaccine I was healthy.

Because I had an IUD, checked to ensure my IUD was in proper position on 4/26.  It was.   A few weeks later, had abnormal bleeding (starting 5/28) not associated with normal menstrual cycle and significant pain starting 6/4.  Transvaginal ultrasound showed cystic fallopian tube  vs hematosalpinx.  Workup has not shown a known cause.  It was not an ectopic pregnancy. There have been no signs/ symptoms/ exam findings lab work  consistent with PID (which would be the main cause with an IUD).   Underwent antibiotic treatment and IUD removal with continued milder intermittent pain.  Will be having a repeat US coming up to determine if it has resolved.

This was 18 June. I received my second shot on 8 June. And last week I had the same symptoms, I contacted the hematologist and he ordered another ultra sound and now I have another DVT.

A 39-years-old female patient (patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received an unknown dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, Expiration date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered at an unspecified anatomical location on 01Jul2021 at 15:00 pm (age at the vaccination was 39 years) as dose number unknown, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Ehlers Danlos. The patient did not have any known allergies. Concomitant medication the patient received within two weeks of vaccination included Amphetamine aspartate, amphetamine sulfate, dexamphetamine saccharate, dexamphetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) taken for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 01Jul2021, 2 mins after receiving the vaccine, the patient&#39;s throat started burning but never closed and she took antihistamines and went to work. 48 hours later a headache started and hives on her neck, a few hours later she became very sick. The next morning she woke up to hives all over her legs and chest pains she began to bleed heavily with large blood clots. A few days later she felt better but weeks have gone by and she was still getting hives, numbness, rib pain, she hemorrhaged for eight days and that started again yesterday. She was extremely fatigued and still had hives coming and going. She was recently having some weird vision things happening. Obviously she had an immediate allergic reaction to something but now the vaccine was not meshing well with her body and symptom. She did have ehlers danlos syndrome and she realized there was just no real studies for ED patients and the vaccine. She was just hoping to let someone know what was going on. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment with EKG, epi pen, allergist appt, opt out of 2nd dose. The outcome of the events was not resolved.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
