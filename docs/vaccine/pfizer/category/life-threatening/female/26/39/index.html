Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

As far as what happened, I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Jan. 13th @ 05:15 at hospital and started feeling symptoms roughly six hours later, symptoms being nausea, chills, splitting headaches, muscle fatigue, feeling tired and joint pain. I had understood that these side effects were common and not to worry, however, the next day on Jan. 14th around 11:00am, I blacked out at home. Luckily, my partner had caught me before I feel to the ground, but he stated that my eyes had glazed over, my breathing was shallow, and I hardly had a pulse. He was getting ready to do chest compressions, but I had come out of whatever fog that had knocked me down and became responsive. Around 12:00 pm I had arrived at the ED where they had given me a bag on NS, Zofran for the nausea and Toradol for some inflammation management. I believe I discharged from the ED around 15:20.

I had only been driving for a few minutes, maybe less than five when I felt like my arm I got the shot in started to go numb and soon followed a feeling of lightheadness. I thought about pulling off to the side but didn&#39;t make it in time because the next thing I knew I woke up pressed against the median on the other side of the freeway I was driving on. I completely blacked out while driving. I had to call an ambulance because I was freaked out and wanted to be looked at and my car needed to be towed.

A 27-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; received at a nursing home/senior living facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Medical history included COVID-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control taken for an unspecified indication from an unknown date to an unknown date; within two weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: syncope episode in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, unconscious in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, fever and chills on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, blood pressure was low, about 90/50  on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, did not feel well in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown; all of which were assessed as medically significant. The clinical course was reported as follows: the fever and chills began about one hour after vaccination (as reported). About 18 hours after the vaccination, the patient was getting up to take more paracetamol (TYLENOL) and did not feel well. The patient had a syncope episode in the bathroom (no issues as she sat on the floor before hand). The patient was unconscious for about 1-2 minutes. The patient&#39;s blood pressure several minutes later was low, about 90/50; however, the patient took the blood pressure measurement herself, so it may not have been exactly accurate. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: low, about 90/50 on 09Jan2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all reported serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                27 year old female comes in 3/27/21 at 4:15pm to get Pfizer COVID vaccine. She has no family doctor. On her VAR form she states no seizure or history of seizure but does have reaction to HPV vaccine where her throat swelled up and her MD had to give her oxygen year ago. I asked about any other reactions to any other vaccinations and she said no and was willing to get this vaccine.  I told her to wait 30 minutes after vaccination to make sure no reaction. At 4:25pm her sister and mom tell us that patient is feeling week and dizzy and ask for water, I go out and check and she is pale and is ready to faint. Mother asks for orange juice which she takes a sip. I ask her if she has any health conditions like diabetes, seizures and they say no, then patient has what looks like a petit mal (absence) seizure. While sitting in the chair her eyes flutter, roll back she tenses up and her body freezes for about 20-30 seconds. I tell staff to call 911 and her sister says she&#39;s having &#34;another&#34; seizure. We don&#39;t move her but make sure she doesn&#39;t fall, once the seizure passes we move her to the ground to lie down. She regains consciousness and is coherent but confused. I do not give EpiPen because I witnessed a seizure. The fire and ambulance arrive to assist her and then her family mentions she did have seizures years ago. After 20 minutes or around 4:50pm she feels better and does not want to go to the hospital and walks out assisted by fire/ambulance staff. The next day I call her and she says she feels better and just has a sore arm and will find new doctor check her out.

                                                My arm started to hurt , tingled and then turned into feeling very heavy as soon as injection was admitted. I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

My last period was on December 8th and I received the vaccine on Dec 30th. I developed a fever and muscle aches after the first dose, but was managed with Tylenol.  I received the second dose on January 22nd and again developed a fever that was managed by Tylenol. I began having vaginal bleeding on 24th. I had an ultrasound revealing a heartbeat on the 25th. After continually bleeding, another ultrasound a week later on Feb. 2nd confirmed a miscarriage. I&#39;ve had two healthy pregnancies prior to this one.

Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

                                                Heavy vaginal bleeding noticed a few hours after injection. I have been spotting (1 pad daily) because of my birth control, but now I?m using 6-7 pads a day and soaking through them. I?m not sure if it?s related but I?m also extremely fatigued and having chills.  Should I ask for a blood test for my platelet count?  I?ve read it is a very rare reaction for some to have lower counts.

A 28-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 28-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included autism, being nervous, passed out, and anxiety. Concomitant medications included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), quetiapine fumarate (SEROQUEL), gabapentin, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and lorazepam (ATIVAN) for being nervous. The patient received the Pfizer vaccine last Wednesday (07Apr2021) and immediately after that, at about 1:30 (unspecified), she just started having a seizure. They thought that it was more of a major response she was just having, fighting and was nervous about it, but it was kind of a different situation. The reporter has seen the patient passed out before. She did some blood test on 07Apr2021 and her sugars were fine. The reporter&#39;s concern was that they didn&#39;t know whether she should get the second one. The reporter didn&#39;t believe she got a seizure but was not sure about it. It&#39;s just that what immediately happened after she got the shot was that she passed out and they called the ambulance. After she passed out, she went to the emergency room and they did blood work on her. The reporter just did not know if they were going to let her go for the second dose because they couldn&#39;t relay if it was a seizure or a bizarre response where she just syncope and fainted. They were just thinking it was a bizarre response as it was just blood pressure drop but they were just not sure where to go from here. The patient was told to rest and intravenous fluid and something through the blood were given. The patient also experienced sore arm from 07Apr2021 for 2 days and had a low-grade fever the following day (08Apr2021). The outcome of the event sore arm was recovered on 09Apr2021 and recovered on Apr2021 for all other events.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                PE; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse. A 28-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: Ek9231), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 28 years, on 12Jan2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, angiolipoma, labral surgery to hip, drug hypersensitivity to penicillins; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE 1/20) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]); both taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced drug hypersensitivity, bactrium ds and experienced drug hypersensitivity, doxycycline and experienced drug hypersensitivity. The patient received first dose of COVID vaccine BNT162B2 (lot number= Ej1685) at the age of 28 years on 22Dec2020 on the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that 2 weeks after the second vaccine, she underwent hip labral surgery and suffered a PE on 22Feb2021. She was not sure if the vaccine could have contributed to the PE or just the surgery but wanted to report just incase. She was taking aspirin to prevent DVT&#39;s. The patient was hospitalized for pe (pulmonary embolism) for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures (DOAC) were taken as a result of pe (pulmonary embolism). The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event pulmonary embolism is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Patient&#39;s hip surgery two weeks after the vaccine might have contributed to the event onset. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 7 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started what I thought was my second period of the month. I had just finished a period 12 days earlier. I am usually 35 - 42 days between periods so this was VERY unusual for me. I had my normal period pre-vaccine Jan 4 - 9 then 7 hours after the vaccine started bleeding again from the 21-25 of January. Then again on Feb 4 - 9. I got my second vaccine while bleeding. Then again started to bleed on Feb 21 - 25. I had a doctors appointment at the end of February. I got an annual gyno exam as well as a ton of bloodwork was taken to check everything out. I was told to continue to monitor the bleeding and if it didn&#39;t stop we would do a pelvic ultrasound. Well, it didn&#39;t stop so we did and it came back normal. I had a mostly normal March with light bleeding. I thought perhaps it was getting better but no. I have had two periods in April. In fact still bleeding on round two and this is my 6th day bleeding. Periods or irregular bleeding was April 12-17 and then again on April 24 - 29 (still happening and it&#39;s the 29th). This is very scary to me as no doctors can help.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information Requested on Lot/ Batch number.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported faint was most likely due to an accident, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Upon receiving my first shot, I felt weak, and after a few days a tingly feeling in my head. Symptoms lasted for 2 weeks. After receiving the second dose, I had a fever that evening and weakness, it lasted through the next day. My right arm was sore for 2 days.  I took Advil, Tylenol, and ibuprofen (at different times). Symptoms of fever lasted two days and were gone, I was left feeling weak, it lasted for a day.  Now day 5 after I got my shot (got the last dose 1/22/2021), I have noticed some vaginal bleeding that has been going on for 2 days now (It&#39;s not the menstrual period since I had that going on a week before I got my last shot). I am wondering if there are any other women who have experienced the same reaction to their body. Kindly feel free to call me or email me with any answers. I am trying to reach my primary physician who is currently booked till February.

On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history was reported as no. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID-19 vaccine. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes omeprazole, ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (MARLISSA), venlafaxine and gabapentin from unspecified dates, received within 2 weeks of vaccination, for unspecified indication.

Patient previously took hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN) on an unspecified date and indication and had allergy. On 02Apr2021, around 10pm, patient began having chills and extreme muscle pain and spasms, and the lymph nodes in her left armpit swelled up so much that she couldn&#39;t put her arm down without extreme pain.  By midnight (03Apr2021 00:00), patient had a fever and was unable to stand unassisted. She was writhing in pain and arching uncontrollably off the bed.  She believed in hindsight that this was a seizure as she went in and out of consciousness and her tongue swelled up, making it hard to breathe and impossible to speak. She was sweating profusely, and had to drink water constantly.  Her husband had to help her get to the bathroom because she couldn&#39;t support her own body without tipping over.  The chills and fever alternated all night, and she finally passed out from exhaustion at 03Apr2021 at 7am. The next 2 days, she was in a cycle of fever and chills again, and the fever got so bad that she seized twice more on Saturday (03Apr2021).  She had to take the day off work on Monday (05Apr2021) as she was still in so much pain that she could barely leave bed except to use the bathroom. Events were reported as life-threatening, immediate risk of death from the events. Patient was not hospitalized. Treatment for the adverse events were cool baths, naproxen (ALEVE) for fever and pain, and PEDIALYTE. COVID-19 was not tested post vaccination. Vaccination facility type was at a hospital. The outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 29-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: PAA165969, expiry date not reported), intramuscular, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 10:30 as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if patient had known allergies or other medical history. It was unknown if patient had Covid prior vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of the vaccination and report. It was unknown if patient received other vaccine in four weeks and other medications in two weeks. The patient received the vaccine at the doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient fainted five minutes after the vaccination on 07Apr2021 10:30. She was pale and diaphoretic. She became responsive within one minute. She was given water and a cold compress, and reported she felt better, but then vomited a small amount of emesis 15 minutes later (07Apr2021). She was evaluated by the physician who determined it was an emotional response to the vaccine. The patient had reported she was extremely anxious about receiving the vaccine (07Apr2021), and had fainted when she tried to give blood, and hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day. After sitting for 45 minutes, the doctor felt comfortable letting her leave. A call was placed to the patient at 4:00 pm to check on her. She reported she felt fine. The patient received no treatment for the event vomited, while therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the other reported events. It was unknown if patient was tested for Covid post vaccination. The patient recovered on an unspecified date in 2021 from the events reported.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of syncope. The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

The male nurse came over and started seeing signs of profuse sweating as water began dripping from all over my body. 5 minutes after that I started heaving and gasping for air unaroused next to the nurse as he took my blood pressure. Blood pressure dropped to 85/76. I started breathing heavy, sweating uncontrollably and couldn?t talk or stand. I remained hardly alert and almost passed out due to weakness.

She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

My face felt &#34;buzzy&#34; but didn&#39;t swell and I did not have significant itching. I have had similar reactions in the past to cleaning products and pesticides and usually take a benadryl, though I do carry an epipen and had one with me at the time. Instead of going back in the convention center for medical attention I took a benadryl and waited in the parking garage for about an hour and felt the throat restriction ease a bit. About 10 hours later around 8pm the tightness came back suddenly over about 10 minutes and I took another benadryl. The next morning around 7am I had one more round of tightening and took one more benadryl, and it stopped after that. I told my doctor about it a few days later.

Before she could go sit down she passed out. She later woke up on the floor, got up and threw up. Since then her neck and shoulders area has been more tense and tight than normal. She says that other than muscle tension she feels &#34;back to normal&#34; now (three days later).

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

The she got 2nd dose on 07Mar2021, and experienced nose is bleeding and vaginal bleeding again.Then it was added she completed both; and keeps having irregular bleeding. she received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination 17Feb2021 at an unknown time in the left arm. On that day she noticed irregular bleeding, spotting. Mentioned she has had her tubes tied in the past and so she called her gynecologist who made an appointment for her.

I was doing fine until toward the end of day 3. I was expecting my period to stop as it always does on 3rd day  but I started bleeding heavier that day there after. It didn?t worry me much until I started discharging huge blood clots  as big as an apple 2 times every after 30 mins from that moment.   I rushed to the ER later that night(still bleeding heavily with blood clots every now and then) but I was not admitted since my vitals and the blood counts were normal at that moment.   I went back home  and hoped the bleeding would stop but again with on pain or fever what so ever I kept bleeding all day. This is my 5th day of bleeding. Then on Sunday morning, I still kept bleeding heavy and I was too weak that I went back to the ER again.   This time , (day 6) I got admitted because I have had lost a lot of blood and I needed blood transfusion. My HB dropped from 11.3 to 6.7 and it went further down to 5 something. I got 3 units of blood transfusion in the ER. They did ultrasound, CT scans(with and without contrast) and still couldn?t figure out the cause of the bleeding. My uterus showed no problems but my body was not even responding to Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. So the doctor proceeded with an angiogram and did an emergency uterine artery Embolization to stop the blood supply to the uterus. The bleeding stopped there after and I started regaining my vitals.  However, the cause of the bleeding still remains unknown.

A 30-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 06Apr2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0150) as 1st dose, single, at the age of 30-years-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical/family history and concomitant medications. The patient went to go get her second shot of Pfizer covid vaccine but they wouldn&#39;t give it to her based on her reactions to the first dose. They said there was a chance of anaphylaxis reaction to the second shot. The patient reported blacking out, diarrhea, sweating and unable to talk. She consulted with her healthcare professional regarding whether to get the second shot and they didn&#39;t know. She asked if her reactions were normal. She doesn&#39;t know what to do whether to get a second shot given her reaction. It was mentioned that the patient was hard to hear at times. She got the vaccine on 06Apr2021 around noon and she was fine until around 3:30 am. She woke up in horrible pain from head to toe, she thought maybe she just needed to pee, she didn&#39;t know what was going on. She stood up and she blacked out like she was about to faint. She couldn&#39;t see anything, like it was completely black. She got to bathroom and she couldn&#39;t breathe at all, she couldn&#39;t talk. She thought she needs to go to the hospital, but she couldn&#39;t talk. Her face turned green, she had diarrhea, she was like dripping wet. At this point, she could sort of breathe. She felt like she was being held under water, still dripping sweat. She has recovered completely from these symptoms. The severity of symptoms was so severe she doesn&#39;t know if she had a fever at the same time, it was hard to tell. With the breathing part, she was so freaked out by that, so it&#39;s hard to know for sure, maybe yes. She may have had a low fever. She had a fever that night to the point where she was dripping on the floor. She has aching in her legs. She went to the doctor thinking she had Lyme disease, which she doesn&#39;t. Since that vaccine, she&#39;s had very, somewhat severe leg aches and extreme exhaustion like all the time. she can hardly go to work sometimes. Everybody has days they are tired, but this was different. She had to come home at 2pm and lay down for like five hours. She stated it was persisting. She had a blood test recently and everything came back perfect on 26Apr2021. She thought she had Lyme disease because of all the symptoms she was having, and it all came back negative. She didn&#39;t exactly get turned away. They said they didn&#39;t feel comfortable giving her the second dose of vaccine. The patient stated if a nurse tells her they don&#39;t feel comfortable, she wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable until she speaks to Pfizer. The nurse told her she had to go to an allergist and rheumatologist. The nurse said the same thing, the nurse told her that she should have gone to the hospital, but she wasn&#39;t thinking at that moment. She was just at a loss of what to do. That day at the hospital, they were scared with the second vaccine that she could go into anaphylaxis and she&#39;s not sure what to do. The patient had no other vaccines administered on the same date of Pfizer suspect and no other vaccinations within 4 weeks. The event hard to hear at times started on an unknown date while other events started on 07Apr2021 and ended the same day. The outcome of the events aching in her legs and exhaustion was not recovered, hard to hear at times was unknown while for other events was recovered. The events &#34;she blacked out, like she was about to faint&#34; was assessed as serious medically significant.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information expected.

                                                Employee  received her 2nd Pfizer vaccine on 1/12/2021.  Twelve hours after her vaccine she developed a fever with a T-max of 102 degrees.  The fever lasted 18 hours.  She also complained of severe malaise and fatigue lasting 36 hours.  On day 3 (Friday, January 15, 2021) she developed left lower extremity pain that persisted over the weekend.  She was seen in Urgent Care today where she was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis of the proximal vein. She also came to the ETC and was ruled out for a PE.  The employee does have a family history of antiphospholipid in her mother. She has a follow up with her PCP and will also receive a work up in hematology as she had never been tested for any genetic coagulation conditions after her mom&#39;s diagnosis.

This healthcare professional only reported information for the mother (herself). This is the maternal case. A 31-year-old pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 11Jan2021 at 08:15 (at the age of 31-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was 05Dec2020 and the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination (5 gestation weeks) with a due date of 11Sep2021. Concomitant medications, taken within two weeks of vaccination, included ascorbic acid, betacarotene, calcium sulfate, colecalciferol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous fumarate, folic acid, nicotinamide, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol acetate, riboflavin, thiamine mononitrate, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRENATAL VITAMINS). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EJ1685) on 21Dec2020 at 09:00 (at the age of 31-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced shaking chills, light headed, and one syncopal episode on 12Jan2021 at 01:00. The pregnant female patient received the vaccine on 11Jan2021 at 08:15. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. The clinical outcome of shaking chills, light headed, and one syncopal episode was recovered in Jan2021 and of pregnant female patient received the vaccine was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event syncopal episode with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 2am of 01/29/2021 I became very over heated for about one hour. Around 3am I then became incredibly cold and shaking. Around 4am I got out of bed and stood for a few moments, then walked slowly around my room making my way to our bathroom. I noticed my vision was not right, almost like a fisheye affect and I felt dizzy. I made it to our master bathroom and sat down on a chair for a few moments before I completely passed out. I fell forward, face first on to the bathroom floor hitting the left side of my head. When I regained my conscious I was weak and shaking and was unable to call out to my husband. I slowly pulled myself up to the toilet trying to make some noise and my husband then came to my aide.  As he talked I noticed his voice sounded much farther away than it really was. I also had a difficult time cognitively answering his questions about how I felt. I was pale, clammy, still shaking. This episode from the time I left my bed from the time my husband walked me back to the bed was about 45 minutes. My husband took my temp and I did not have a fever. The next five hours I alternated between feeling very cold and very hot.  I spent the next 24 hours feeling completely depleted. I rested as much as I could and had a greater than normal appetite.

A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of immune thrombocytopenia purpura due to temporal relationship. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including platelet count at baseline and during therapy with subject drug, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

However, when they were checked again in January after the COVID vaccine series, there was evidence of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. I did not have any symptoms related to decreased blood counts.

This then transformed into moderate vaginal bleeding which lasted for about 4 days. I had no other symptoms and this was very unusual and scary. I had a vaginal ultrasound 2 days after the bleeding started and no abnornalities were found. My pap smear is also clear.

                                                Woke up feeling nauseous/diarrhea at 1 am on Wednesday (approx. 60 hours after injection). Side note- on Tuesday (day after injection), I donated blood. Not sure if this is relevant. After waking up nauseous, I experience extreme shortness of breath and full body chills for roughly 30 seconds to 1 minute. I walked about 10 steps to wake up my partner and fainted instead. I woke up to him calling my name, and almost immediately threw up. Afterwards, I felt okay, only tired and a little weak. I was able to go back to sleep and woke the next day with no lingering side effects. I would say the entire episode lasted roughly 5 minutes.

The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of  miscarriage and vaginal hemorrhage  due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.   There is limited information provided in this report.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cefazolin and levaquin and experienced allergies to both. The patient has a Mirena IUD and never get her period at all. Within 6 hours of her first Pfizer injection (02Feb2021 16:00), the patient experienced crippling lower abdominal pain followed by very very heavy bleeding and clotting. Resolved within 48 hours as quickly as it came and didn&#39;t occur with second dose 1 week out. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The events were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                On Thursday March 11, 2021 I received my first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Within about 5 second after administration I began to feel severe arm pain spreading from the injection site down to my fingers that were tingling and numb. Then within about 20 seconds of the vaccine I  fainted.   The fainting spell was brief, a few seconds, but the symptoms that continued after were long lasting.  My blood pressure after was about 80/50, I was diaphoretic, pale, had moderate arm pain (tingling, numb, painful to move) and severe nausea. I was also light headed. These symptoms lasted through the night but I felt overall improved the next day other than fatigue and lingering arm pain. Then on March 16, 2021, 5 days later, I woke up with extreme fatigue. Over the course of the day I then began to get a headache. I got back in bed and then in the afternoon started to feel moderate arm pain again at the injection site and down the entire arm. Then severe nausea set in again along with more diaphoresis, chills and light headedness. The symptoms this time again lasted through the night and I felt better again the next morning.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                I had a mild anaphylactic reaction five minutes after getting the vaccine.  The hives and tight throat went away after several doses of medication. The redness and itching last 4-5 days. I had to stay on Benadryl and Zyrtec to help with the redness and itching.  My job sent me to the ER to be monitored after getting the shot until I went home. The fatigue lasted for a whole week.

Very abnormal because I have the Nexplanon implanted in my arm and may have 2-3 periods per year. Normally the periods I do have are heavier and last 3-5days.  One week later I had about 3 days of left ovarian pain. Dose # 2- One day (which is today) after receiving my second vaccine I started with scant/ light vaginal bleeding and lower back pain. No ovarian pain yet.

Patient started to noticed mild symptoms about 8 hours afterwards, including a mild headache and backache. She reports then feeling fatigued so she went to sleep early around 8pm.   The patient reports waking up at 11pm having to go the bathroom. She notes feeling weak when walking to the bathroom, though as she was on the toilet voiding she felt nauseous. When she got up to wash her hands she felt that she was going to pass out feeling LH and dizzy. She sat down on the bathroom floor as she has a history of orthostatic hypotension, and eventually needed to lay completely flat on the ground. She reports this is when she felt as though she blacked out.  She was then able to wake up and walk back to bed feeling better, and fell back to sleep.

I went to urgent care and was prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding to no avail. I then proceeded to go to urgent care again because the bleeding had not stopped. At my second Doctors visit, I had an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound done, and both of them came back completely normal. I have now scheduled an upcoming obgyn appointment, but cannot be seen until 03/09/2021.

                                                I began feeling dizzy and nauseous about 2 hours after injection and tried to lie down but was unable to rest. I felt like I had taken adrenaline or steroids and couldn?t sleep that might. The next morning I did not want to get out of bed. My body, particular along my spine, was in so much pain that I began crying. On Monday I called in sick to work. I had almost total numbness in my left arm arm, hand, and upper body. Periodically my heart would race and feel as if was about to beat out of my chest. I started to black out in the grocery store and continue feel dizzy and weak. This is my second day off of work and I have only gotten out of bed to perform essential tasks. I am nauseated and am having trouble eating. I feel like I?ve been run over by several cars and can?t feel my left pinkie. I don?t remember ever feeling this bad for any past illness.

They placed me on a gurney, and the chills started getting so bad I was shaking and out of control and I was really cold. After about 25-30 minutes after I felt like my blood pressure dropped and I actually passed out and once I passed out I don&#39;t know how long I was out for. Maybe less than a minute, I couldn&#39;t breathe and I was hyperventilating and they put a oxygen mask on me. They took me to ER (Hospital) and I recognized I was in there when I &#34;woke up&#34; - they were trying to get an IV in me but I was shaking so much it took several attempts. They gave me several medications because I was nauseated as I wanted to vomit and they gave me anaphylactic medications. I was having chest pains. I fell asleep. They were going to admit me but I kind of refused to be admitted and they let me go with Zofran, prednisone and one other medication. One of coworker took me home. I slept the rest of the day and night. The next day, Really fatigued and chest pain was semi getting better. Breathing - was pretty okay after that. By day 3, I was fine.

Patients history includes contracting COVID back in June of 2020 for which she spent 2 days in the hospital.  In November of 2020, she reports she ended up in the hospital for another 2 days and was diagnosed with post-COVID POTS.  She then went to medical facility and underwent 6 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen in February of 2021. Patient states that after these treatments, she felt great.  She has reportedly been out of work since November, I believe, and was given the OK to return on 3/10/21.  She was also advised by her neurologist that she should take the COVID vaccine which she did on 3/15/21.  Two days later, on 3/17/21, she states that her POTS was &#34;triggered&#34; and she begain to experience dizziness, fainting, fatigue, headaches, nausea and vomiting and various GI issues. Currently, she states these symptoms are getting worse, instead of better, and she has been unable to work, missing last Thursday and Friday, and will be going home early today.  She asks if she should get her second COVID vaccine.  I advised that is something she needs to discuss with her primary care provider.

A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was shadowing another interpreter on Jan. 11, 2021  and started to feel warm, nausea. I sat down and the PA asked if I was ok and then I don&#39;t remember anything. I then fainted and my Heart rate was 30 and they called a code blue. They took me to the ER and ran test and gave me IV and everything came back normal.  After that incident, there was at least two other times I had to sit down because I was getting all the same symptoms again and thought it would happen again.  I did donate blood on January 8. I was feeling fine when prior and the following two days.

I was also extremely confused and had a very hard time speaking/explaining to my husband where the Tylenol was, where the thermometer was, etc. it was very scary.

A 34-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on Thursday, morning (11Feb2021), at the time her arm hurt. She had body aches the entire Friday (12Feb2021) and headache; she stayed in bed all day and the next day, she took Tylenol. On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I called my doctor&#39;s office who encouraged me o go to the ER since I was having symptoms of a blood clot. I went to the emergency room at Hospital where they did some blood testing.  I then went to Hospital where they did more lab work and blood testing, they did an D-dimer test ad my level was at 3.23 and explained to me it could be due to my pregnancy. They ran some more tests showing I have a  clot in the superficial femoral/ popliteal vein. They placed me on Lovanox medication for two days. I will be seeing a maternal fetal doctor tomorrow for further evaluation. They also monitored my baby and baby is doing fine.

Discomfort and feeling of swelling continued through Sunday evening. Monday (3/15/21) patient began using compression stocking and elevating leg, which eased some discomfort. Slight swelling, discomfort, and heat in the leg continued throughout entire week. DVT presumed. Contacted physician. Treatment for DVT and treatment dosage (Fondaparinux 7.5mg) commenced Wednesday (3/17/21) through to date. Discomfort has dissipated but slight swelling still remains. Appears to be getting better each day, although a very slow progression. Patient history of antiphospholipid syndrome has been managed for over fifteen years with blood thinners. Onset of a clotting event always followed a justifiable cause. No spontaneous/unexplainable clotting events to date. Patient otherwise healthy without any other current event which could explain a blood clot following vaccination. Reporting this information as it may be helpful in determining whether persons with APS or similar condition should receive Covid-19 vaccination. Note: this information being provided by patient.

I do not know if the vaccine contributed to my miscarriage but wanted to contribute to the existing data.  I had no other side effects or symptoms other than soreness at the injection site.  There were no complications with the miscarriage.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

Around 9:45 started preparing for the next day (getting coffee pot ready, etc.) up until this moment I had no side effects except pain in my arm.  Then at 9:45PM I began feeling light headed, ringing in my ears and fell unconscious. I woke up on my kitchen floor in a small pool of blood and disoriented. I do believe this reaction is related to the vaccine. I DO NOT have a history of fainting. I ate food and drank plenty of water throughout the day and after my vaccine injection. Everything about my day was typical except for the vaccination and losing consciousness.

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

I was taken to a separate area and felt warm and flush in my chest. They laid me down on the cot and said I looked pale. My hands were cold and within minutes I was shaking uncontrollably. I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

                                                Patient experienced a syncopal episode post vaccination, accompanied by feeling hot and tachycardic. Prior to the syncope, she reported hyperventilating. She remained unresponsive for about 10 minutes and was brought to the ED. There she became responsive, and reported chest pain and had sinus tachycardia episodes. She also had lower extremity weakness. This has improved per the latest neurology notes. She also had a negative EEG. Unsure if this is an allergic reaction or if the syncope was due to hyperventilation.  Patient is currently on day 3 of hospitalization.

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the booster dose, she awoke feeling extremely ill and nauseous, roused me to say so, and then immediately became unresponsive and pulseless. She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid.

The nurse on call advised me to go to the ER. I went to ER, they ran an ultra sound and all kinds of test, they said everything looked good they thought it was a Fibroid. They discharged me, and that night at 11:30pm I had a very big and fast bleed around a cup of blood and went back to the ER. That time I went to hospital because it was closer. Again they did an ultrasound and thought it was a Fibroid. I ended up seeing my OB GYN 2/8/21, she said she didn&#39;t think it was a Fibroid and sent me to get an ultrasound on 2/12/21. At that point after the bleed I had 4 days of spotting. When I went to the ultrasound they said I had a partial placenta abruption and my cervex has shortened. Since then everything has been fine.

Very weak peripheral pulses felt. Pt remained awake but very pale, diaphoretic and slightly cyanotic around the mouth. No rash, wheezing or shortness of breath. Due to low perfusion, pulse ox unable to read. Pt laid down in vehicle (at drive-through vaccine site), legs elevated.

Urticarial rash occurred on chest and abdomen.  Shortly after, she developed a wheeze.  EMS was onsite so they administered methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, Zofran, Phenergran and epinephrine IM.  Second and third dose of epinephrine was administered due to partial response from previous doses.  Patient was taken to Health care hospital for further evaluation and treatment.

                                                This is a positive one, and I can hardly believe it. My irregular pupil dilation independent of each other, occuring for 12 years corrected itself! I swear this is not a joke. I&#39;m flabbergasted.   The longer explanation:  Something I never talk about, partially because I am scared, is an issue with my eyes that started when I was 19. I am now 36.  My right pupil will dilate quite irregularly from my left. A bright light will correct it, but then it will start again after. I&#39;ve mentioned it to eye doctors, and they brushed it off. Research only has scary answers, with no help, so I have learned to live with it.  It used to make me dizzy, nauseous, and I&#39;d lay down. But over the years I&#39;ve adjusted, and it doesn&#39;t bother me.  I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 3/11. Last night, 3/14, I became dizzy and faint.   Today, I still felt that way. I was splashing cold water on my face, when I realized, looking in the mirror, my pupils were exactly the same size! And maintained that same diameter.  I keep checking, but, so far, it&#39;s consistent.   I assume the dizziness, lack of balance, and slight faintness today is my body getting used to this, as it&#39;s been compensating for the difference for 12 years.  So, is this a positive side effect? A coincidence? The vaccine is the only recent change, and nothing else has effected this issue over the years.

                                                Fainted; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable nurse. A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 36-years-old; Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient fainted on 02Mar2021 and recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot number and expiration date not provided, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 16:20 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was advised because she has been in her house so long that she is basically an agoraphobe and psychologist qualified because diagnosed with ADHD and profound anxiety at the fear of dying from COVID, anxiety and Covid-19, Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that yesterday 07Apr2021 she got her first round of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and came home and got the worst headache she ever had in her life. She states then she projectile vomited and started uncontrollably shaking. The patient stated that she was shaking uncontrollably so bad she had to take a bath. She once she took a bath, in the bath she was shaking, it was not until she raised her body temperature high enough that her body was like okay, it could let go a little bit, then she got into bed and the shaking started again. She stated she had to use her heating blanket and stayed in bed all night with it and she is still using it now. She doesn&#39;t know how she would be if she wasn&#39;t warm, she thinks the fact that she is warm, the shaking has subsided. Later, last night, around 2 or 3 the headache was piercing, her head was hurting so bad like someone was taking a nail in her left temple. If it was a stroke she would have dealt with it if she had someone there with her to help her deal with it. She has a horrible headache today. The patient stated that now it is like a regular migraine. It sounded crazy to say , but now it she stated that it was like a regular migraine, it has improved and no longer feels like she is having a stroke. The patient took two Tylenol yesterday for the headache and vomited pretty quickly after so she doesn&#39;t think she got much of it. She has not taken anything else because she does not have anything on her stomach so she does not want to take more Advil or whatever but she would like to, her head hurts really bad, she would love some pain relief. The projectile vomiting went until there was just bile. She did not eat very much yesterday. She is no longer actively vomiting, but she felt herself wanting to dry heave but feels there is nothing else to give. The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t eaten anything today so she does not know if she can keep anything down and doesn&#39;t have much water in her system. The outcome of the event headache was recovering while the outcome of other events was unknown. Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 06Apr2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3246) (at the age of 36-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included topiramate (TOPAMAX) at 250 mg, daily (2 DF 100mg and 1 DF 50mg at bedtime) taken for migraine, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received fist dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 27Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that since the second vaccination experienced tachycardia, palpitation, shortness of breath and basically blasting of air, difficulty breathing, dizziness and weakness, all on 18Jan2021. She reported pulse keeps raising, elevating to 148-157, she had palpitation complications without doing anything straight away. Elevated pulse and tachycardia, that all started and that was very concerning, pulse went to 209 and that was when she got transported to the emergency room.

On 26Mar2021 the patient experienced having discoloration on her toes, numbness and tingling and that her extremities, from the knee down and both her hands and feet were cold, ice cold. The patient was transported to the hospital by ambulance three times due to the events (hospitalizations on 22Jan2021, 30Jan2021 and 25Mar2021). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Troponin, D dimer, electrocardiogram (EKG), Chest X ray, Full blood count (CBC), exercise electrocardiogram (TMT) all resulted: normal, nuclear stress test: unknown results and pulse 148-157, 209,  all on unspecified date. The patient outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the tachycardia and other reported events  due to temporal relationship.  However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8737), administered in left arm on 01Apr2021 01:15 PM (at the age of 36-year-old) at single dose for so she could be protected from COVID (as reported). It was reported that vaccine was not administered at military facility and vaccination facility type was hospital (reported as patient drove up to vaccine clinic). The patient&#39;s medical history included acute lymphocytic leukemia from 1992 to 1996 and not ongoing (she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor). No family medical history relevant to events was reported. The patient declined being sick at the time of vaccination. No patient&#39;s concomitant medications were reported. No prior vaccinations reported within four weeks. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient previously took gentamycin, amoxicillin and flu shot, culture specific to the flu (as reported), and she experienced allergy with all three on 1996. Patient said that she was immunocompromised when she was young, she was a cancer survivor. She said that right after remission she developed a gentamycin allergy and, because of the gentamycin and amoxicillin allergy she was allergic to the flu shot, not the flu but the egg culture, because the egg culture can be that reaction. Patient also said that she had a reaction to a flu shot back in 1996 or something, it was the same rash that was with the COVID vaccine. It was reported that patient had her first Pfizer Covid vaccine dose on 01Apr2021. She reported side effects of heavy breathing, racing heart, feeling woozy, rash, and pain at the injection site. It was reported that she would like more information and she wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. Patient had both an event to report and a question. She said she had done application, the first vaccine was 2 weeks before the present report and she was not supposed to get the second until this Thursday (19Apr2021), she needed to look at a calendar. She said 01Apr2021 was her first vaccine and that she did already report her events. She said she had a bad reaction that borderline sent her to the emergency room but she instead took a BENADRYL and she laid down and then felt really really really poor the next 5 days. She said she had a terrible reaction, she didn&#39;t feel like her throat was shut, her breathing was heavy, her voice was deep, her heart was racing, like she really had to work to breathe, not like losing her airway passage, just that she had to work to breathe, she had a heavy chest, chest pain, a racing heart. She said she could best correlate it to how feels like low blood sugar, like you are going to pass out. It was also reported that patient experienced woozy, about to pass out. She said she ended up what she&#39;d call a vascular rash. She said it started in the thighs and spread down her legs. She said it was not a rash at the injection site, the rash was under the skin rather than a topical rash. She said she had a photo of it, that it seems like a vascular reaction. She would like to file a report with us because she said she felt like she did not get anything out, she had logged what happened to them and there was no correlation, no confirmation. She said she could send the photo to them. She said she was scared to get second vaccine, she wonders if she should do her due diligence to do second dose, or if she should skip it. She said there was no protocol in place, she had a telemedicine call with her doctor, there was no $200 fee due, her physician said it sounds like patient had more than a normal reaction. She said there were other things that are scary, her doctor told her she should speak to an allergist, but she said it would cost her like $600. She said she didn&#39;t feel good on immediate injection, she felt like she probably shouldn&#39;t be driving her car. She looked for her notes then she said her only normal reaction was a super painful injection site but not a rash. She said the vascular rash subsided with the use of BENADRYL. She said she could not afford an allergist to figure out what&#39;s going on. She asked why someone as small as her would get the same dose as a 200 pound man and why the doses of the vaccine were not specific to size or weight based. She also asked if based on symptoms will someone in the medical Information department advised her not to get the second dose. Events onset date were reported as 01Apr2021. The case was reported as non-serious by the consumer. No events required emergency room visit. She confirmed that she did have a telehealth meeting with her general practitioner (also reported as no events required physician office visit), she said she talked to them on the phone. No investigations assessment and relevant tests were reported. The outcome of events was resolved on 02Apr2021 for &#34;rash/ rash was under the skin/ it started in the thighs and spread down her legs&#34; and &#34;vascular rash/ rash was under the skin/ it started in the thighs and spread down her legs/ it seems like a vascular reaction&#34;, resolved on 08Apr2021 for &#34;heavy breathing/breathing was heavy, voice was deep, like she really had to work to breathe&#34; and &#34;voice was deep&#34;, and resolved on 05Apr2021 for all other events.

She started getting progressively more shortness of breath. Twice, she called the nurse line for her doctor and was advised to go to the emergency room. Added she could not catch her breath, and it was worse at night, could not sleep, so she went to the emergency room, she was in emergency room for 2 and a half hours and then went home. She wanted to know if the second dose could cause issues or if she should get it, added that the paperwork said that people should not get the vaccine if they received an adverse reaction to the first dose or any vaccination. She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. She was not sure whether progressively worsening shortness of breath had gotten any better or was still going on, added that yesterday was the day she did not need either treatment medication. The day before, she took just the anxiety medicine and not the albuterol. Yesterday, she took none. During the day on 11Apr2021 (Sunday), she had called because she was feeling uncomfortable constantly. She has two children and all day she did not feel well. She told her husband she did not feel well at all. Sunday when she went to lay down, she could not sleep. Patient reported that as her shortness of breath subsided, her arm started hurting again, thought this began on 19Apr2021 and was not sure, it went away completely and was just at the injection site, probably lasting half a day or so and then it went away, clarified as left arm, same as injection. Caller added that 15Apr2021 was after the ER visit, was that she was standing up doing things and from her knee down felt tingly. Stated that knee down felt tingly on 15Apr2021, which was after her ER visit occurred, she was standing up and doing things. She had not been doing things for long periods but her knee down felt tingly. Added not like numb, but like her legs were falling asleep. She was preparing dinner and moving around and felt tingling in both legs. This probably lasted about three hours. She just kind of took it easy and it started to subside and then it was gone. While mentioned investigations, patient stated the ER did an EKG, where they put stickers and monitor her heart. They did a chest x-ray, and they took blood. She believed they checked for blood clot tests and anemia. Patient did not know any results but stated the doctor came into the room and told her everything was clear and nothing came back with anything on it. She stated the date was either the night of 11Apr2021 or the morning of 12Apr2021 for the tests. Outcome of the events shortness of breath and arm hurting was recovered/resolved in Apr2021; of the event knee down felt tingly/like her legs were falling asleep was recovered/resolved on 15Apr2021; while of remain was unknown.

A 37-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ek5730), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 28Dec2020 12:00PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at hospital facility. Medical history included Hashimotos disease. The patient had no known allergies and has not had COVID prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she felt tired and confused and unwell on day of injection, 28Dec2020. After three days (31Dec2020), she developed hives on her stomach and arm and seven days later (04Jan2021), she was diagnosed with pneumonia and continued to have hives all over her legs and arms to this day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. She underwent Covid test/ Nasal swab post vaccination on 09Jan2021, pending result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported pneumonia was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient was observed for 15 minutes in the observation area without incident.  She arose and walked to the exit and then apparently fainted on the sidewalk outside the vaccination clinic.  She was attended to by medical staff on site and because she was responding slower than expected and complained of pain on the right side of her head and weakness of her left arm and leg an ambulance was called via 911.  Care was assumed by paramedics who placed her in the ambulance where she was warmed and examined further.  She eventually denied any continuing pain or weakness (per ambulance crewman) and she was released to the care of her boyfriend / fiance.

A 37-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 37-year-old, on 04Feb2021 16:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior. Concomitant medication included ongoing drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (DROSPIRENONE/ETHINYLESTRADIOL) taken for contraception.  The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL3302) single dose, at the age of 37-year-old, on 14Jan2021 1500PM in the left arm, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced fatigue and a sore arm. On 05Feb2021, the patient experienced fatigue, sore arm, mild chills, and body aches. On 08Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized because of vertebral artery dissection after an intense workout that morning/ she tore a vertebral artery in her neck which she immediately clotted and led to her having a stroke. The patient had vertigo, nausea and weakness on 08Mar2021 and went to the ER and they found she had a thrombolytic stroke in the cerebellum as a result of the vertebral artery dissection. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 08Mar2021 then she was discharged 11Mar2021. While she was in the hospital, they did an MRI and found two sub-acute thrombolytic strokes or blood clots in her brain. The patient tore the artery in her neck which led to the right cerebellar stroke; her blood was really clotty but they could tell by the imaging that the two subacute blood clots that led to having the other two strokes were there approximately three weeks before but not much older than that (without exhibiting symptoms, so she had three thrombotic strokes in total). Since she was discharged she has been out of work and will be on FML for two to three months and going to physical therapy from the effects of the strokes. Adds while she was in the hospital they were trying to determine the cause of the two sub-acute strokes that were unrelated to the dissection. They did several tests including: EKG which was normal; TEE scope down her throat to look at her heart which was normal; and blood work to check for a clotting disorder which was also all normal.  So far nothing has been found. Outcome of mild chills, body aches, and sore arm was recovered on 06Mar2021; outcome of vertebral artery dissection and right cerebellar stroke was recovering; while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

                                                Within 5 minutes of vaccination patient began to experience tachycardia and throat tightening. She was given 25 mg cap Benadryl PO and assistance was called when her heart rate reached 150 BPM about a minute later and further climbed to 188 BPM. She was transported to the Emergency Department where she was administered epinephrine, lorazepam, methylprednisolone, racepinephrine, and lactated ringers. She spent several hours in the Emergency Department and was discharged home but returned later that night at 06:00 PM for return of symptoms (tachycardia: 185 BPM, anxiety) and was administered Benadryl, solumedrol, Pepcid, Ativan, and Lactated Ringers. She was diagnosed with acute allergic reaction, nascent anaphylaxis, and panic attack. She went home again after this second ED visit.  On Monday, 1/4/21, the patient reported to Employee Health with resumption of symptoms. Calming techniques were discussed and she went to a quiet area for 15 minutes to compose herself. Employee Health Nurse referred patient to Employee Assistance Program for anxiety care.

My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

                                                The day following the 2nd vaccination dose, I had zero symptoms other than a slightly sore injection site.  Around hour 30 following the vaccination I began to feel warm, and I got up to brush my teeth and cool off in the bathroom.  As I was brushing my teeth, I started experiencing an increasing ringing noise in both my ears that I thought was strange and somewhat alarming, but I didn&#39;t feel any signs of dizziness or dysphoria.  The next thing I remember is waking up the bathroom floor with my husband standing over me.  Apparently I experienced a complete lose of consciousness and feel to the floor, hitting my chin on the bathroom vanity as I feel and splitting my chin open, which I have zero recollection of.  My husband states that when he found me, that my eyes were open, but I was staring blankly at him with a glazed over look and my whole body was limp and diaphoretic.  I came too in about 30 seconds after he found me, but I was very confused, not making a lot of sense, and felt very disoriented and weak.  It took about 20 mins for my fever to break, and to have the strength and power to get up and walk to bed.  We changed all my clothes because I had soaked through them, and he got me into bed after cleaning/bandaging up my chin.  I then slept solidly until noon the next day, which is very unlike me, but since then I have felt relatively fine with no other experiences of fever/chills/disorientation, just some continued mild fatigue off and on.  After discussing with my nursing colleagues, they all had similar experiences around hour 24-30 post 2nd vaccine with fevers, chills, restless sleep, or just general malaise, but no one experienced a complete loose of consciousness, so I reached out to my PCP yesterday, and she confirmed today that I should report this to VAERS.  I have never experienced any form of loss of consciousness/fainting/black-out/syncope prior to this, which is another reason I thought it was important for me to report this.

Wasn&#39;t any better and lost my taste and smell for 3 days. Went to the Clinic, was tested for Covid-19 and the flu both negative. Went back to the Clinic and had chest x-ray, diagnosed with right middle lobe pneumonia.  Sent home with doxycycline and zofran. Took the Medication as directed. Still feeling dizzy and lightheaded, and still winded and extremely tired after doing the slightest bit of house work, whether it would be sweeping the floor, doing dishes, or laundry. I get extremely after doing one activity. I still have not driven.

Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000).  The patient experienced rught MCA stroke on 25Dec2020 06:15. Seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization, life threatening. The patient was hospitalized for rught MCA stroke for 3 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 25Dec2020.  The patient received unspecified treatment  for rught MCA stroke. The outcome of event was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The subject had medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  The reported stroke was more likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

She went to the hospital the second time for chest pain that woke her up on 11Jan2021. It started at like 3AM. She thought it was heart burn. She tried to go back to sleep. It continued while she was at work. She told her supervisor who sent her to the hospital. They did not admit her. They did do an EKG on 11Jan2021 and it was abnormal, but not indicative of heart attack. Thought it was gastritis. Her doctor thought the heart attack was on the 02Jan2021.

Pharmacist was called over and patient had her head between her knees while sitting in the waiting area.  She said she felt very dizzy but sitting forward wasn&#39;t helping.  Then about 30 seconds later patient stated she was going to pass out and wanted to lay on the floor.  While getting up she fell down and passed out, hitting her head on the cement floor.  911 called.  Patient came to about a minute later and stated she was going to throw up.  She spit a bit but didn&#39;t vomit.  She turned very pale and then turned bright yellow.  She was in and out a consciousness for a few minutes until paramedics arrived.  They examined her and took her to the er to verify if she had a concussion and make sure she was okay.

                                                No known heart issues. On Friday 2/26, very suddenly I went into atrial fabulation rapid ventricular response. I went to the ER. This was confirmed many times by EKGs and lasted 4.5 hours with HR ranging from 8-173 at rest. I was given a medication, Diltiazem 30 mg tab, and my heart rate regulated. Many tests were completed at ER and so far, no known cause for this event has been determined based on test findings. So symptoms lasted from 5pm to 9:45pm. Given medication which resolved the Afib. Stayed at ER running tests until 3:30am.

I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.

The patient medical history included five weeks postpartum; concomitant medications were not reported. On 19Mar2021 the patient experienced bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery that was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. These events required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and were described as follows: patient was five weeks postpartum and was exclusively breastfeeding the newborn. Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

Slight headache, low fever and slight chest pain began. Felt better by the afternoon of 3/30 once I took ibuprofen. That evening at approximately 7 pm, I noticed my heart rate was high. My resting HR is about 70, but my HR was at 125 - 130 and I was not exerting myself and was sitting. My HR remained high after I went to bed, and chest pain became worse. By 12:30 am on 3/31, chest pain was getting severe and had pain in both arms. Went to ER at around 3 am on 3/31. Later learning I had a mild heart attack. Had EKG, Blood work, ECG, and Heart Catheritazion. No blockage and normal results except blood work. Blood work showed elevated enzymes.  While in the ER, I was given blood thinner and glycerin tablets, aspirin. Since 4/2, my heart rate and blood pressure have returned to their norm without medication.  I once again have perfect blood pressure readings and perfect HR.  I have returned to normal daily activities as of 4/4.

It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

                                                Internal brain bleeding 10 days after 1st dose covid vaccine; Brain damage; confused; suffering memory loss; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician (patient). This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient). This is the second of two cases and refers to events occurred with the second dose of the vaccine.  A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot EL1283), on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, shellfish allergy, allergy lobster (used steroids). Patient was not pregnant.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Previously on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM patient took the first dose of the vaccine (Lot EJ1685) at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization and couple of days after she had nausea and something stuck in her throat. On 11Jan2021, 5 minutes after the 2nd dose (at 11:05), the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, that required Emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLUMEDROL) and &#34;Pepcid&#34;: she was prescribed 3-day course of oral prednisone and H2 antihistamine oral &#34;Pepcid&#34;. After finished it, she felt it was coming back therefore she took diphenhydramine hydrochloride for 2 nights in a row. She did not experience any respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestation. She completely recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of anaphylactic reaction  due to temporal relationship.   There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

A 39-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, it was reported that the patient experienced &#34;a sense of her throat swelling&#34; and hives 1 hour after the vaccination occurred. The patient received 1 dose of Benadryl and Tylenol and &#34;felt ok.&#34; The physician commented that the patient did not have full anaphylaxis and was asking if it would be safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine at the time of report. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccination dose at 12:37PM. Patient was seated in the vaccination waiting area for her 15 minutes observation window. About 5 minutes after vaccination the patient fainted and fell out of her chair on to the ground. She hit her head on the wall behind her, and ground when falling. Pharmacy staff immediately went to check on patient. She was found to be breathing, but unresponsive for about 20 seconds. 911 was called immediately by another employee. She was positioned lying on the ground with her feet up and came to consciousness quickly. Once awake patient was alert, verbal, and seemed to have a normal mental status. She reported no respiratory issues, no throat or lip symptoms, and no itching or hives. She states that she felt fine other than her head hurting from the fall. She reported no symptoms prior to waking up on the ground. She was speaking in full sentences, responsive, and had a strong, steady pulse at 98 bpm and a normal respiratory rate. No hives, swelling were observed. Patient reported she was a type 1 diabetic and her blood sugar was found to be normal (approx. 145) after she was able to sit. No medications were administered on site as she did not report any additional symptoms indicative of anaphylaxis. The ambulance and local PD arrived quickly. She was walked outside for observation and appeared to be taken away in the ambulance.  The patient was not reached for a follow-up call to check in on her later the same afternoon.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities.

On the morning of April 10th I awoke to feeling severely winded as if I had run 18 marathons just to walk up 3 steps or to walk across a room.  I was taken to the ER where they performed a catscan on me and could see that my lungs were ?full? of blood clots and I was experiencing a pulmonary embolism.  I do not smoke, take birth control pills, I do not drink.  There is no family history of clotting, nor did any traumatic incident happen within the last two weeks to cause this.

                                                Mild anaphylaxis--tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway; This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot was unknown due to not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at age of 39-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eczema, known allergies: Food sensitives including gluten and dairy. Rashes with prolonged skin contact with metals or adhesives. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID was not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylaxis-tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway on 19Mar2021. Started about 2min after shot. Occlusion lasted for 7minutes. EMS said vitals were normal. Swollen tongue lasted 24 hours. Have never had an allergic response to any vaccine before. The events were non-serious. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of anaphylaxis was recovered in 2021, of tongue swelling was recovered on 20Mar2021, of occlusion of airway was recovered on 19Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event anaphylaxis cannot be totally excluded.
