I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

                                                Heavy vaginal bleeding noticed a few hours after injection. I have been spotting (1 pad daily) because of my birth control, but now I?m using 6-7 pads a day and soaking through them. I?m not sure if it?s related but I?m also extremely fatigued and having chills.  Should I ask for a blood test for my platelet count?  I?ve read it is a very rare reaction for some to have lower counts.

The patient received first dose of COVID vaccine BNT162B2 (lot number= Ej1685) at the age of 28 years on 22Dec2020 on the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient reported that 2 weeks after the second vaccine, she underwent hip labral surgery and suffered a PE on 22Feb2021. She was not sure if the vaccine could have contributed to the PE or just the surgery but wanted to report just incase. She was taking aspirin to prevent DVT&#39;s. The patient was hospitalized for pe (pulmonary embolism) for 3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures (DOAC) were taken as a result of pe (pulmonary embolism). The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event pulmonary embolism is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Patient&#39;s hip surgery two weeks after the vaccine might have contributed to the event onset.

                                                Within 7 hours of receiving the vaccine, I started what I thought was my second period of the month. I had just finished a period 12 days earlier. I am usually 35 - 42 days between periods so this was VERY unusual for me. I had my normal period pre-vaccine Jan 4 - 9 then 7 hours after the vaccine started bleeding again from the 21-25 of January. Then again on Feb 4 - 9. I got my second vaccine while bleeding. Then again started to bleed on Feb 21 - 25. I had a doctors appointment at the end of February. I got an annual gyno exam as well as a ton of bloodwork was taken to check everything out. I was told to continue to monitor the bleeding and if it didn&#39;t stop we would do a pelvic ultrasound. Well, it didn&#39;t stop so we did and it came back normal. I had a mostly normal March with light bleeding. I thought perhaps it was getting better but no. I have had two periods in April. In fact still bleeding on round two and this is my 6th day bleeding. Periods or irregular bleeding was April 12-17 and then again on April 24 - 29 (still happening and it&#39;s the 29th). This is very scary to me as no doctors can help.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information Requested on Lot/ Batch number.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported faint was most likely due to an accident, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).

                                                Upon receiving my first shot, I felt weak, and after a few days a tingly feeling in my head. Symptoms lasted for 2 weeks. After receiving the second dose, I had a fever that evening and weakness, it lasted through the next day. My right arm was sore for 2 days.  I took Advil, Tylenol, and ibuprofen (at different times). Symptoms of fever lasted two days and were gone, I was left feeling weak, it lasted for a day.  Now day 5 after I got my shot (got the last dose 1/22/2021), I have noticed some vaginal bleeding that has been going on for 2 days now (It&#39;s not the menstrual period since I had that going on a week before I got my last shot). I am wondering if there are any other women who have experienced the same reaction to their body. Kindly feel free to call me or email me with any answers. I am trying to reach my primary physician who is currently booked till February.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

Did not work. EMT loaded me on the stretcher out of my car in the ambulance. Gave albuterol mix in nebulizer. Went into full anaphylaxis on the way to ER. 4 epi in the arm did not help 2 benedrylmshits to the arm did not help. I was on 5L oxygen until the epi was mixed with albuterol to pen airways. Anaphylactic episodes continued every 5 hours for 2 days, then became every 12 hours, then 24 hours, then 12 hours. Steroids, Claritin, antacid, albuterol epi mix have helped managed episodes. Still currently in the hospital.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included allergy test: unknown results   on Jan2021   , body temperature: 100.8   on 13Jan2021. The reaction began 28 minutes later. She says she started to get jumpy, her hands swelled and got itchy. She couldn&#39;t bend her hands, they were so swollen that she couldn&#39;t bend them. Her legs were shaking. Then saline and eventually her mouth started to get numb and they used an Epi pen twice. Her throat never closed, she thinks it did not close because the Epi pen was done twice, She had 2 masks on she cannot say for sure if she had trouble breathing but her mouth began to get dry and tingly and she started to no be able to feel her mouth. She says she would says it was resolved completely the next day.  The patient also received Decadron and  Benadryl. The reporter would say the event were life threatening because they treat it that way due to anaphylaxis precautions.   Follow up information has been requested.

                                                Approximately 12 days after vaccination co began to have fatigue, weakness, Pancytopenia      Recent hospitalization which involved initial presentation at hospital on AK 12/29, and then again on 12/30, after eval on 12/30 was then transferred to another hospital, and later transferred where she later recovered and was discharged.      She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

My face felt &#34;buzzy&#34; but didn&#39;t swell and I did not have significant itching. I have had similar reactions in the past to cleaning products and pesticides and usually take a benadryl, though I do carry an epipen and had one with me at the time. Instead of going back in the convention center for medical attention I took a benadryl and waited in the parking garage for about an hour and felt the throat restriction ease a bit. About 10 hours later around 8pm the tightness came back suddenly over about 10 minutes and I took another benadryl. The next morning around 7am I had one more round of tightening and took one more benadryl, and it stopped after that. I told my doctor about it a few days later.

                                                4 days after my last vaccine I started getting really intense calf pain like a bad cramp. After the pain just kept getting worse I ended up going to the ER on January 15th 2021. They did an ultrasound and found out I had a dvt. I was also experiencing horrible migraines since the 1st shot I also started seeing black spots in my vision. I also was having fevers and chills

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

This 30-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 at 14:15 (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. The patient did not have allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication received within 2 weeks of vaccination included birth control. On 30Mar2021, several hours later at 21:00, when she was laying down for bed, the patient started having pain in the right side of her chest when she inhaled. It got worse while laying down. It still hurt to inhale in the morning so she went to urgent care. They did an X-ray of her lungs and determined she had pneumonia developing in her right lung. The patient stated that she had not been sick prior and no fever or anything so was not sure why it came on so suddenly. The patient was treated for pneumonia with an antibiotic. The clinical outcome of pneumonia was unknown. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.

                                                DVT (Phlegm Asia Cerulean Dolmens); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable health care professional (patient). This 30-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL9262) at single dose via an unknown route in left arm on 27Jan2021 12:00 PM for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included urinary tract infection. Family history included chronic kidney disease (CKD). No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. Other medications in two weeks included spironolactone 50 mg, daily. Historical vaccine included 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3248) at single dose via an unknown route in left arm on 06Jan2021 17:30 for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient experienced DVT (Phlegm Asia Cerulean Dolans) on 29Jan2021 05:00 AM. AE resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, and was serious due to hospitalization and life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The event resulted in 2-day hospitalization. Known allergies included and had reaction (hives) to apixaban (ELIQUIS) upon discharge from hospital after thrombectomy. Covid tested (saliva) post vaccination on 13Feb2021was negative. The event treatment included thrombolysis, thrombectomy. Outcome of the event was resolved with sequel (reported as recovered with lasting effects).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported event deep vein thrombosis occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.

                                                I had my first dose of Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine on the 5th of April, 2021 at 1pm. I had sore arm and was fatigued which was expected. However, the day I had my vaccine was also the day my menstrual cycle started and just to assure myself I informed the pharmacist and asked if that was okay and they said it shouldn?t be a concern.   I was doing fine until toward the end of day 3. I was expecting my period to stop as it always does on 3rd day  but I started bleeding heavier that day there after. It didn?t worry me much until I started discharging huge blood clots  as big as an apple 2 times every after 30 mins from that moment.   I rushed to the ER later that night(still bleeding heavily with blood clots every now and then) but I was not admitted since my vitals and the blood counts were normal at that moment.   I went back home  and hoped the bleeding would stop but again with on pain or fever what so ever I kept bleeding all day. This is my 5th day of bleeding. Then on Sunday morning, I still kept bleeding heavy and I was too weak that I went back to the ER again.   This time , (day 6) I got admitted because I have had lost a lot of blood and I needed blood transfusion. My HB dropped from 11.3 to 6.7 and it went further down to 5 something. I got 3 units of blood transfusion in the ER. They did ultrasound, CT scans(with and without contrast) and still couldn?t figure out the cause of the bleeding. My uterus showed no problems but my body was not even responding to Tranexamic acid to stop the bleeding. So the doctor proceeded with an angiogram and did an emergency uterine artery Embolization to stop the blood supply to the uterus. The bleeding stopped there after and I started regaining my vitals.  However, the cause of the bleeding still remains unknown.

This other HCP (patient) reported for herself that a 30-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8727) at the age of 30-years, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Mar2021 13:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization, in hospital. Medical history included PTSD, anorexia, chronic migraines, bradycardia. Patient was not pregnancy at time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included propranolol, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), prazosin, alprazolam (XANAX). On 19Mar2021 13:15, the patient experienced allergic reaction-characterized by hives and flushing and anaphylactic reaction (throat and mouth swelling). After medical treatment, hives continued for 3-4 days. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received high dose diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and epinephrine (EPIPEN). Outcome of the events was recovered in 2021. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events of Allergic reaction, Anaphylactic reaction.

A 31-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via Intramuscular on 23Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was seen in the ED for petechiae and ecchymoses on 15Jan2021. She had not taken any recent medication or had any illness previous to this event. The only feature that was new to her was the vaccination provided 23Dec2020 and 09Jan2021 to complete her COVID series. Lab assessment showed platelet count decreased to 22,000 cells per cubic microliter (normal over 140,000). She had no other findings to describe cause of her decreased platelet count by lab or clinical exam. Provided a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia purpura, in the ED setting, she started pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four consecutive days with a follow blood count showing resolution on day 4 of her treatment with a platelet count of 230,000 cells per cubic microliter. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received Steroids as treatment. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event immune thrombocytopenia purpura was recovered in Jan2021.

Then, 2 days later (1/14/21) I had a CBC with diff drawn, as I am currently being worked up for possible ITP and have been getting a CBC with diff every 2 months to monitor my blood counts. My platelets and other blood counts had been trending up and were back in normal ranges when they were last checked back in November. However, when they were checked again in January after the COVID vaccine series, there was evidence of thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. I did not have any symptoms related to decreased blood counts.

This then transformed into moderate vaginal bleeding which lasted for about 4 days. I had no other symptoms and this was very unusual and scary. I had a vaginal ultrasound 2 days after the bleeding started and no abnornalities were found. My pap smear is also clear.

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

This also started within 24 hours of receiving the first shot and lasted for 5 days.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cefazolin and levaquin and experienced allergies to both. The patient has a Mirena IUD and never get her period at all. Within 6 hours of her first Pfizer injection (02Feb2021 16:00), the patient experienced crippling lower abdominal pain followed by very very heavy bleeding and clotting. Resolved within 48 hours as quickly as it came and didn&#39;t occur with second dose 1 week out. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The events were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had a mild anaphylactic reaction five minutes after getting the vaccine.  The hives and tight throat went away after several doses of medication. The redness and itching last 4-5 days. I had to stay on Benadryl and Zyrtec to help with the redness and itching.  My job sent me to the ER to be monitored after getting the shot until I went home. The fatigue lasted for a whole week.

Very abnormal because I have the Nexplanon implanted in my arm and may have 2-3 periods per year. Normally the periods I do have are heavier and last 3-5days.  One week later I had about 3 days of left ovarian pain. Dose # 2- One day (which is today) after receiving my second vaccine I started with scant/ light vaginal bleeding and lower back pain. No ovarian pain yet.

I went to urgent care and was prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding to no avail. I then proceeded to go to urgent care again because the bleeding had not stopped. At my second Doctors visit, I had an abdominal and a transvaginal ultrasound done, and both of them came back completely normal. I have now scheduled an upcoming obgyn appointment, but cannot be seen until 03/09/2021.

                                                pneumonia; Fever; chills; nausea; difficulty breathing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 33-year-old non-pregnant female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 21Jan2021 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient experienced fever, chills, nausea, pneumonia, and difficulty breathing on 11Feb2021 23:00 with outcome of recovering. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed of covid prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab test post vaccination: negative on 13Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events (antibiotics, IV fluids, Tylenol). The patient received second dose (Lot Number: EN6201) on 12Feb2021 12:00 PM in the left arm.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the events fever, chills, and nausea were related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events pneumonia and difficulty breathing with Bnt162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine.

Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

I called my doctor&#39;s office who encouraged me o go to the ER since I was having symptoms of a blood clot. I went to the emergency room at Hospital where they did some blood testing.  I then went to Hospital where they did more lab work and blood testing, they did an D-dimer test ad my level was at 3.23 and explained to me it could be due to my pregnancy. They ran some more tests showing I have a  clot in the superficial femoral/ popliteal vein. They placed me on Lovanox medication for two days. I will be seeing a maternal fetal doctor tomorrow for further evaluation. They also monitored my baby and baby is doing fine.

Discomfort and feeling of swelling continued through Sunday evening. Monday (3/15/21) patient began using compression stocking and elevating leg, which eased some discomfort. Slight swelling, discomfort, and heat in the leg continued throughout entire week. DVT presumed. Contacted physician.

Appears to be getting better each day, although a very slow progression. Patient history of antiphospholipid syndrome has been managed for over fifteen years with blood thinners. Onset of a clotting event always followed a justifiable cause. No spontaneous/unexplainable clotting events to date. Patient otherwise healthy without any other current event which could explain a blood clot following vaccination.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Is pregnant: yes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 27Jan2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3249) and dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17Feb2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200); both as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included pregnancy, allergies to penicillin and Covid prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient experienced pulmonary embolism on 18Apr2021 16:00 which resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. CT scan and ultrasound were done, and patient was given lovenox injections. The patient is pregnant with last menstrual cycle on 20Jan2021; delivery date will be on 05Nov2021. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The outcome of the event pulmonary embolism was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported event Pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The contribution of pregnancy to thromboembolic events should also be considered. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 35-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8736), via unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included react like that normally is it eat bananas or sweet potato, asthmatic. Concomitant medications included vitamins nos. The patient previously took Wellbutrin, Methocarbamol and both experienced drug allergy. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER8735) on 02Apr2021 at the age of 35 years old for COVID-19 immunisation and had menstruation irregular. The patient got her 2nd Vaccine that past Saturday and she got it on her left side of her body and her lip swelled up on left side and then she got a rash but the rash was going away and swelling going down but she thought she needed to report that. The patient still had not had periods which was very unusual for her and she tested the pregnancy test and she was not pregnant. Anatomical site of swelling was stated as left side of her lip on her face it looked like she got stung by a bee and then the swelling had been going down on that, the rash was going away as well. When confirmed the event start date, 25Apr2021 was stated for the swelling and rash. For causality the patient stated that she thought so because she was allergic and she avoided she had not got a rash like that from eating them. She also got like swelled lips or hives and she did not get hives and in this period that was the only thing and she had couple of other friends that had biological symptoms too, so that was the reason she was pretty sure it was connected. The patient stated that the swelling and the rash was still there, the swollen lip was going down and she had not yet started her cycle. She also stated that swelling was improved, rash was better but she could still see it. After her vaccine she was really tired and she was sure a lot of people were so she just fall asleep for 12 hours. When she woke up it was a little better. So she did not take anything specifically for that. When described the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated that it looked kind of well she mean let her look at the rash so its on her left armpit kind of going towards her chest and its kind of scratchy and red in rays its kind of itches over then but its not writhing or sheathing. She was asleep for 12hrs she thought it came up some time either late Saturday night or early Sunday morning. She didn&#39;t had any problem in breathing, she didn&#39;t have tightness in her chest no racing heartrate nothing like that. No medical intervention required. No Emergency Department and no hospitalization. The patient got dry mouth but again she didn&#39;t like super weird, she didn&#39;t had any racing heart rate, she did not had any respiratory symptoms, obviously dermatologically did. She would say as reaction go well significantly minor she had soreness at injection site but she didn&#39;t had any raised she wasn&#39;t raised can&#39;t even tell now for that well that fine. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure required. Her husband was positive back in the fall. She was tested but she quarantined from him and she never got it. She tested 4 times negative. The outcome of the event rash, lip swelling and swelling was recovering, while other events were unknown.

She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name). Events visit to Emergency Room. They did a CBC and she was in normal range for everything. Lab data included on 20Jan2021: CBC normal. Outcome of the event Swollen tongue was recovering.  Outcome of the event Anaphylactic reaction/anaphylaxis was recovered.  Outcome of the event injection site soreness was not recovered. Outcome of the events was unknown.

The nurse on call advised me to go to the ER. I went to ER, they ran an ultra sound and all kinds of test, they said everything looked good they thought it was a Fibroid. They discharged me, and that night at 11:30pm I had a very big and fast bleed around a cup of blood and went back to the ER. That time I went to hospital because it was closer. Again they did an ultrasound and thought it was a Fibroid. I ended up seeing my OB GYN 2/8/21, she said she didn&#39;t think it was a Fibroid and sent me to get an ultrasound on 2/12/21. At that point after the bleed I had 4 days of spotting. When I went to the ultrasound they said I had a partial placenta abruption and my cervex has shortened. Since then everything has been fine.

                                                Received the vaccine at 10:40am on 3/24/2021 and felt normal. At 1:20pm anaphylaxis set in - experienced tingling then tightness in throat, tongue swelled, swallowing would cause me to choke and tongue would get stuck blocking air passage. Hyperventilating began as I could not get enough air into my lungs. For 15 minutes tried drinking water and laying down to help open airways. Breathing slightly eased for 2-4 minutes and then the anaphylaxis would spike again. This happened 3x getting worse,  I called my Primary Care Physician&#39;s office and was advised to go to the ER immediately. At 2:15pm I arrived at the ER and at 2:30pm I was given a 1mg shot of EPINEPHrine, and intravenous shots of diphenhydrAMINE, methylPREDNISolone, and famotidine along with oxygen. Anaphylaxis finally dissipated around 3:30pm and by 5pm I was breathing more normally. I was discharged at 7:00pm, and was feeling very energized. I was also given a prescription for an epipen incase I should have any further issues.  The next morning, 3/25/2021 I woke up after 5 hours of sleep feeling extremely energized. I had a virtual doctor&#39;s appointment with my allergist, Dr. at 12:00pm. My doctor was surprised at how well I seemed to be doing and we made arrangements to do further allergy tests in 2 weeks. We came to the conclusion that I am most likely allergic to POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL. This ingredient is also in a cold medicine that I was taking in January and I was experiencing minor anaphylaxis (which I thought was due to the extreme congestion I was experiencing with the cold). It is also an ingredient (aka PEG) in an eye cream that caused a severe eczema patch under my eye in January.   After my appt, at 1:30pm I went into anaphylaxis again. My throat got tingley and began to close, my tongue swelled and again was getting stuck in my throat when I attempted to swallow. I laid down and tried to get in deep breaths. My husband bought children&#39;s BENADRYL, which does not have polyethylene glycol in it, and gave me 15ml at 2:15pm. I reached out to my allergist, Dr. and updated him. He advised that I immediately take an additional 5ml of the BENADRYL. Dr. prescribed me 60mg/day Prednisone for 2 days followed by 40mg/day of Prednisone for 4 days, 40mg/day Famotidine for 2 weeks, 10mg/day antihistamine (I chose loratadine) for 2 weeks. Dr. also shared that I should have been prescribed steroids when I was discharged from the hospital, but my energetic state gave the impression I was OK. My manic energy was a result of the epinephrine, which had finally worn off 23 hours later, causing my body to begin the allergic reaction all over again.  The evening of 3/25/2021 (after the first dose of 60mg prednisone, 40mg famotidine, and 10mg loratadine) and all three meals on 3/26/2021 I experienced minor anaphylaxis when I began to eat. Tightness in throat throughout the meal and lasting an additional 20 minutes following the meal. My throat has reopened after each incident on 3/26/2021 and I was able to breathe normally again.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) lot number and expiration date not provided, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 16:20 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was advised because she has been in her house so long that she is basically an agoraphobe and psychologist qualified because diagnosed with ADHD and profound anxiety at the fear of dying from COVID, anxiety and Covid-19, Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient stated that yesterday 07Apr2021 she got her first round of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and came home and got the worst headache she ever had in her life. She states then she projectile vomited and started uncontrollably shaking. The patient stated that she was shaking uncontrollably so bad she had to take a bath. She once she took a bath, in the bath she was shaking, it was not until she raised her body temperature high enough that her body was like okay, it could let go a little bit, then she got into bed and the shaking started again. She stated she had to use her heating blanket and stayed in bed all night with it and she is still using it now. She doesn&#39;t know how she would be if she wasn&#39;t warm, she thinks the fact that she is warm, the shaking has subsided. Later, last night, around 2 or 3 the headache was piercing, her head was hurting so bad like someone was taking a nail in her left temple. If it was a stroke she would have dealt with it if she had someone there with her to help her deal with it. She has a horrible headache today. The patient stated that now it is like a regular migraine. It sounded crazy to say , but now it she stated that it was like a regular migraine, it has improved and no longer feels like she is having a stroke. The patient took two Tylenol yesterday for the headache and vomited pretty quickly after so she doesn&#39;t think she got much of it. She has not taken anything else because she does not have anything on her stomach so she does not want to take more Advil or whatever but she would like to, her head hurts really bad, she would love some pain relief. The projectile vomiting went until there was just bile. She did not eat very much yesterday. She is no longer actively vomiting, but she felt herself wanting to dry heave but feels there is nothing else to give. The patient stated that she hasn&#39;t eaten anything today so she does not know if she can keep anything down and doesn&#39;t have much water in her system. The outcome of the event headache was recovering while the outcome of other events was unknown. Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

She wanted to know if the second dose could cause issues or if she should get it, added that the paperwork said that people should not get the vaccine if they received an adverse reaction to the first dose or any vaccination. She did not know if this was normal for it to get progressively worse and 2 to 14 days later. Patient wanted to know if the shortness of breath was something that can get worse, if this was a reaction to the vaccine even though it happened so many days later. Patient added it was the only thing she could think of and that her heart rate, oxygen levels, and everything was good minus she felt like she could not catch her breath. The doctor in the ER gave her anti-anxiety medicine, something with an L, but the doctor gave her that and it really seemed to help. It was kind of like, she did not know, it made her feel calm enough to fall asleep. Caller added that she has that and an salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. She was not sure whether progressively worsening shortness of breath had gotten any better or was still going on, added that yesterday was the day she did not need either treatment medication. The day before, she took just the anxiety medicine and not the albuterol. Yesterday, she took none. During the day on 11Apr2021 (Sunday), she had called because she was feeling uncomfortable constantly. She has two children and all day she did not feel well. She told her husband she did not feel well at all. Sunday when she went to lay down, she could not sleep. Patient reported that as her shortness of breath subsided, her arm started hurting again, thought this began on 19Apr2021 and was not sure, it went away completely and was just at the injection site, probably lasting half a day or so and then it went away, clarified as left arm, same as injection.

She had not been doing things for long periods but her knee down felt tingly. Added not like numb, but like her legs were falling asleep. She was preparing dinner and moving around and felt tingling in both legs. This probably lasted about three hours. She just kind of took it easy and it started to subside and then it was gone. While mentioned investigations, patient stated the ER did an EKG, where they put stickers and monitor her heart. They did a chest x-ray, and they took blood. She believed they checked for blood clot tests and anemia. Patient did not know any results but stated the doctor came into the room and told her everything was clear and nothing came back with anything on it. She stated the date was either the night of 11Apr2021 or the morning of 12Apr2021 for the tests.

A 37-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 37-year-old, on 04Feb2021 16:30, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history was not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines 4 weeks prior. Concomitant medication included ongoing drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (DROSPIRENONE/ETHINYLESTRADIOL) taken for contraception.  The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EL3302) single dose, at the age of 37-year-old, on 14Jan2021 1500PM in the left arm, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced fatigue and a sore arm. On 05Feb2021, the patient experienced fatigue, sore arm, mild chills, and body aches. On 08Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized because of vertebral artery dissection after an intense workout that morning/ she tore a vertebral artery in her neck which she immediately clotted and led to her having a stroke. The patient had vertigo, nausea and weakness on 08Mar2021 and went to the ER and they found she had a thrombolytic stroke in the cerebellum as a result of the vertebral artery dissection. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 08Mar2021 then she was discharged 11Mar2021. While she was in the hospital, they did an MRI and found two sub-acute thrombolytic strokes or blood clots in her brain. The patient tore the artery in her neck which led to the right cerebellar stroke; her blood was really clotty but they could tell by the imaging that the two subacute blood clots that led to having the other two strokes were there approximately three weeks before but not much older than that (without exhibiting symptoms, so she had three thrombotic strokes in total). Since she was discharged she has been out of work and will be on FML for two to three months and going to physical therapy from the effects of the strokes. Adds while she was in the hospital they were trying to determine the cause of the two sub-acute strokes that were unrelated to the dissection. They did several tests including: EKG which was normal; TEE scope down her throat to look at her heart which was normal; and blood work to check for a clotting disorder which was also all normal.  So far nothing has been found. Outcome of mild chills, body aches, and sore arm was recovered on 06Mar2021; outcome of vertebral artery dissection and right cerebellar stroke was recovering; while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

A 39 years old female patient (no pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899), intramuscular on 16Dec2020 10:15 at the first single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000).  The patient experienced rught MCA stroke on 25Dec2020 06:15. Seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization, life threatening. The patient was hospitalized for rught MCA stroke for 3 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 25Dec2020.  The patient received unspecified treatment  for rught MCA stroke.

A 38-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 13:00 at single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included heart attack from Apr2019 to an unknown date, covid-19 from Jul2020 to an unknown date (really sick with it). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient got the first COVID19 vaccine and a few days after started having chest pain on 02Jan2021 at 1:00AM, event was serious per medically significant. She went to the doctor and they did an EKG on 08Jan2021. The EKG said she had a heart attack. The heart attack was about the time she had chest pain after the first injection. Patient called her doctor on Monday, 04Jan2021. She had a televideo appointment on 06Jan2021. She went to the doctor&#39;s office and had EKG on 08Jan2021 and was sent to the hospital. She didn&#39;t get admitted because there were no beds. Outcome of the event chest pain, she would say she had recovered on 02Jan2021 with lasting effects because she was in the hospital again for the same thing. She went to the hospital the second time for chest pain that woke her up on 11Jan2021. It started at like 3AM. She thought it was heart burn. She tried to go back to sleep. It continued while she was at work. She told her supervisor who sent her to the hospital. They did not admit her. They did do an EKG on 11Jan2021 and it was abnormal, but not indicative of heart attack. Thought it was gastritis. Her doctor thought the heart attack was on the 02Jan2021. The same thing happened with her heart and she had a heart attack in Apr2019. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient stated she didn&#39;t go to the ER, but called doctor&#39;s office on the following Monday. There was no adverse event following prior vaccinations. Outcome of event chest pain was recovered with sequel, and outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the events chest pain and heart attack cannot be excluded. The events are confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying cardiovascular conditions. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This was confirmed many times by EKGs and lasted 4.5 hours with HR ranging from 8-173 at rest. I was given a medication, Diltiazem 30 mg tab, and my heart rate regulated. Many tests were completed at ER and so far, no known cause for this event has been determined based on test findings. So symptoms lasted from 5pm to 9:45pm. Given medication which resolved the Afib. Stayed at ER running tests until 3:30am.

Then, per patient: &#34;Almost 2 weeks to the day after getting my first shot, on Friday 2/26, I suddenly and unexpectedly went into Rapid Ventricular Response atrial fibrillation. I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.  I do not have a cardiac history.&#34;

The patient medical history included five weeks postpartum; concomitant medications were not reported. On 19Mar2021 the patient experienced bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery that was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. These events required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and were described as follows: patient was five weeks postpartum and was exclusively breastfeeding the newborn. Her body was no longer expelling lochia/blood after the fourth weeks postpartum, however, the day after the vaccine, she began bleeding heavily. This continued on for four days. Her midwife said that ovulation and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery was highly unusual if exclusively breastfeeding. She didn&#39;t attribute to the vaccine until researching on a postpartum message board on What to Expect that there were other anecdotal claims of similar experiences. She would love to speak with someone about what this side effect could possibly mean for her future reproductive health and that if her newborn son.No treatment given; patient was recovering from bleeding heavily and starting a menstrual cycle within weeks of delivery.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021331585 baby case

                                                Lethargy, impaired cognitive function began on 3/29.  By the morning of 3/30, the lethargy and cognitive function is back to normal. Slight headache, low fever and slight chest pain began. Felt better by the afternoon of 3/30 once I took ibuprofen. That evening at approximately 7 pm, I noticed my heart rate was high. My resting HR is about 70, but my HR was at 125 - 130 and I was not exerting myself and was sitting. My HR remained high after I went to bed, and chest pain became worse. By 12:30 am on 3/31, chest pain was getting severe and had pain in both arms. Went to ER at around 3 am on 3/31. Later learning I had a mild heart attack. Had EKG, Blood work, ECG, and Heart Catheritazion. No blockage and normal results except blood work. Blood work showed elevated enzymes.  While in the ER, I was given blood thinner and glycerin tablets, aspirin. Since 4/2, my heart rate and blood pressure have returned to their norm without medication.  I once again have perfect blood pressure readings and perfect HR.  I have returned to normal daily activities as of 4/4.

It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

This 39-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 18Dec2020 14:30 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient experienced internal brain bleeding and brain damage on 30Dec2020 07:30 after 1st dose covid vaccine. Brain surgery received on 29Dec2020. Events were still recovering. Patient was confused and suffering memory loss on 30Dec2020 07:30. Events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Prolongation of existing hospitalization (vaccine received during existing hospitalization), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. Days for hospitalization was 16. The patient received treatment for events as brain surgery due to internal brain bleeding. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported internal brain bleeding and brain damage with confused and memory loss more likely represented intercurrent disease, and less likely causally related to 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

                                                convulsing uncontrollably; stroke; rash; chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it; her throat felt like it was on fire; shaking uncontrollably/ arms and legs were shaking; Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate; Stuttering; dysphagia; tongue was falling to the side/mile was droopy on the right side/right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go/right leg was almost paralyzed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient herself). A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, it was reported that the patient experienced &#34;a sense of her throat swelling&#34; and hives 1 hour after the vaccination occurred. The patient received 1 dose of Benadryl and Tylenol and &#34;felt ok.&#34; The physician commented that the patient did not have full anaphylaxis and was asking if it would be safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine at the time of report. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 39 year old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201,Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in right deltoid on 01Mar2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6201, Expiry date: Unknown) via intramuscular in left deltoid on 01Feb2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing lung cancer from 03Jul2017, metastatic disease from lung cancer from: Dec 2018 and hypertension from: 2007. Concomitant medication included Losartan at 100 mg once a day tablet for blood pressure, Atorvastatin at 80 mg a day tablet for cholesterol, Lorbrena from 26Jun2019 at 100 mg once a day tablet for lung cancer, vitamin D3 at 3000 IU once a day gel cap and coq10 supplement at 100mg and all the drugs were ongoing. The patient did not receive any vaccination 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. No AEs (adverse events) following prior vaccination. The patient started feeling better around 27Feb2021. The patient was a cancer patient, and took marijuana and CBD which helps her sleep. The patient had pain in the serratus anterior the next morning 08Feb2021 and by the 11Feb2021 she had the massive bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso and lasted for about 3 weeks. The patient medicated herself with CBD and marijuana tincture and she would occasionally take Ibuprofen. The patient was thinking COVID vaccine can cause a variety of things. The patient got the second dose on 01Mar2021 in her right arm. The morning after the patient got her vaccine, experienced pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle. As a treatment drug the patient received Tylenol and felt it masked the pain and was fine and still a little sore in the muscular distribution which was on and off mildly sore, not bad and states that the patient recovered with lasting effects. The patient started to have a slight cough, that the patient not had a cough in over a year and a half due to lung cancer and did not think it was lung cancer. The cough first time started to get a little worse, and that day was very cold and when the patient tried to walk around her boyfriends house and started jogging, the patient could not take a deep breath and could not expand ribcage because there was immense pain on 06Mar2021. As a treatment therapy the patient received some CBD and went to sleep, and this lasted about 2 days and after that it got a little better. The patient was improved but had slight lasting effects. The patient experienced cough the whole next week which got worse and was so bad and it was productive. The patient had stress urinary incontinence and was back on her pee pads that she had not been on for years. The patient palpated her left arm pit and felt an enlarged lymph node on Saturday 13Mar2021. On 15Mar2021 the patient would be two weeks since the patient was fully vaccinated and have seen reports that the vaccine causes lymphadenopathy. The patient found the lymph node and called her oncologist because she was worried about the worsening cough. The patient also reached to a Nurse Practitioner and the only thing that worried her was the cough, that she has not seen this in the data so far. The Nurse Practitioner sent her to have a chest x-ray on 18Mar2021 and it showed pleural effusion and fluid in her pleural space around her lungs. The patient had a thoracentesis 19Mar2021 to drain the fluid and they tested it and it was cancer. The patient seems to her there was a correlation with getting the COVID vaccine. On 22Mar2021, the patient got CT Scans of progression in her body and states the pleural effusion had been drained and was less but was still there. The patient felt weird all weekend and thought it was the thoracentesis that caused her anxiety and on 23Mar2021 and had neurological symptoms and thought that the patient had a stroke or something because she has had that in the past. The patient was all related to her lung cancer. The patient called her neuro oncologist and they said to go to ER (emergency room) on 23Mar2021. The patient had newfound brain cancer, and it was worsening, that it was only found Tuesday. The patient underwent brain MRI on 23Mar2021. This was new worsening disease, before it was stable and not getting worse or better, it was not active in the brain and felt a little nervous all the side effects after she got it. The outcome of the event Extreme bone and muscle pain spanning over left upper torso, Pain in the right side under the ribcage muscle in the serratus anterior muscle was recovering and the outcome of all the other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to BNT162b2 and can be attributed to intercurrent conditions in this patient with underlying lung cancer, metastatic disease from lung cancer and other comorbidities.

On the morning of April 10th I awoke to feeling severely winded as if I had run 18 marathons just to walk up 3 steps or to walk across a room.  I was taken to the ER where they performed a catscan on me and could see that my lungs were ?full? of blood clots and I was experiencing a pulmonary embolism.  I do not smoke, take birth control pills, I do not drink.  There is no family history of clotting, nor did any traumatic incident happen within the last two weeks to cause this.

                                                Mild anaphylaxis--tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway; This is a spontaneous report received from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot was unknown due to not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Mar2021 at age of 39-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included eczema, known allergies: Food sensitives including gluten and dairy. Rashes with prolonged skin contact with metals or adhesives. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No COVID prior vaccination. COVID was not tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylaxis-tongue swelling as well as occlusion of airway on 19Mar2021. Started about 2min after shot. Occlusion lasted for 7minutes. EMS said vitals were normal. Swollen tongue lasted 24 hours. Have never had an allergic response to any vaccine before. The events were non-serious. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of anaphylaxis was recovered in 2021, of tongue swelling was recovered on 20Mar2021, of occlusion of airway was recovered on 19Mar2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event anaphylaxis cannot be totally excluded.
