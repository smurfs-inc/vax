A 27-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; received at a nursing home/senior living facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Medical history included COVID-19 from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included unspecified birth control taken for an unspecified indication from an unknown date to an unknown date; within two weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: syncope episode in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, unconscious in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, fever and chills on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, blood pressure was low, about 90/50  on 09Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, did not feel well in Jan2021 with outcome of unknown; all of which were assessed as medically significant. The clinical course was reported as follows: the fever and chills began about one hour after vaccination (as reported). About 18 hours after the vaccination, the patient was getting up to take more paracetamol (TYLENOL) and did not feel well. The patient had a syncope episode in the bathroom (no issues as she sat on the floor before hand). The patient was unconscious for about 1-2 minutes. The patient&#39;s blood pressure several minutes later was low, about 90/50; however, the patient took the blood pressure measurement herself, so it may not have been exactly accurate. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: low, about 90/50 on 09Jan2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of fever. Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all reported serious events cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information Requested on Lot/ Batch number.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported faint was most likely due to an accident, and less likely causally related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

On Jan. 21st, 2021, I woke up feeling feverish.  I went to use the bathroom, and after washing my hands I walked towards the bathroom door and felt light-headed and dizzy.  Suddenly, I passed out and hit my head and upper neck on the tile floor.  My parents heard the sound of my fall and luckily rushed to the bathroom.  They found me lying  unconscious on the floor with my eyes rolled up for what felt like more than a minute.  I regained consciousness on my own, and I drank water with a bit of sugar and salt mixed in.    I felt too weak to get up and walk, and the back of my head and upper neck were in pain.  I told my parents to call 911 as I wanted to make sure that there was no serious damage to my brain or neck area.  I went to the local hospital in an ambulance.  I was taken to the emergency room: Vitals were done and my temperature ranged from then was 99.5-101F and my heart rate was high- it stayed around 112 bpm for some time I was given 2 L of IV Saline Fluids EKG result: no clinical abnormalities CT head/neck/spine: negative 2 different types of COVID-19 tests: results were both negative Bloodwork: CBC/BMP/D-dimer: no clinical abnormalities Chest Xray: negative 2D- doppler ultrasound: negative Holter monitor: negative for irregular heart rhythm I was discharged the same day around 4:30pm

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

This A 30-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EH9899), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 22Dec2020 09:00 for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included reaction to pork, porsine and/or if she ever was exposed to exposed to heparin. There were no concomitant medications. On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced syncope (medically significant), dizziness (medically significant), feeling faint; like going to pass out now and then (medically significant), overall achiness, severe headaches, fever. The outcome of the events syncope, dizziness, feeling faint; like going to pass out now was recovering and outcome of overall achiness, severe headaches, fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The patient ask: are there any animal products, pork gelatin or a lipid form of that contain in the vaccine?   The events were described as follows: She experienced a significant amount of syncope and dizziness, for greater than 4 or 5 days post-receiving the vaccination. Also feeling faint like she is going to pass out every now and then. Has a more important question, wondering along with the doctors if one of the ingredients may have an animal product, like pork gelatin or a lipid form of that. It looks like one of the ingredients may have an animal cell lipid and was wondering if she was having a reaction to that. Declines to provide primary care provider details. States she received this first dose at occupational health in her workplace. Received the vaccine on the 22Dec2020 at 9am. 24 hours post vaccination, 1 day after, the syncope, dizziness, feeling faint started. Also the other symptoms, overall achiness, severe headaches, and fever were also experienced, but they stopped after that 24 hours. Those were expected since it was listed as side effects that popped up, so she expected those and they stopped after 24 hours. The syncope, dizziness, and faint feeling are not any worse and are very slowly improving, but she still has it and had to call out of work today because of it. That&#39;s consistent. Mentions it takes her a while to get down the stairs when getting product details for the COVID-19 vaccine. Unable to provide the vaccine NDC or expiry, or dose. Did not have any other vaccines at time of this one and none 4 weeks prior. Had to call a (company withheld) doctor and has to go to occupational health tomorrow to be seen. Declines having COVID virus. No further details provided.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events syncope and dizziness are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

                                                Approximately 12 days after vaccination co began to have fatigue, weakness, Pancytopenia      Recent hospitalization which involved initial presentation at hospital on AK 12/29, and then again on 12/30, after eval on 12/30 was then transferred to another hospital, and later transferred where she later recovered and was discharged.      She was initially very ill and was thought to have sepsis due to fever/initial presentation/clinical picture, also had lab abnormalities including thrombocytopenia.  These things necessitated transfer.  While at hospital, hematology was consulted.  Decision was made to transfer due to concern for DIC/possibility of leukemia. Also there was concern for C Diff, treatment was given for this.  While in hospital, she underwent further testing on blood samples which revealed no evidence for malignancy, also bone marrow biopsy was performed.  While there, DIC labs were trended/began to improve.  Discharged on 1/5/21.  Had f/u with hematology @ hospital on 1/12/21.  No reason has been found as of yet as to why she became ill.  Per discharge note it&#39;s thought it could have been viral in nature, or possibly related to supplement use.  Will f/u with heme in early Feb.   Of note, she does report getting her first dose of pfizer covid vaccine on 12/17/20, she reports concern that this could have played a part in her illness.  She states this was the only new/out of the ordinary thing that she can remember recently, regarding her medical hx, prior to recent acute illness/hospitalization. Requests I reach out to inquire how she can file a report with Pfizer or CDC

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

Developed b/l hand swelling and tingling, diffuse hives and itching, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, lips tingling and swelling which required emergency room visit and EpiPen, IV fluids, Benadryl and IV steroids. This is similar to previous reactions I have had to running previously. Symptoms resolved within one hour after treatment in ED.

The fever lasted 18 hours.  She also complained of severe malaise and fatigue lasting 36 hours.  On day 3 (Friday, January 15, 2021) she developed left lower extremity pain that persisted over the weekend.  She was seen in Urgent Care today where she was diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis of the proximal vein. She also came to the ETC and was ruled out for a PE.  The employee does have a family history of antiphospholipid in her mother. She has a follow up with her PCP and will also receive a work up in hematology as she had never been tested for any genetic coagulation conditions after her mom&#39;s diagnosis.

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

Medical history included: Allergy.  Concomitant medication included drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (YASMIN) for Birth control, chlorphenamine maleate (PIRITON) for Allergy.  The patient was perfectly fine up until about the 3 hours after the vaccine, she started salivating really bad, she was not throwing up or nauseas or anything, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s lot of drool, like she even had just go over sink as just salivating so much it was weird, and her heart rate started pounding and she passed out and almost broke her arm, so and then she kind of like blacked out and don&#39;t remember anything for rest of the evening. The events onset date was on 26Jan2021 08:30. No treatment was received. The outcome of events was recovered in Jan2021.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cefazolin and levaquin and experienced allergies to both. The patient has a Mirena IUD and never get her period at all. Within 6 hours of her first Pfizer injection (02Feb2021 16:00), the patient experienced crippling lower abdominal pain followed by very very heavy bleeding and clotting. Resolved within 48 hours as quickly as it came and didn&#39;t occur with second dose 1 week out. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The events were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On Saturday (13Feb2021), she had shortness of breath and the urge to vomit (nausea), she was about to faint. She was also dizzy and checked her blood pressure, it was &#34;high&#34;, around 129/88, but she can&#39;t recall the values exactly. She doesn&#39;t know if she should get the second dose because she&#39;s scared. The patient wanted to know if these are symptoms from the vaccine or could it have been a reaction or allergy. She is scheduled for the second dose on 04Mar2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

A 35-year-old female patient (no pregnancy) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine, lot number: EL9267), intramuscularly at site of left arm at 16:30 on 16Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (closed 12 years ago with NO sequelae). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine and valacyclovir [valaciclovir], both received within two weeks of vaccine. The patient had 4 mm left frontal lobe stroke without any other known etiology on testing (heme, cardio, neuro consulting/workup) at 13:15 on 20Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized for this event for 2 days.

I was taken to a separate area and felt warm and flush in my chest. They laid me down on the cot and said I looked pale. My hands were cold and within minutes I was shaking uncontrollably. I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

She complained of feeling very hot and with mental confusion. We administered 50 mg of diphenhydramine, and 15 minutes later sent her to the ED. At the ED they diagnosed her with a minor anaphylaxis reaction, gave her methylprednisolone and epinephrine.

A 36-year-old female patient received the second dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 at 14:45 at 36-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  Medical history included Wilms tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Kidney resection and chemo from 1986 to an unknown date, sulfonamide allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899) for COVID-19 immunization on 21Dec2020. On 12Jan2021 at 04:00, the patient experienced vasovagal syncope with asystole (hospitalization, medically significant).  The patient was hospitalized for vasovagal syncope with asystole on unknown dates for 4 days (at the time of the report). It was reported that the patient did not receive any treatment due to the events. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient experienced what was believed to be a vasovagal syncope with asystole; approximately 12 hours after receiving the second dose. The patient had been admitted to the hospital since all cardiac diagnosis tests were negative for structural or functional abnormalities. The patient remained in-patient at this time for initiation of therapy for frequent PVCs, which were diagnosis about one year ago; but chose not to treat at that time, as the symptoms were not affecting her lifestyle. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included cardiac diagnosis tests: negative for structural or functional abnormalities on an unknown date.  The clinical outcome of the events was recovering. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination; and was not tested for COVID post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 in the development of the vasovagal syncope with asystole cannot be excluded. The event is confounded by the patient&#39;s underlying premature ventricular contractions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name). Events visit to Emergency Room. They did a CBC and she was in normal range for everything. Lab data included on 20Jan2021: CBC normal. Outcome of the event Swollen tongue was recovering.  Outcome of the event Anaphylactic reaction/anaphylaxis was recovered.  Outcome of the event injection site soreness was not recovered. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL8982, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Jan2021 12:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products.The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.On 21Jan2021, exactly &#34;4 1/2 days&#34; after vaccine the patient experienced fainting like episodes, blurred vision, severe vertigo, chest pain, fatigue. The patient has been out of work since the 20th and she still had blurred vision. The adverse event resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received. The patient was not recovered from the events. She has been to the ER, cardiologist for an echography, ultrasonography of thyroids, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her head, went to ENT dr and neurologist in 2021. All blood work in 2021 came back normal as well. The reporter considered the event as non-serious. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. She had negative Nasal Swab Covid test post vaccination on 22Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of fainting like episodes cannot be fully excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 36-years-old; Batch/Lot number and expiry date were not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient fainted on 02Mar2021 and recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.  More information such as complete medical history and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.

A 38-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at 38-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood clotting disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: my heart rate, I was like in AFib (medically significant) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, very high fever of 103 (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, dizzy, light headed (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, arms sore (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, exhausted like an extreme fatigue (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, palpitations (non-serious) on 31Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered.  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated, &#34;the day after the shot I got a very high fever of 103. I was dizzy, lightheaded. My heart rate I was like in AFib, it was going from 60s to 50s all over the place. And this was the next day after the vaccination. That evening nothing my arms was just sore. But the next day all of these side effects just started in and even still today I just feel so exhausted like an extreme fatigue and I am still getting like palpitations.&#34; The patient stated, &#34;So I went to urgent care and they check my vitals and stuff and when they wanted me to send me to the hospital. But I told them I will get a ride and I go by myself just because I didn&#39;t want, capable of an ambulance ride and I ended up just going home because I couldn&#39;t get a hold up anybody. So, I came home and took my blood thinner medication because I do have blood clotting disorder.&#34;  In regard to the outcomes of the events, the patient stated, &#34;I am not experiencing all of them still definitely my heart is much better. I am still getting palpitations but nothing near how it was that first day. I am experiencing extreme fatigue.&#34;

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported experiencing throat swelling, face and lip tingling. Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

A 39 years old female patient (no pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899), intramuscular on 16Dec2020 10:15 at the first single dose at right arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3 1000).  The patient experienced rught MCA stroke on 25Dec2020 06:15. Seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization, life threatening. The patient was hospitalized for rught MCA stroke for 3 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 25Dec2020.  The patient received unspecified treatment  for rught MCA stroke. The outcome of event was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The subject had medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease.

It seemed unusual but nothing I couldn&#39;t handle or out of control.  I just wish they had informed me so I would have taken extra care when handling the knife.  I&#39;m not sure if this was related to the vaccine but I had never bleed that long before so I wanted to report it as a potential side effect.  I still think benefits of vaccine outweigh risk involved with vaccine so I am glad to have had the shot.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient). This is the second of two cases and refers to events occurred with the second dose of the vaccine.  A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot EL1283), on 11Jan2021 at 11:00 at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, shellfish allergy, allergy lobster (used steroids). Patient was not pregnant.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Previously on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM patient took the first dose of the vaccine (Lot EJ1685) at single dose in Deltoid Left for COVID-19 immunization and couple of days after she had nausea and something stuck in her throat. On 11Jan2021, 5 minutes after the 2nd dose (at 11:05), the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, that required Emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLUMEDROL) and &#34;Pepcid&#34;: she was prescribed 3-day course of oral prednisone and H2 antihistamine oral &#34;Pepcid&#34;. After finished it, she felt it was coming back therefore she took diphenhydramine hydrochloride for 2 nights in a row. She did not experience any respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestation. She completely recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of anaphylactic reaction  due to temporal relationship.   There is limited information provided in this report.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                did not have full anaphylaxis; a sense of her throat swelling; hives; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 39-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, it was reported that the patient experienced &#34;a sense of her throat swelling&#34; and hives 1 hour after the vaccination occurred. The patient received 1 dose of Benadryl and Tylenol and &#34;felt ok.&#34; The physician commented that the patient did not have full anaphylaxis and was asking if it would be safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine at the time of report. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.
