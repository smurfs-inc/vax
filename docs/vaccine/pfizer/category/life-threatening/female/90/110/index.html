A 92-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 92-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Ongoing medical history included nursing home resident, admitted to hospice on 13Jan2021 (prior to vaccination), and oxygen supplementation (due to low oxygen levels) from a few days prior to the vaccine (Jan2021). Other relevant medical history included congestive heart failure from Dec2020 and sulfa allergy. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was tested numerous times (as reported) for COVID-19 and was negative.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. A few days before the vaccination, her oxygen level had gone down, and she had been placed on oxygen. Prior to receiving the vaccine, the patient was reported as being &#39;fine&#39;. On 13Jan2021, the patient received the vaccine at 11:00. The patient coughed maybe 5 or 6 times and then dropped her head. Resuscitation was not performed as patient had a do not resuscitate (DNR) order. The patient passed away on 13Jan2021 at 13:05. The cause of death was not reported. An autopsy was not performed. The clinical outcome of the cough was unknown at the time of death.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: passed away

                                                My mother died on February 19, 2021. She had her 2nd dose vaccine on 2/11, on 2/12 it was noted that she was not able to walk, on 2/13 she was walking at 30%, on 2/14 she was walking with difficulty, on Monday 2/15 she was throwing up violently and her blood pressure dropped, so she was sent to Clinic. My sister was told she was just constipated and she had A Fib (never reported before to us). My sister was then told on 2/16 early a.m. that she had a blood clot that destroyed her colon. Due to age surgery would likely not be successful. She then died on the Friday. We are reporting in the event that the Pfizer vaccine was somehow a contributing factor to the A fib or to the Clot. She has no history of A fib or clotting prior to this incident. She was 93, and did have dementia, but was able to eat normal foods prior to this. What was unusual was the challenge in walking the day after the shot. Other than that no difference was observed until the day she was admitted to the hospital emergency room. She was a resident at Assisted Living, Memory Care, and that is where she received the vaccine. The mailing address I provided is her mailing address prior to death.

Labs shows, sodium 134, potassium 3.6, bicarb 28, BUN 18, creatinine 0.97, glucose 119, WBC 12.5, hemoglobin 11.8, platelet 239.  PT INR 1.09, COVID negative. CT head suggestive of subacute infarct. Possible including small vessel ischemic changes. Chest xray questionable patchy left retrocardiac atelectasis or pneumonia. EKG shows atrial fibrillation&#39;s heart rate 71, QTc 610.  Case was discussed with neurology in the ED, patient was not a TPA or embolectomy candidate. CT head suggestive of acute/subacute cerebellar infarct.  Patient does not have any residual or sensory deficit except expressive aphasia. Neuro saw patient,  mentioned patient appears to have had a stroke that by the CAT scan criteria is already subacute.  The patient was admitted on the stroke pathway.   The patient has new onset atrial fibrillation and therefore should be considered for anticoagulation.  The patient cannot have an MRI of the brain due to her spinal cord stimulator but given that the stroke is already subacute on the CT without any signs of hemorrhagic conversion she could be started on this at this point.  If she gets started on anticoagulation the aspirin should be stopped. If the patient cannot go on anticoagulation or does not want to then she might be a candidate for dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention. 2D echo shows normal ejection fraction of the left ventricle estimated at 70 to 75%.  Regional wall motion abnormality was not observed.  Right ventricle systolic function is normal.  Moderate aortic stenosis. Cardio was consulted for anticoagulation,  From cardioembolic prevention standpoint, anticoagulation is recommended to prevent CVA. However, she has significant risks for bleeding given recent vaginal bleeding (investigation not pursued to spare her comfort), age, comorbidities, etc. Again, further discussion between family and primary team is required regarding risks vs benefits. Was evaluated by speech-language pathology present minimal oral dysphagia no overt clinical signs of aspiration, recommended to continue with NDD 2 diet/thin liquid. Patient was discharged to ECF.

That next morning early, she had a 911 event at her assisted living apartment and was sent back to the hospital, having had another heart attack. Patient died on the following Thursday, February 4, 2021. I do not know if the vaccination had any cause for my mothers death; but I feel it is necessary to report this series of heart attacks after she received the pfizer vaccine.

A 94-year-old female patient (mother) received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot# EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 13:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke in Aug2019, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cholesterol, myalgia condition, blood pressure, thyroid, sleep and vertigo. The patient concomitant medications included amlodipine for blood pressure, calcium carbonate/colecalciferol (CALCIUM &#43; VITAMIN D), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) for cholesterol, levothyroxine for thyroid, eszopiclone (LUNESTA) for sleep medication, ascorbic acid, cupric oxide, dl-alpha tocopheryl acetate, xantofyl, zeaxanthin, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION AREDS 2), prednisone for myalgia condition, and escitalopram. The patient experienced fatigue, joint ache, nausea, vomiting, blood pressure 170/130, fever 100.1, stress, stroke like symptoms, numbness in her lip, momentary confusion; like she was having a TIA;  not able to answer questions, tired, pervasive aching, all on 23Jan2021 19:00. Events reported as follow: patient had the Pfizer vaccine on Saturday around 1 pm and Saturday (Clarified 23Jan2021) night she had severe side effects for about 4 hours. When probed for side effects, the reporter stated it increased gradually over time. So, first patient had joint achiness and then she experienced nausea and vomiting. The reporter took her blood pressure. It was 170/130 and so reporter called EMS and they came up and her blood pressure had gone back down to normal and they recorded she had a fever of 100.1. EMS believed that the combination of the &#39;violence&#39; of the onset and the fever caused her blood pressure to spike but she had a history of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. So, the reporter was concerned that the stress and whatever that was going on the reaction, the reporter was concerned that it was going to cause her a stroke. Patient had 2 stroke like symptoms, one was that she had numbness in her lip and the second was that she had momentary confusion, like she was having a TIA (reporter confirmed TIA as Transient ischemic attack). The only symptom of that was when the reporter asked her the name of her children she gave the names of her grandchildren but that confusion cleared up quickly and she was fine for a while but not able to answer questions, sharply. By the time that EMS got there patient was sharp again, no problem. For treatment, the reporter gave patient aspirin. The reporter put some Salonpas patches on her joints. It was like the analgesic patch. It was an external patch that patient put on. Patient usually does not need them that was why she was taking the prednisone to treat that kind of pervasive aching. The reporter also gave her the fluids, Gatorade kind of stuff to replace her fluids from throwing up and that kind of stuff. One more thing, it all started with an extreme fatigue but that seem normal but it seemed to lead into the other symptoms. Like it was a big day to go out and get the vaccine. So, she was a little bit tired. This was a very deep fatigue that was part of it too. Reporter stated only 81 aspirin (later clarified as treatment) as she could not go back on blood thinners because she had the hemorrhagic stroke. As of 11Feb2021, it was reported that patient still has not recovered her strength since 23Jan2021 19:00 and was reported as ongoing but improved. On 03Feb2021, the patient had vertigo that stayed for five days and was now improved. The patient was scheduled for the second dose on 13Feb2021. The immediate effects her mother had after the first dose of the vaccine were pain at the injection site; fatigue; fever; nausea. Mentions she also had some confusion and they were worried that the patient might be having another stroke. But all of this cleared up; all of this in a violent episode that lasted about four hours. Today she wants to report that her it took her a week for her mother to recover. Adds her mother could walk for half an hour before the vaccine but since the vaccine she still has not recovered her strength. Adds her mother has only been able to walk about 15 minutes with a walker and resting a lot, for a couple time in three weeks and this was their main way of maintaining her health. Adds her mother also had some vertigo last week that stayed for five days but she has had that in the past. Adds actually she still has the vertigo a little and she can tell when her mother bends her head. Outcome of blood pressure 170/130, she still has not recovered her strength and vertigo was recovering, outcome of events pain at the injection site, fatigue, fever, nausea and confusion was recovered on 23Jan2021 23:00; other events was unknown. No investigation assessment.  Follow-up (11Feb2021): New information received from the same contactable consumer (patient&#39;s daughter) includes: reporter details, medical history, reaction data and course of events.

There were no concomitant medications.  Patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not receive other medications in two week. The patient previously took amikacin sulfate (NOVACIN) and experienced drug allergy. In 2021, patient developed multiple ecchymotic/purpuric skin lesions on extremeties and trunk 1-2 weeks after vaccination. Platelet count 9k. No anemia. Normal WBC. Oncologist diagnosis vaccine induced severe ITP (Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). Admitted to Hospital 20Feb2021. Ongoing treatment.  The patient was hospitalized for the events from 20Feb2021 to 25Feb2021 for 5 days hospitalisation. No Covid tested post vaccination.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included platelet count: 9k in 2021, white blood cell count: normal in 2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events (IV Decadron, IVIG). The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura due to temporal relationship.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 95-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 10:15 at SINGLE DOSE in left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) with lot number: EL3249 on 20Jan2021 in right arm. After receiving the 2nd dose on 10Feb2021, the patient became ill on 11Feb2021, while sitting on the toilet, she became nauseous and vomiting repeatedly even dry heaves also then became dizzy and felt a tingling in my face and right hand didn&#39;t feel like the patient could get up on her own so the patient&#39;s son and daughter assisted her to her bed. She didn&#39;t know what was wrong and her daughter thought it was a side effect of the vaccine and called the nurse on call. After arriving at the emergency and was examined the patient was told she was being kept for observation since she had just had the vaccine. The patient was later told she also had a mild heart attack and to her knowledge I never had any heart issues. She could then no longer use her walker to walk because she couldn&#39;t bear weight on her right hand. She was hospitalized for 8 days and transferred to rehab and I&#39;m still in rehab. The events were assessed as serious (hospitalized and disability). The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient received treatment for the events.

                                                This 96 year old resident was diagnosed with COVID on 10/28/2020. She has a significant, complicated medical history and  did not return to her pre-infection level of health. She began declining in early  January and was made care and comfort measures only on 1/2/2021.  Most of her medications were d/c&#39;d except for those that provided comfort.  No obvious reaction to the vaccine was seen and we do not suspect that her death was vaccine related, however we were directed by Dept of Epidemiology to report her death as it was within one week of receiving the vaccine.

                                                Excerpt taken from patient&#39;s medical record notes.    Recreational Therapist was in room with patient who was at baseline mentation at that time, and was getting patient a cup of tea.  Rec Therapist observed patient to &#34;all of a sudden slouch down toward left side&#34; and became unresponsive.  Therapist called for help, and Registered Nurse (RN) and Certified Nurse Aide (CNA) came into room.  Patient was initially non-responsive and profusely sweating and hot to touch.  Vitals  were taken (see below).  The patient then slowly became responsive after approximately 4 minutes and was visibly nauseous  and appeared like she was going to vomit, but ultimately did not.  Patient was assisted into bed, APRN was called, order for vital signs to be taken every 4 hours for 72 hours, and Electrocardiogram (EKG) to be performed.   EKG results were abnormal, indicative of infarct; APRN ordered transport to Emergency Department.   Patient returned from Hospital ED at approximately 10:45 PM same day (1/28/21), with transfer paperwork documenting  a  Hospital diagnosis of &#34;Syncope&#34; without any additional lab results or any new medication or treatment orders in the documentation.  Follow up the next day (1/29/21) by RN at the Nursing Facility--RN logged into the Hospital medical Charting system, only to find that there was no record whatsoever of the patient being in the Emergency Department on 1/28/21--no notes, no labs, no summary from a practitioner.  Patient recovered and has resumed close-to-baseline activity and functioning.

                                                The above info is available but it is as my mothers....She had a bad reaction ( very flu like for several days). I proceeded with second shot in February....she did not feel well, but just sorta didn&#39;t want to get up anymore. She slept more and more and more. Her appetite declined. I got her up and she was ravenous. She slept more and seemed in a lethargic way to take less and less interest. She was living independently and had been most of her life. We scheduled an internist report. She passed labs with flying colors....... when you are 96 they look at everything as remarkable ( will live for 10 more years). I also was not equating any of this with the vaccine. However, we could not ignore it any longer Saturday the 4-10-21. I took her to ER. She was lucid and walking with difficulty. I took her in by ambulance as she was just saying, &#34;I&#39;m so week!&#34; I&#39;m so whoozie! On Sunday they are talking immediate intensive rehab. Neurologist leave for 5 days and in next 48 hours she becomes 200% less. First delusional, then sleeps all day. He showed me an MRI that to a layperson looked like little hives all over the brain ( I had also gotten hives from somewhere on my skin that I originally equated with Covid but no one thought so. I have also had the two shots.) One week out I was looking at Hospic eand long term care placement. Yesterday they couldn&#39;t get a diagnosis for Hospice ( the person sent to sign her up). I thought what? After all these tests and  maybe it is cardio, maybe it is exchemic  strokes, they don&#39;t have a diagnosis because she hasn&#39;t changed much since 2017? We have to take this totally fine independent  woman and in one week say, &#34;She has Dementia?&#34; It&#39;s possible but what caused it? It&#39;s not age......we live until we are 110. Yes, that MRI showed me little formations of clotting all over ( no major bleed if any in a lobe). Over the last week I have been looking at her health and how we just slowly went downhill. It&#39;s easy to blame a vaccine, but still..........I am saying that there were NO OTHER reasons other than she didn&#39;t seem to tolerate the shots well........first was acute, and the second was long term and slow...........

                                                I am the discharging physician and did not admit her but based off the information at admit: the patient received her Pfizer vaccine and developed nausea during her observation time but it was not significant enough to cause concern for the family. They took her home in good spirits and she appeared to be doing well until the evening when she became unresponsive. She developed high fevers and came to the ER with low normal O2 saturations and evidence of sepsis. Blood work showed a markedly elevated white count and an elevated lactic acid of 8 along with an elevated renal function and cardiac enzymes without EKG changes (multiorgan failure). Her COVID test was negative.  Blood and urine cultures were negative. A CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated no acute findings but likely chronic fecal impaction.  CT Head was negative for bleed or stroke. At this time is is unclear as to what was the cause of her symptoms but we believe it was presumed bacterial sepsis but this diagnosis is in question as all her cultures were unremarkable. The family opted on comfort measures rather than aggressive intervention and she was sent home with hospice.  Since it occurred so closely after receiving the vaccine I think it was worthwhile to bring it to your attention.

At 12:00 pm, she complained of worsening fatigue and blurry vision.  At 3:40 pm, she complained of loss of appetite but denied fever and chills.  The niece was unable to reach her by phone after 4 pm, so she came over to the decedent?s residence at 6:15 pm to check on her.  The niece found her lying face up in bed ?gasping for air.?  She then became unresponsive and EMS was called.  The decedent was pronounced at 8:11 pm after unsuccessful resuscitative efforts.  Autopsy showed hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with marked partially calcific coronary atherosclerosis; marked pulmonary edema; and pleural effusions.  The brain was saved for neuropathology given the history of blurry vision.
