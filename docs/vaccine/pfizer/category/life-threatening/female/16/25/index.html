                                                Stroke; severe allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient&#39;s father) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the Right Arm (also reported as: right shoulder) on 23Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) at 16-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included heart valve operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Mechanical heart valves).  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, which was reported as: &#34;Yes she is taking other medication.&#34; On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced stroke and severe allergic reaction (medically significant). The clinical course was reported as follows: On behalf of his 16-year-old daughter, the patient&#39;s father reported that she had the first dose administer in the right shoulder on 23Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient had a stroke.  The patient&#39;s father stated, &#34;our lives have changed, completely.&#34; The patient&#39;s father reported that his daughter was receiving medical care ever since then; and was also being treated by a physician.  The patient&#39;s father was asking about compensation from Pfizer regarding his daughter&#39;s severe adverse event (AE) that occurred after the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s father reported that the case had been submitted by the (Name) healthcare team &#34;to the FDA and to Pfizer, and I haven&#39;t heard back from either.&#34; The patient&#39;s father mentioned in passing, that he &#34;could call (Name) and have this all over the news&#34; but that he &#34;wants to be responsible&#34; and doesn&#39;t want to do that.  The patient&#39;s father stated the concern, &#34;Well my concern I am not sure that medical profession is what I really need to do, my concern is that my daughter took the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 23Mar2021 in (Name) in vaccination location. On 29Mar2021, 6 days later, she had a stroke, and that she is receiving a medical care ever since then , now  my question is like I said probably for  maybe for correlated relation type of person define as well as  for it  there is a compensation for adverse reaction to COVID vaccination being that this was only thing that was introduce in her system as far as doing that time the vaccination shot.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: &#34;that&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34; on an unknown date; also reported: &#34;Yes that&#39;s been ongoing as far as giving blood. That&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34;. Therapeutic measures were not taken and was reported as &#34;no she isn&#39;t taking anything for it.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events, stroke and severe allergic reaction, was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021411875 Pfizer

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

She took the vaccine around 10:00am and around 6:00pm (also reported as 06:30 PM) she noticed that her left foot had swollen. She consulted with her general physician and he requested that patient did an Ultra Sound exam of her left leg. The result of the exam reported a small clot behind her left knee. Therefore, doctor suggested that she reported these events to Pfizer so an evaluation is made to identify if similar events have occurred with other patients. She was concerned if she should take the second shot on 17Apr2021. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient received Eliquis 5mg (two times daily) as treatment. Patient had Nasal Swab on 01Apr2021 and tested negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

                                                Patient fainted and hyporesponsive.; Patient fainted and hyporesponsive.; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other healthcare professional.  A 21-year-old non-pregnant female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot number: En9265, intramuscular on 13Feb2021 at 14:00 (at the age of 21 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient fainted and was hyporesponsive on 13Feb2021. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on vaccine-event chronological association, a causal relationship between events fainted and was hyporesponsive and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

                                                Anaphylaxis.   The COVID shot was given, no reaction then. After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 at 09:30 at a single dose in the workplace clinic for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and history of vasovagal syncope following vaccinations; this adverse reaction to the vaccination directly aligns with other episodes that have occurred to her following vaccinations/interactions with needles (ie. blood draws). The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levonorgestrel (MIRENA). On 25Jan2021 at 09:30 (after getting the vaccine), the patient felt herself losing consciousness, her vision went blurry first and she was able to brace herself by lying down against a wall, and low blood pressure following event (50/20). Blood pressure and pulse rose over the next 25 minutes. 15 minutes more of observation was completed. The patient did not receive treatments for the events. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I had the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on 4/6 and felt dizzy 30 minutes later. The dizziness continued for the next 84 hours. On 4/9 (three days after vaccination), I fainted on my  driveway as I was heading home around noon time. I felt dizzy the whole afternoon but were trying to help out the groceries from the car. I fell down on the concrete driveway with two bags of groceries on my hand. I did not blackout, but were not able to get up for 10 seconds due to the dizziness. I eventually recovered from the dizziness 84 hours after the first dose of vaccine. I injured my knee as I fell, but the wound were treated at home immediately.  As for the sore arm, I could not hold any items heavier than 1 lb. The arm soreness went away after 48 hours with ice pack applied on upper arm(injection area).
