                                                Stroke; severe allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient&#39;s father) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the Right Arm (also reported as: right shoulder) on 23Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) at 16-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included heart valve operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Mechanical heart valves).  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, which was reported as: &#34;Yes she is taking other medication.&#34; On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced stroke and severe allergic reaction (medically significant). The clinical course was reported as follows: On behalf of his 16-year-old daughter, the patient&#39;s father reported that she had the first dose administer in the right shoulder on 23Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient had a stroke.  The patient&#39;s father stated, &#34;our lives have changed, completely.&#34; The patient&#39;s father reported that his daughter was receiving medical care ever since then; and was also being treated by a physician.  The patient&#39;s father was asking about compensation from Pfizer regarding his daughter&#39;s severe adverse event (AE) that occurred after the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s father reported that the case had been submitted by the (Name) healthcare team &#34;to the FDA and to Pfizer, and I haven&#39;t heard back from either.&#34; The patient&#39;s father mentioned in passing, that he &#34;could call (Name) and have this all over the news&#34; but that he &#34;wants to be responsible&#34; and doesn&#39;t want to do that.  The patient&#39;s father stated the concern, &#34;Well my concern I am not sure that medical profession is what I really need to do, my concern is that my daughter took the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 23Mar2021 in (Name) in vaccination location. On 29Mar2021, 6 days later, she had a stroke, and that she is receiving a medical care ever since then , now  my question is like I said probably for  maybe for correlated relation type of person define as well as  for it  there is a compensation for adverse reaction to COVID vaccination being that this was only thing that was introduce in her system as far as doing that time the vaccination shot.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: &#34;that&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34; on an unknown date; also reported: &#34;Yes that&#39;s been ongoing as far as giving blood. That&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34;. Therapeutic measures were not taken and was reported as &#34;no she isn&#39;t taking anything for it.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events, stroke and severe allergic reaction, was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021411875 Pfizer

Her course was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring ICU admission for CPAP), pancytopenia, diarrhea with buttock skin breakdown requiring rectal tube for wound and stool management, and extensive workup which was unrevealing for an infectious cause.  She clinically improved with respect to pancytopenia with discontinuation of felbamate, and completed a treatment course with Zosyn for suspected buttock SSTI.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Last time at the doctors office was for her well check in Oct or Nov. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine.  On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling. They are not sure if it (anaphylactic reaction) is related to the vaccine. She does not have any allergic issues of any kind and is not sure if it is from the vaccine. The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid. She was on steroids for like 4 days. The steroid was prednisone. Outcome of anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing, face swelling were recovered on 21Apr2021. Outcome of anaphylactic reaction was unknown.

A 16-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 25Apr2021 (Lot Number: EWO171) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, Pyle disease, food allergies, short stature, seasonal allergies, peanuts allergies and nuts allergies. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. On 26Apr2021, the patient had elevated temperatures to 104 [unspecified unit], 4-5 days post vaccination (pending clarification) with associated chills and headaches. Thrombocytopenia noted. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was provided for the adverse events. The patient was tested post vaccination with a nasal swab test on 28Apr2021 and the result of negative. The reporter did not consider the events was serious. The outcome of the event was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event thrombocytopenia was observed only 1 day after vaccination.  It is unlikely that thrombocytopenia is related to BNT162B2.  It&#39;s more likely intercurrent medical condition. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She was tested for active COVID-29 infection via nasal swab PCR and tested positive. Upon presentation labs were drawn and her platelet count was found to be 8 on 5/15. Repeat labs were drawn that day to confirm low platelet count and confirmed diagnosis and thrombocytopenia secondary to an immune reaction to the vaccine was suspected. She was admitted and was started on tranexamic acid, medroxyprogesterone, dexamethasone and IV immunoglobulin (Ig) to help treat low platelet count and vaginal bleeding. As of writing, she is still admitted and her most recent platelet count on 5/17 was 16.

Family had given benadryl and zyrtec without improvement, and symptoms were worsening to presents for evaluation.     My exam (after Epipen) showed: Gen: nontoxic appearing; HEENT: no lip/tongue/uvular edema, PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB, no wheezing; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: hives over hands, arms, abdomen, and legs, including between fingers and on soles of feet     Patient presenting with allergic reaction after Covid vaccine, could be more benign allergic reaction such as urticaria multiforme, but given constellation of symptoms and history of severe allergic reaction in past, will treat as anaphylaxis. Therefore given Epipen, steroids, and will plan for observation.   Observed 4 hours and continued to be well appearing without symptoms of rebound anaphylaxis. Therefore, patient safe for discharge to home with supportive care and PCP follow up. Given Rx for benadryl and steroids, refilled Epipein. Family in agreement with plan and verbalize understanding of signs and symptoms to return to care.  Final Diagnosis  1. Anaphylaxis T80.52XA

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Colitis ulcerative from 2014 and ongoing, Genetic immune deficiency, additional Information for other conditions: Caller describes it as &#34;22q&#34;. patient was born with this but wasn&#39;t actually diagnosed until patient was 11 years old. They checked with patient&#39;s Immunologist before getting the vaccine especially with her daughter&#39;s history. Thyroid disease from 2015 to an unknown date, additional Information for other conditions: patient didn&#39;t have a thyroid- her thyroid was removed. Concomitant medications included cetirizine; famotidine; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR); and epinephrine (EPIPEN) all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aloe vera, pramocaine hydrochloride (ATARAX ANTI ITCH LOTION) taken for itching, swelling and hives, start and stop date were not reported. The patient took first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12Mar2021 10:00 (Lot: EN6207) for COVID-19 immunization and patient had no side effects after the first dose. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient just saw her Immunologist and her Immunologist instructed her to report what is going on with patient. Caller clarifies patient&#39;s immunologist plans to call and report as well but also instructed her to call and report the side effects her daughter is experiencing. Her daughter was cleared to have the COVID vaccine. The caller explains they always check with her immunologist because of her daughter&#39;s immune issues. Her daughter received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 02Apr2021. On the evening of 04Apr2021, her daughter broke out in hives. They didn&#39;t think it was a big deal, they thought it was just an allergic reaction. She tried Benadryl and several other things. They went and saw her daughters regular general practitioner and the doctor believed it was just a delayed skin reaction, which seems to be common with the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The doctor told her he&#39;s seen one other person with this delayed reaction. He gave her daughter a steroid injection, a Steroid Dose Pack and Pepcid. She was also placed on Benadryl as needed. About 2 weeks after this, her daughter and lip and face swelling and ended up in the Emergency Room (ER). At this ER visit, they initiated the allergic reaction protocol and it was not an anaphylactic reaction at that point. Her daughter received IV Benadryl and IV steroids, the caller is not sure what else. She confirms she has no NDC, Lot number and expiry dates for the medication her daughter received in the ER. The ER doctor contacted the Immunologist on call and the Immunologist had seen a few cases with a delayed reaction. Caller clarifies the ER doctor discussed her daughter&#39;s delayed skin reaction with the on-call Immunologist. The oncologist put her daughter on generic Zyrtec, 20mg in the morning and 20mg at night. The following week, her daughter woke her up with facial and tongue swelling. She clarifies further her daughter had fever, joint pain, and had broken out in a rash that moved to her face and lips. She immediately took her to the ER. The ER followed the whole anaphylaxis protocol and was given an EpiPen. She explains her daughter was diagnosed serum/covid sickness. This has been going on for over 6 weeks. The reaction will come and go. She was told as her daughter&#39;s body develops immunity, she is basically allergic to it. She clarifies at her ER visits, they checked her daughters liver and kidneys. It was noted her daughter had and elevated CRP, which is an inflammatory marker. The caller was told they thought her daughter had serum sickness from the vaccine which may last 4-6 weeks or it may be prolonged, so they just went with it. They told her as long as it didn&#39;t move to her lips or affect her daughters breathings, eventually it would wax and wane and go away. Her daughter started breaking out on her arms and legs and last Saturday, she woke up and her face was swelling. She clarifies her daughter&#39;s eye started to swell and her tongue. She took her straight to the ER and the ER followed the anaphylaxis protocol and injected her with an EpiPen. They contacted her Immunologist to check and make sure it wasn&#39;t anything else and consulted with the Covid Vaccine Clinic and it was found 3 other patients had this happen. No further details were provided regarding the 3 other patients. Right now, her daughter is on 4 different medications and an EpiPen. They contacted her insurance about her being placed on a biologic because not even the current medications her daughter is on is making everything going away. Caller verifies her daughter was never admitted into the hospital. When she was last seen in the ER Monday, she her daughter was monitored for 4 hours after the EpiPen was administered. The events require a visit to Emergency Room (total of three ER visits) and Physician Office. She known the last/third ER visit was Monday, 17May2021. The second ER visit was 04May2021. She believes the initial/first ER visit was probably a week or so before the second one. She clarifies she broke out in hives on 04 Apr2021 and went to the doctor on 07Apr2021 or 08Apr2021 so the ER visit was around the next week. Since her daughter had such a good response from the EpiPen the ER doctor took pictures before and after. She clarifies the name of the biologic they want to put her daughter on is Xolair, it is a monthly injection. She explains the current cocktail they have her daughter on is not working. She provides the following product information for these 4 medications and EpiPen. Relevant Tests included she knows they are testing for any other thing that it could be to rule it out. She knows they ran a CIS-tray, a complete CIQ , a Histamine release something and Tryptase. She knows they checked her CRP (inflammatory marker) because it was elevated. Every time her daughter went to the ER, they did a CBC and all of that was normal except for the CRP inflammatory marker, however her CRP was normal at the last ER visit. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 17-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, solution for injection, batch/lot number: EW0164, expiration date: Aug2021) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Deltoid Left on 24Apr2021 as DOSE 1, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation (at the age of 17-years-old). The patient&#39;s medical history included nuts allergy and muscle spasms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid (C-VITAMIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported, chlorophyll (CHLOROPHYLL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. after the first dose her daughter experienced spotting (on 25Apr2021) for 4 days and then her menstrual cycle came which lasted 8-10 days of heavy bleeding (30Apr2021). it was so excessive bleeding that patient had to change pads a lot. Caller stated it has slowed down since yesterday. The patient usually only spots the day before she gets her period. When the patient came on her cycle, she bled heavy and could not go to work and was changing her pad every 1-2 hours. The caller had the patient take an iron pill. The patient&#39;s period finally eased up on day 10 and started slowing down. Today, 13May2021 the patient only had to change her pad once. The patient&#39;s second dose is due the 20May2021.  The outcome of event spotting was unknown, whereas the event heavy bleeding was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information was expected.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies. She received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Lot number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administrated on left arm on 14Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM) at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Apr2021 04:00 PM, reported that the 2nd dose of vaccine caused unusual amount of bleeding after needle was removed. The patient had to clean excess blood after the shot. The band aid was soaked with blood. The patient experienced less soreness at the injection site compared to the first vaccine shot. The concern is whether the vaccine was bled out due improper injection. She did not have any other vaccine in four weeks before the covid-19 vaccine dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. She was not having COVID prior to the vaccination, neither was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

                                                I started experiencing pain in my calf on 4/21 that same night of the vaccination.  There was a tight feeling in my knee and every time I took a step with my right leg  there was pain that radiated down my calf. It almost felt like a  muscle pain so I ignored it for a few days. By 4/24 the pain had gotten so bad that I didn&#39;t want to walk anywhere and cried when I walked. My mom came and picked me up and took me to the  urgent care center. They asked me a few questions and told me that I needed to go to the ER to get checked for a blood clot. I went to hospital on 4/24, and an ultrasound of my knee was done. The doctor diagnosed me with a blood clot and told me to stop taking the Xulane which was my birth control at the time. They told me to follow up with my OBGYN and a hematologist. (I had been on my birth control for about 6 months and  I have never had any issues with blood clots and they do not run in my family. The NP is who told me to report my blood clot to the CDC because she is a little suspicious that the shot is where it come from.)

                                                I started having vaginal bleeding on April 14th. The first day, it was the same amount as a regular period. In the days following, the bleeding became very heavy, having me go through a super-sized tampon with a pad every 1 and a half to two hours along with several large blood clots each time changing. On the 15th, I called the on-call nurse for my gynocologist and she said that it might have been from the vaccine and taking birth control, since many patients of hers had called with the same problem. The bleeding continued at this rate all the way until my second dose on April 29th. I saw my primary doctor that day and she tested my hemoglobin, which came up at 10.7, which was slightly anemic. She prescribed an Iron supplement and told me to skip my &#34;period&#34; days and go straight to my next pack of birth control when the one I was using was finished. The next day, I experienced severe nausea, diarrhea, chills, fever-like symptoms, difficulty breathing, and extreme fatigue. I went to the Emergency Room, and they gave me about an IV and a half. They said I had extreme dehydration, and was slightly more anemic than when tested the day before.  Following that day, the bleeding was significantly lighter and then stopped for a few days on the following Thursday when I started my new pack of birth control. I had little to no blood for.a couple days, followed by bloody discharge up until Tuesday night, the 11th of May, when the bleeding started again, being about the same amount as a regular period. I am still currently bleeding at this rate.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0182), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 14May2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received flu shot and experienced nausea. The patient experienced blood clots on an unspecified date, bruises on the legs, she was getting more, she would say they have worsened in May2021, fever on 15May2021, whole body was aching on 15May2021, fatigue on 15May2021, nauseated on 15May2021, and she did get really sick, she was displaying a lot of symptoms on an unspecified date. Patient started having bruises on the legs and thought that it might be related to blood clots. She mentioned that she also experienced the common side effects but she was not concerned of that as people she knew also had those symptoms but was more concerned about the bruising. On patient&#39;s legs, she had a bunch of bruises. Reporter was just really nervous about her daughter&#39;s bruises. When patient was working, she was not noticing, but today patient noticed her legs and said reporter it was a lot of them. Patient did get really sick with her first shot, she had a fever, she couldn&#39;t go to work the next day. Reporter was not sure if the patient should get the second dose on 04Jun2021. Patient&#39;s whole body was aching, she was nauseated, she was displaying a lot of symptoms. Reporter checked online and they said it was a normal thing. Patient came down and showed reporter the bruises. Patient wasn&#39;t really paying attention to them. Patient had one or two bruises when she noticed and at the time of the report she was getting more. They had worsened. Patient took ibuprofen (ADVIL) for fever and she felt better. Outcome of events blood clots and she did get really sick, she was displaying a lot of symptoms was unknown, of event bruises on the legs, she was getting more, she would say they have worsened was not resolved, and of other events was resolved.

Also at end of May she began to experience chest pain when working out.  On June 14th she felt chest pain just walking and developed a cough.  I took her to ER on June 15th around 1am.  Her chest X-ray showed some abnormality.  Around 3am she had significant difficulty breathing.  She was admitted and a cardiologist and pulmonary physicians determined she was in heart failure with an ejection fraction of 10%.  She was life flighted to another hospital where she spent 3 weeks on Echmo and Impella, received a heart transplant on week 4 and is still in ICU recovering.  We are not sure if the vaccine is related to her illness.  We just know that patient was a healthy 19 year old, former high school athlete, current straight A student having completed her freshman year of college, and no health issues prior to this event.

This contactable Nurse reported for a 19-year-old female patient that:   A 19-year-old female  patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for Injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 22Jan2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9262) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing penicillin allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There were no other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient experienced bleeding vaginally four days after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine on 26Jan2021. Nexplanon removal &amp; IUD insertion treatment was received for event bleeding vaginally four days after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and also since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal association between the event &#34;Vaginal haemorrhage&#34; and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient is not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination, No known allergies. She took the vaccine around 10:00am and around 6:00pm (also reported as 06:30 PM) she noticed that her left foot had swollen. She consulted with her general physician and he requested that patient did an Ultra Sound exam of her left leg. The result of the exam reported a small clot behind her left knee. Therefore, doctor suggested that she reported these events to Pfizer so an evaluation is made to identify if similar events have occurred with other patients. She was concerned if she should take the second shot on 17Apr2021. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient received Eliquis 5mg (two times daily) as treatment. Patient had Nasal Swab on 01Apr2021 and tested negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Had some crazy nosebleeds beginning 4 days after my first dose. I ended up pulling a gigantic blood clot out of my nose during the first one. It was terrifying. I?ve had 6 nosebleeds since my first dose and I?ve never had issues with nosebleeds before. They last a long time too and each one comes with a clot. I also have bruises all over my legs and that have appeared randomly and if I get cut I take forever to stop bleeding.

                                                After about a week or less following each shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, my menstrual cycle began to experience SEVERE irregularities. As someone who has been on the same birth control for many many years (brand/type is NORG-EE oral contraceptives), with no previous issues and an extremely regulated cycle, the effects I experienced were far from normal. My periods came a week early, and lasted for the entirety of the rest of the cycle (totaling 2 weeks of bleeding). The bleeding was extremely heavy containing intense and large clotting for the entirety of the period. Aside from losing a tremendous amount of blood, I have experienced heavy cramping in the lower abdomen and lower/mid back regions both during these periods and even sometimes when I am not bleeding at all. These side effects coupled have caused me to feel fatigued to the point of feeling like I needed to pass out, and due to this I adopted to taking iron supplements daily during the irregular bleeding (chelated iron, 18 mg capsules as recommended). As a result of this concerning symptom, I scheduled a visit to see my primary OBGYN, and was told that this is a common issue that they have been seeing following patient vaccinations. It is my hope that my periods will be regular this month, but for now I am unsure that this issue has resolved.

A 21-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number= EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 05Jan2021 10:00 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced rash on lower legs similar to that seen with thrombocytopenia on 09Jan2021 at time of 12:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect drug on reported thrombocytopenia cannot be excluded.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer covid-19 vaccine, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EN6205, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route in the right arm on 07Apr2021 (age at vaccination: 22-year-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included extreme immune system and seizures that only lasted about 2 years when she was a baby. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had issues when she was born, she was 3 weeks post term, she was adopted and when all the kids would get sick, she would always get the sickest. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On an unknown date, few days later she felt something and thought it was anxiety, 2 weeks after vaccination from 15May2021, she woke herself up threw up and saying that her heart was racing around 8:30 in the morning, so she went and got their finger monitor, and her heart rate was out of control, so they took her to the emergency room. They tried to get her heart rate down with medications and sent us to an electro physicist, and the rest is history. Patient has been an athlete her whole life, has been in great shape with no heart problems. She was taken to the ER and they captured flutter on the EKG and AFIB issues. Later she was hospitalized and ended up having cardiac surgery about a week ago at 13:00 (16Jun2021 to 17Jun2021). Caller states that her daughter was doing really well, they had to do an ablation. Caller states they saw the cardiologist today, her daughter may have bouts of palpitations, but has had nothing since 3 days after the surgery. Caller wanted to know if AFIB has been reported as a reaction. She received her second shot of BNT162B2 (Pfizer covid-19 vaccine, Solution for Injection, Lot Number: EN6199) in the right arm on 28Apr2021. They said she will recover completely, but it will take about 3 months. She will have to be followed by a cardiologist. The patient underwent lab test and procedure on 15May2021 which included flutter on the EKG. The clinical outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm, on 04May2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269), as dose 1, single, at age 22 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, at a pharmacy/drug store. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Raynaud&#39;s disease, all from unknown dates, not reported if ongoing or not. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient received unspecified medications within 2 weeks of vaccination (unspecified concomitant medications). On 07May2021 (also reported as &#34;around day 3 or day 4&#34;), the patient started to get dizzy. On the same day, 07May2021, the patient felt like have a stroke because she could not make thoughts. She had pitting in left leg (also reported as &#34;pitting in left left&#34;, pending clarification), which was pale and had veins showing, and she was struggling to breathe and was weak. On 09May2021 (also reported as &#34;about day 5&#34;), her heart rate was very low and she noticed circulation issues. On 11May2021 (also reported as &#34;day 7&#34;), her legs swelled up so bad. On 14May2021 (also reported as &#34;day 10&#34;), the patient&#39;s thyroid or throat area was pounding. The events resulted to emergency room and physician&#39;s office visits. Treatment for the events included turmeric and aspirin which the patient took every day, multiple times a day. Blood work on an unspecified date mostly came back normal. The patient reported the events were better in two weeks. Her physician advised her to skip the second dose. However, the patient received the second dose out of &#34;fear of missing out&#34; on 25May2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178) in the left arm. The patient was recovering from the events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                AFIB/flutter; threw up; Threw up and saying that her heart was racing/have bouts of palpitations/heart rate was out of control; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 22-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right at age of 22 years on 28Apr2021 (lot number: EN6199) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included extreme immune system, described that patient was 3 weeks post term (as reported) and had issues when she was born, she was adopted and when all the kids would get sick she would always get the sickest; had seizures that only lasted about 2 years (not ongoing) when she was a baby. Family medical history relevant to AE was none. Concomitant medications were none. No vaccines administered on same date or within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient previous took bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right at age of 22 years on 07Apr2021 (Lot no: : EN6205) for covid-19 immunisation, few days later she felt something and thought it was anxiety. On 15May2021, 8:30 in the morning patient threw up and was saying that her heart was racing, so she got their finger monitor, and heart rate was out of control so they took her to the emergency room. They tried to get her heart rate down with medications and sent her to an electro physicist, and the rest was history. The only reason attributed this to the vaccine was because this occurred 17 days after her second shot and patient was has been an athlete her whole life, has been in great shape with no heart problems. They captured flutter on the EKG, and saw AFIB when she was under, on 15May2021. Patient ended up having to have cardiac surgery (for AFIB) on 16Jun2021 13:00 in hospital from 16Jun2021 to 17Jun2021. Patient was doing really well, they had to do an ablation. Patient will recover completely, but it will take about 3 months. She will have to be followed by a cardiologist. Saw the cardiologist, patient may have bouts of palpitations, but has had nothing since 3 days after the surgery (19Jun2021). The outcome of the events palpitations was recovered on 19Jun2021, other events was recovering.  Follow-up actions are needed. Further information has been requested.

Before the needle was out, I knew something was wrong but almost didn?t believe how fast it happened. My throat started itching and swelling shut. I was in full blown anaphylactic shock in less than 2 minutes. I got an EpiPen shot in the parking lot and was admitted into the hospital where I continued having various reactions. A week after the shot, I?m still breaking out in hives uncontrollably.

When I arrived patient was laying down on a chair with a friend, shaking with seizure like activity but alert and oriented to person place and time. Upon my arrival she was shaking, vomited x 1 and then complained about chest pain.   Vitals upon my arrival: HR 58, o2 100% RR appeared to be around 22-24 (hyperventilating) BP 88 systolic (manual)--repeated by medics upon arrival minutes later 110/72.   Given throat closing sensation, vomiting, shortness of breath I advised to call 911 and ordered Epinephrine x 1 which was given by RN immediately. Pt was then placed on the grown chin up, she continued to shake throughout entire body but continued to be alert and oriented. Medics then arrived on seen, started an IV, glucose by medics 84, IVF started by medics. Pt was transported to ER via medics.   Pt is not a patient, last visit 2017. Pt did state she has hx of POTS and DRESS syndrome to Lamictal. Reports taking cetirizine this AM, Zofran and Oxycodone and Baclofen (prescribed by external PCP?).   Prior to transport to ER pt continued to be alert oriented, but shaking and twitching throughout her body. MD verbally communicated to patient to not receive the 2nd dose given her severe anaphylaxis like reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Pt can be referred to allergist after ER follow up by PCP.  Denied pregnancy.

                                                Hospital course: 23 yo female with no significant PMH presenting to the ED with right sided CP, worse with deep inspiration.  Received 2nd covid vaccination last week- mild reaction with fever thereafter.  She had w/u in the ED including an EKG with inferior and septal TWI and trop of 1.61.  CTA chest was negative.  She was admitted.  After admit, troponin trended up (1.61--3.71--4.93).  CRP 49.1, ESR 21.   Echo showed apex hypokinesis so with TWI on EKG and elevated trop, cardiology elected for LHC.  This was normal.  Cardiac MRI showed myopericarditis. She was started on high dose ASA, colchicine and bblocker for this.  Likely viral etiology (Covid, Resp 4 plex negative).  Trop trended down on 4/13 (CRP still rising).  Cardiology was ok with discharge.  Will need 2 weeks of ASA and 3 months of colchicine.  No strenuous activities for that time frame.  She is getting her Masters in music/violin and did not need a return to school note.   Feeling somewhat better at discharge- rated pain 6/10.    Internal Medicine followup in 1 week Cardiology followup in 2 months

I haven?t passed period blood clots this large since I was 12 years old so I wanted to report it since I happened to get these unusual blood clots the cycle after I got the first dose. I am getting the second dose on 5/5 so I will see if the same results take place. I have reported this to my gynecologist but am waiting on her response.

I have been experiencing heavier bleeding and more clotting than average. My cramps are also worse. This never happens to me, and it only makes sense due to the vaccine. I would like there to be some organization that looks into this because I have not changed anything in my life for this to be happening.

Symptoms in leg started a few days prior to admittance. Was put on Heparin via shot and then IV. Clotting grew worse overnight with leg swelling, leading to an inability to walk. After increased elevation leg improved and was put on an oral dose of Eliquis. Was put on oxygen in the ICU and took portable oxygen home when discharged on 5/17.   Also tested positive for strep 4/11.  Was advised to file a report by my PCP.

                                                4/30 - Five minutes after the vaccine, I passed out. I felt uncontrollably shaky and my vision went white. I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

Called 911 transported to ER. Monitored cardiac unit for 24 hours, HA. Two months of HAs. I went home and I don&#39;t recall exact how everything transpired.  I do remember they wanted follow up with PCP.  I developed blood clots in R arm, platelets were high since getting vaccinated.  *originally diagnosed with colitis but now diagnosed with Chrohns disease.  1/16 I did have a personal injury in a parking lot that exacerbated the issues, I was vaccinated after.  *In transition with new doctors now and have not really discussed the potential of this being caused by vaccine, focused more on pain management.  **before this vaccine, I was relatively healthy before, no issues.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care.

                                                I have only gotten the first shot so far. I got the shot last Sunday and then on the following Tuesday I went to donate plasma. I frequently donate plasma. I had no side effects from the shot up until that point. Immediately after donating, I got in my car and looked down to see that my needle injection site from donating was pouring out an excessive amount of blood. I lost all vision and the employees helped to rebandage the site and put pressure. That had never happened before after donating. It seemed that my blood failed to clot.

A 24-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 (Lot Number: EW0167) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included weird blood pressure (kind of have weird blood pressure, it goes up and down pretty frequently, no treatment), endometriosis, seizure. Concomitant medications included lamotrigine (LAMOTRIGINE) taken for seizure; quetiapine. The patient had an adverse reaction to the first of the two vaccine shot and wanted to know if she can get the second. She had pretty bad cold and flu symptoms and did have anaphylactic allergies, and swell up like her throat, neck and face swelled a little bit on 06May2021. It wasn&#39;t enough to go to the emergency room. She took Benadryl and kind of monitored but she thought her doctor would have called it like a pre-anaphylactic sort of reaction. The patient was having the reactions on yesterday (06May2021), still didn&#39;t feel good today (07May2021). She started to swell up she took Benadryl and Tylenol because she had slight fever it was 102 (06May2021). So, Tylenol 400 mg (took 2 pills), took 600 mg of Ibuprofen and the Benadryl 200 (200 but not entirely sure). She tried not to take medication unless have to, the moment she started throwing up she took the Benadryl only took that once, her arm was really killing her so she did take the Ibuprofen twice yesterday (06May2021) and twice Wednesday (05May2021). The fever came back yesterday (06May2021). Tylenol, probably the same twice on Wednesday, twice on Thursday, the patient hadn&#39;t had to take any today (07May2021). The outcome of events was not recovered.

A 24-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 11May2021 at 14:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was taking unspecified birth control medication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was on her second week of completing the vaccine. The patient reported that on Thursday night, 20May2021, she was just laying down on her couch watching Netflix with her laptop on her lap, her leg fell asleep but she didn&#39;t think anything of it because once she started walking around it went back fine. However, on 21May2021, Friday morning, she was having serious pain in her left thigh. She believed it was a muscle strain. The patient did a cold compress, warm bath and took Tylenol from Friday to Saturday. She thought it got better but by 23May2021, Sunday night, she was incapable of walking on her own and needed assistance just to go to the bathroom. On 24May2021, she went to Urgent Care and they stated that she may have a blood clot so she went to the ER (Emergency Room). While at the ER they said she had a massive blood clot from her thigh to her ankle. She would need a procedure done to remove it and was later admitted into the hospital and scheduled for the procedure. Blood thinners and suctioning out the blood clot was done as treatment. The patient been tested for COVID-19 (nasal swab) on 24May2021 with a result of negative. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

There is also a lump in that area.

The consistency of the blood was much thinner than what I generally experience during my period. On the second day after, I am currently experiencing occasional pain in my genital area. This is embarrassing for me to write but I know others who have experienced similar side effects. For this reason, I feel the need to voice this side effect.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on an unspecified date (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination on unspecified date. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included unspecified birth control pills. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En9581) in the right arm on 09Feb2021 at 02:00 PM (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 21Mar2021 at 14:00 after her second vaccine the patient had an anaphylactic reaction. It was something she had eaten before so not new to her body. It happened again on 27Apr2021. Still from things she eats normally. Both occurrences happened 30 minutes after eating and came on quickly. The event resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event which included Benedryl, steroids, and given an epipen. The patient recovered from the event on unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, known drug safety profile and plausible temporal association, the causality between the suspect drug and the event cannot be excluded.

She went to the emergency department at Medical Center  and was diagnosed with ITP by a hematologist who recommended that she not receive the second covid vaccine given the risks outweigh the benefits with her new diagnosis/possible reaction to the vaccine.  She was treated with IVIG and prescribed corticosteroids and discharged.  Two weeks later she was visiting friends in another city and developed a severe headache.  She presented to our facility and was found to have a subdural hematoma on imaging and a platelet count of 9k cells/mm3.  She was aggressively treated for her ITP with high dose IVIG, romiplostim, and rituximab and has stabilized neurologically with the SDH stable - though her platelets have been treatment refractory despite transfusions and the aforementioned therapy.  Remains admitted at our facility.
