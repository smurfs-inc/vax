                                                Stroke; severe allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient&#39;s father) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the Right Arm (also reported as: right shoulder) on 23Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) at 16-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included heart valve operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Mechanical heart valves).  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, which was reported as: &#34;Yes she is taking other medication.&#34; On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced stroke and severe allergic reaction (medically significant). The clinical course was reported as follows: On behalf of his 16-year-old daughter, the patient&#39;s father reported that she had the first dose administer in the right shoulder on 23Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient had a stroke.  The patient&#39;s father stated, &#34;our lives have changed, completely.&#34; The patient&#39;s father reported that his daughter was receiving medical care ever since then; and was also being treated by a physician.  The patient&#39;s father was asking about compensation from Pfizer regarding his daughter&#39;s severe adverse event (AE) that occurred after the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s father reported that the case had been submitted by the (Name) healthcare team &#34;to the FDA and to Pfizer, and I haven&#39;t heard back from either.&#34; The patient&#39;s father mentioned in passing, that he &#34;could call (Name) and have this all over the news&#34; but that he &#34;wants to be responsible&#34; and doesn&#39;t want to do that.  The patient&#39;s father stated the concern, &#34;Well my concern I am not sure that medical profession is what I really need to do, my concern is that my daughter took the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 23Mar2021 in (Name) in vaccination location. On 29Mar2021, 6 days later, she had a stroke, and that she is receiving a medical care ever since then , now  my question is like I said probably for  maybe for correlated relation type of person define as well as  for it  there is a compensation for adverse reaction to COVID vaccination being that this was only thing that was introduce in her system as far as doing that time the vaccination shot.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: &#34;that&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34; on an unknown date; also reported: &#34;Yes that&#39;s been ongoing as far as giving blood. That&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34;. Therapeutic measures were not taken and was reported as &#34;no she isn&#39;t taking anything for it.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events, stroke and severe allergic reaction, was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021411875 Pfizer

Her course was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring ICU admission for CPAP), pancytopenia, diarrhea with buttock skin breakdown requiring rectal tube for wound and stool management, and extensive workup which was unrevealing for an infectious cause.  She clinically improved with respect to pancytopenia with discontinuation of felbamate, and completed a treatment course with Zosyn for suspected buttock SSTI.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Last time at the doctors office was for her well check in Oct or Nov. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine.  On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling. They are not sure if it (anaphylactic reaction) is related to the vaccine. She does not have any allergic issues of any kind and is not sure if it is from the vaccine. The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid. She was on steroids for like 4 days. The steroid was prednisone. Outcome of anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing, face swelling were recovered on 21Apr2021. Outcome of anaphylactic reaction was unknown.

A 16-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 25Apr2021 (Lot Number: EWO171) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema, Pyle disease, food allergies, short stature, seasonal allergies, peanuts allergies and nuts allergies. It was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. On 26Apr2021, the patient had elevated temperatures to 104 [unspecified unit], 4-5 days post vaccination (pending clarification) with associated chills and headaches. Thrombocytopenia noted. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment was provided for the adverse events. The patient was tested post vaccination with a nasal swab test on 28Apr2021 and the result of negative. The reporter did not consider the events was serious. The outcome of the event was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported event thrombocytopenia was observed only 1 day after vaccination.  It is unlikely that thrombocytopenia is related to BNT162B2.  It&#39;s more likely intercurrent medical condition.

She was tested for active COVID-29 infection via nasal swab PCR and tested positive. Upon presentation labs were drawn and her platelet count was found to be 8 on 5/15. Repeat labs were drawn that day to confirm low platelet count and confirmed diagnosis and thrombocytopenia secondary to an immune reaction to the vaccine was suspected. She was admitted and was started on tranexamic acid, medroxyprogesterone, dexamethasone and IV immunoglobulin (Ig) to help treat low platelet count and vaginal bleeding. As of writing, she is still admitted and her most recent platelet count on 5/17 was 16.

Family had given benadryl and zyrtec without improvement, and symptoms were worsening to presents for evaluation.     My exam (after Epipen) showed: Gen: nontoxic appearing; HEENT: no lip/tongue/uvular edema, PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB, no wheezing; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: hives over hands, arms, abdomen, and legs, including between fingers and on soles of feet     Patient presenting with allergic reaction after Covid vaccine, could be more benign allergic reaction such as urticaria multiforme, but given constellation of symptoms and history of severe allergic reaction in past, will treat as anaphylaxis. Therefore given Epipen, steroids, and will plan for observation.   Observed 4 hours and continued to be well appearing without symptoms of rebound anaphylaxis. Therefore, patient safe for discharge to home with supportive care and PCP follow up. Given Rx for benadryl and steroids, refilled Epipein. Family in agreement with plan and verbalize understanding of signs and symptoms to return to care.  Final Diagnosis  1. Anaphylaxis T80.52XA

A 16 years old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via intramuscular in arm right on 01May2021 10:00 AM (Lot Number: EW0175) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnancy at time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies (NKA). The patient&#39;s concomitant medication was reported as no prescribed medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Symptomatic COVID-19 (Non-PCR rapid NAA) from nasal swab on 19Dec2020 was negative. The patient admitted on 19May2021 with sepsis secondary to myocarditis and pneumonia, status post (s/p) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), after presenting with fever, myalgia, sore throat, hypotension, elevated troponin, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and leukocytosis with left shift. Sore throat has been present for about a week (onset estimated on 12May2021) and fevers began on 17May2021 with a T max of 103. On 18May2021, she began developing shortness of breath and upon evaluation by the primary care physician (PCP) on 19May2021, she was admitted. During initial workup on 19May2021 upon admission, hospitalist was high concerned as she developed hypotension of 91/48 on 20May2021 at 08:35 am. Computerized tomography (CT) of chest on 20May2021 showed patchy consolidation of the posterior lower lobes bilaterally. Upon transfer to another place, further serologies were collected which showed leukocytosis with left shift, highly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated troponin, elevated Interleukin-6 (IL-6), elevated ferritin, negative covid antibodies (abs) test, negative respiratory viral panel  (RVP), and negative COVID PCR. Coronavirus NAA from nasal swab on 18May2021 was negative. Respiratory Viral Panel from nasal swab on 19May2021 was negative. COVID-19 (Standard NAA) from nasal swab on 19May2021 was negative. SARS CoV2 Antibodies from blood test on 20May2021 was negative. SARS COV2 IgM Antibodies from blood test on 20May2021 was positive. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2grams/kg started on 20May2021 at 22:57. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, there is a reasonable possibility that events sepsis, myocarditis, pneumonia were related to suspect drug based on the temporal relation between the vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 17-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Colitis ulcerative from 2014 and ongoing, Genetic immune deficiency, additional Information for other conditions: Caller describes it as &#34;22q&#34;. patient was born with this but wasn&#39;t actually diagnosed until patient was 11 years old. They checked with patient&#39;s Immunologist before getting the vaccine especially with her daughter&#39;s history. Thyroid disease from 2015 to an unknown date, additional Information for other conditions: patient didn&#39;t have a thyroid- her thyroid was removed. Concomitant medications included cetirizine; famotidine; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR); and epinephrine (EPIPEN) all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; aloe vera, pramocaine hydrochloride (ATARAX ANTI ITCH LOTION) taken for itching, swelling and hives, start and stop date were not reported. The patient took first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12Mar2021 10:00 (Lot: EN6207) for COVID-19 immunization and patient had no side effects after the first dose. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient just saw her Immunologist and her Immunologist instructed her to report what is going on with patient. Caller clarifies patient&#39;s immunologist plans to call and report as well but also instructed her to call and report the side effects her daughter is experiencing. Her daughter was cleared to have the COVID vaccine. The caller explains they always check with her immunologist because of her daughter&#39;s immune issues. Her daughter received the second dose of the COVID vaccine on 02Apr2021. On the evening of 04Apr2021, her daughter broke out in hives. They didn&#39;t think it was a big deal, they thought it was just an allergic reaction. She tried Benadryl and several other things. They went and saw her daughters regular general practitioner and the doctor believed it was just a delayed skin reaction, which seems to be common with the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The doctor told her he&#39;s seen one other person with this delayed reaction. He gave her daughter a steroid injection, a Steroid Dose Pack and Pepcid. She was also placed on Benadryl as needed. About 2 weeks after this, her daughter and lip and face swelling and ended up in the Emergency Room (ER). At this ER visit, they initiated the allergic reaction protocol and it was not an anaphylactic reaction at that point. Her daughter received IV Benadryl and IV steroids, the caller is not sure what else. She confirms she has no NDC, Lot number and expiry dates for the medication her daughter received in the ER. The ER doctor contacted the Immunologist on call and the Immunologist had seen a few cases with a delayed reaction. Caller clarifies the ER doctor discussed her daughter&#39;s delayed skin reaction with the on-call Immunologist. The oncologist put her daughter on generic Zyrtec, 20mg in the morning and 20mg at night. The following week, her daughter woke her up with facial and tongue swelling. She clarifies further her daughter had fever, joint pain, and had broken out in a rash that moved to her face and lips. She immediately took her to the ER. The ER followed the whole anaphylaxis protocol and was given an EpiPen. She explains her daughter was diagnosed serum/covid sickness. This has been going on for over 6 weeks. The reaction will come and go. She was told as her daughter&#39;s body develops immunity, she is basically allergic to it. She clarifies at her ER visits, they checked her daughters liver and kidneys. It was noted her daughter had and elevated CRP, which is an inflammatory marker. The caller was told they thought her daughter had serum sickness from the vaccine which may last 4-6 weeks or it may be prolonged, so they just went with it. They told her as long as it didn&#39;t move to her lips or affect her daughters breathings, eventually it would wax and wane and go away. Her daughter started breaking out on her arms and legs and last Saturday, she woke up and her face was swelling. She clarifies her daughter&#39;s eye started to swell and her tongue. She took her straight to the ER and the ER followed the anaphylaxis protocol and injected her with an EpiPen. They contacted her Immunologist to check and make sure it wasn&#39;t anything else and consulted with the Covid Vaccine Clinic and it was found 3 other patients had this happen. No further details were provided regarding the 3 other patients. Right now, her daughter is on 4 different medications and an EpiPen. They contacted her insurance about her being placed on a biologic because not even the current medications her daughter is on is making everything going away. Caller verifies her daughter was never admitted into the hospital. When she was last seen in the ER Monday, she her daughter was monitored for 4 hours after the EpiPen was administered. The events require a visit to Emergency Room (total of three ER visits) and Physician Office. She known the last/third ER visit was Monday, 17May2021. The second ER visit was 04May2021. She believes the initial/first ER visit was probably a week or so before the second one. She clarifies she broke out in hives on 04 Apr2021 and went to the doctor on 07Apr2021 or 08Apr2021 so the ER visit was around the next week. Since her daughter had such a good response from the EpiPen the ER doctor took pictures before and after. She clarifies the name of the biologic they want to put her daughter on is Xolair, it is a monthly injection. She explains the current cocktail they have her daughter on is not working. She provides the following product information for these 4 medications and EpiPen. Relevant Tests included she knows they are testing for any other thing that it could be to rule it out. She knows they ran a CIS-tray, a complete CIQ , a Histamine release something and Tryptase. She knows they checked her CRP (inflammatory marker) because it was elevated. Every time her daughter went to the ER, they did a CBC and all of that was normal except for the CRP inflammatory marker, however her CRP was normal at the last ER visit. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies.

The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient is not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination, No known allergies. She took the vaccine around 10:00am and around 6:00pm (also reported as 06:30 PM) she noticed that her left foot had swollen. She consulted with her general physician and he requested that patient did an Ultra Sound exam of her left leg. The result of the exam reported a small clot behind her left knee. Therefore, doctor suggested that she reported these events to Pfizer so an evaluation is made to identify if similar events have occurred with other patients. She was concerned if she should take the second shot on 17Apr2021. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient received Eliquis 5mg (two times daily) as treatment. Patient had Nasal Swab on 01Apr2021 and tested negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 21-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 29Mar2021 15:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included birth control. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included medroxyprogesterone acetate (DEPO-PROVERA shot) taken for birth control. Within an hour of receiving, patient started bleeding, period symptoms at 04:00 PM on 29Mar2021, and it has progressed much worse. This makes patient question the integrity of her birth control, a depo shot once every 3 months. Patient visited doctor or other healthcare professional office for the event. No treatment received. It was unknown if patient had covid prior vaccination. No other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not test covid post vaccination. Outcome of the event was recovering.    Information on the Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On April 5th, 2021 I went to the E.D. , for shortness of breath and severe right shoulder pain. While there they got a chest x-ray, ran labs, and did a chest CT. The CT revealed that I had one blood clot in my left lung and two blood clots in my right lung, as well as slight pleural effusion in the right lower lobe. They put me on Xarelto for the next 3-6 months and monthly follow up visits with my primary care provider. I was also given Hydrocodone as need. I experienced extreme pain with breathing and sort of movement for a week and half but currently only have occasional shoulder and back pain usually at the end of the day.

Before the needle was out, I knew something was wrong but almost didn?t believe how fast it happened. My throat started itching and swelling shut. I was in full blown anaphylactic shock in less than 2 minutes. I got an EpiPen shot in the parking lot and was admitted into the hospital where I continued having various reactions. A week after the shot, I?m still breaking out in hives uncontrollably.

                                                23 yo FM who received first dose of Pfizer vaccine and then was noted to have shortness of breath and complaining tongue closing sensation immediately after at Vaccine Clinic --I was called to evaluate the patient. When I arrived patient was laying down on a chair with a friend, shaking with seizure like activity but alert and oriented to person place and time. Upon my arrival she was shaking, vomited x 1 and then complained about chest pain.   Vitals upon my arrival: HR 58, o2 100% RR appeared to be around 22-24 (hyperventilating) BP 88 systolic (manual)--repeated by medics upon arrival minutes later 110/72.   Given throat closing sensation, vomiting, shortness of breath I advised to call 911 and ordered Epinephrine x 1 which was given by RN immediately. Pt was then placed on the grown chin up, she continued to shake throughout entire body but continued to be alert and oriented. Medics then arrived on seen, started an IV, glucose by medics 84, IVF started by medics. Pt was transported to ER via medics.   Pt is not a patient, last visit 2017. Pt did state she has hx of POTS and DRESS syndrome to Lamictal. Reports taking cetirizine this AM, Zofran and Oxycodone and Baclofen (prescribed by external PCP?).   Prior to transport to ER pt continued to be alert oriented, but shaking and twitching throughout her body. MD verbally communicated to patient to not receive the 2nd dose given her severe anaphylaxis like reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Pt can be referred to allergist after ER follow up by PCP.  Denied pregnancy.

                                                I noticed a petechia rash on my legs the day after I received the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, April 06, 2021, I noticed the rash spreading around my chest area, neck area, thighs, and arms as the following days progressed. On Friday, April 09, 2021, I made an appointment at the Student Health Center where I was seen by clinician,  who requested I get blood labs done. After results showed that my platelet count was 30,000, she immediately referred me to the ER at Hospital. She informed that it was an adverse side effect to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she also informed me that it was a very rare instance and there are cases of other individuals that this has also happened to. Dr. informed me my situation was extremely dangerous and could have potentially been fatal if I had not decided to seek medical attention. I was admitted into the  Hospital on April 09, and was discharged on Monday, April 12, 2021. While I was in the hospital, that Friday 04/09 I received a blood transfusion for my low platelet count, it did not show much improvement, I was diagnosed with ITP by clinician  who is a clinician within the Hematology and Oncology department.  Dr. also informed me that this seemed to be an adverse side effect to the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Dr.then recommended I receive steroids for 4 consecutive days to increase my platelet count. The date of my discharge 04/12, my platelet count was 20,000 which is still considered extremely low but due to steroids that were given to me for 4 days, Dr.agreed that this would hopefully increase my platelet count.

                                                4/30 - Five minutes after the vaccine, I passed out. I felt uncontrollably shaky and my vision went white. I was not anxious prior to getting the vaccine and felt terror afterwards. 5/1 - I developed severe depression and suicidal ideation. I reported to those around me that I did not feel safe. I am not diagnosed with depression and did not experience depression prior to the vaccine. I felt suicidal, completely hopeless, anxious, and was uncontrollably bursting into tears without an identifiable trigger. 5/2 - I developed shooting pain in my legs and arms. It felt like a pulsating, stabbing pain that throbbed. It was unlike any pain I had experienced ever before. 5/3 - I developed a metallic taste in my mouth that could not be washed away with water or food. It was extremely noticeable. 5/4  - My period came a week early. I have been on birth control for seven years and have never experienced any changes in my menstrual cycle. I made no other lifestyle or health changes other than the vaccine. The period was extremely heavy, full of clots, and was painful. It lasted longer than usual, until about 5/9. 5/16 - I developed another period only a week after the first period. This period was equally as heavy and long-lasting. It remained until about 5/21.  Following the vaccine, I began suffering from heart palpitations, leg cramps, and random pains. I did not experience these prior to the vaccine. I cannot identify the date these symptoms began, but it was within the first week of taking the vaccine.

Called 911 transported to ER. Monitored cardiac unit for 24 hours, HA. Two months of HAs. I went home and I don&#39;t recall exact how everything transpired.  I do remember they wanted follow up with PCP.  I developed blood clots in R arm, platelets were high since getting vaccinated.  *originally diagnosed with colitis but now diagnosed with Chrohns disease.  1/16 I did have a personal injury in a parking lot that exacerbated the issues, I was vaccinated after.  *In transition with new doctors now and have not really discussed the potential of this being caused by vaccine, focused more on pain management.  **before this vaccine, I was relatively healthy before, no issues.

                                                About three days after vaccine, I started bleeding and getting blood clots. I went to ER to make sure I wasn&#39;t miscarrying. I wasn&#39;t that day. Everything looked okay. Baby was measuring much smaller than it should be. I kept bleeding lightly for a couple of days. Tuesday I was bleeding heavily - I went to ER again. Hormone levels - were going up but not as they should be. From Tuesday - Friday, I didn&#39;t bleed. I started bleeding on Saturday again. And I&#39;m still bleeding. I called my OB today and she is going to call me back in the morning to let me know what to do. I was last seen on Friday at ER again.   Pregnancy History - One other pregnancy - carried twins fine. Estimated date of delivery for this pregnancy - January 17, 2022.

                                                Anaphylaxis.   The COVID shot was given, no reaction then. After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I was lightheaded, nauseated and my tongue began to get itchy and swollen like the beginning of an anaphylactic reaction. I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                I have only gotten the first shot so far. I got the shot last Sunday and then on the following Tuesday I went to donate plasma. I frequently donate plasma. I had no side effects from the shot up until that point. Immediately after donating, I got in my car and looked down to see that my needle injection site from donating was pouring out an excessive amount of blood. I lost all vision and the employees helped to rebandage the site and put pressure. That had never happened before after donating. It seemed that my blood failed to clot.

A 24-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 (Lot Number: EW0167) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included weird blood pressure (kind of have weird blood pressure, it goes up and down pretty frequently, no treatment), endometriosis, seizure. Concomitant medications included lamotrigine (LAMOTRIGINE) taken for seizure; quetiapine. The patient had an adverse reaction to the first of the two vaccine shot and wanted to know if she can get the second. She had pretty bad cold and flu symptoms and did have anaphylactic allergies, and swell up like her throat, neck and face swelled a little bit on 06May2021. It wasn&#39;t enough to go to the emergency room. She took Benadryl and kind of monitored but she thought her doctor would have called it like a pre-anaphylactic sort of reaction. The patient was having the reactions on yesterday (06May2021), still didn&#39;t feel good today (07May2021). She started to swell up she took Benadryl and Tylenol because she had slight fever it was 102 (06May2021). So, Tylenol 400 mg (took 2 pills), took 600 mg of Ibuprofen and the Benadryl 200 (200 but not entirely sure). She tried not to take medication unless have to, the moment she started throwing up she took the Benadryl only took that once, her arm was really killing her so she did take the Ibuprofen twice yesterday (06May2021) and twice Wednesday (05May2021). The fever came back yesterday (06May2021). Tylenol, probably the same twice on Wednesday, twice on Thursday, the patient hadn&#39;t had to take any today (07May2021). The outcome of events was not recovered.

The consistency of the blood was much thinner than what I generally experience during my period. On the second day after, I am currently experiencing occasional pain in my genital area. This is embarrassing for me to write but I know others who have experienced similar side effects. For this reason, I feel the need to voice this side effect.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En6203), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on an unspecified date (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included COVID prior vaccination on unspecified date. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included unspecified birth control pills. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: En9581) in the right arm on 09Feb2021 at 02:00 PM (at the age of 25-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 21Mar2021 at 14:00 after her second vaccine the patient had an anaphylactic reaction. It was something she had eaten before so not new to her body. It happened again on 27Apr2021. Still from things she eats normally. Both occurrences happened 30 minutes after eating and came on quickly. The event resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event which included Benedryl, steroids, and given an epipen. The patient recovered from the event on unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, known drug safety profile and plausible temporal association, the causality between the suspect drug and the event cannot be excluded.

She went to the emergency department at Medical Center  and was diagnosed with ITP by a hematologist who recommended that she not receive the second covid vaccine given the risks outweigh the benefits with her new diagnosis/possible reaction to the vaccine.  She was treated with IVIG and prescribed corticosteroids and discharged.  Two weeks later she was visiting friends in another city and developed a severe headache.  She presented to our facility and was found to have a subdural hematoma on imaging and a platelet count of 9k cells/mm3.  She was aggressively treated for her ITP with high dose IVIG, romiplostim, and rituximab and has stabilized neurologically with the SDH stable - though her platelets have been treatment refractory despite transfusions and the aforementioned therapy.  Remains admitted at our facility.
