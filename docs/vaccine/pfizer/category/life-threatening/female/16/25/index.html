                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

                                                Anaphylaxis.   The COVID shot was given, no reaction then. After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 at 09:30 at a single dose in the workplace clinic for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and history of vasovagal syncope following vaccinations; this adverse reaction to the vaccination directly aligns with other episodes that have occurred to her following vaccinations/interactions with needles (ie. blood draws). The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levonorgestrel (MIRENA). On 25Jan2021 at 09:30 (after getting the vaccine), the patient felt herself losing consciousness, her vision went blurry first and she was able to brace herself by lying down against a wall, and low blood pressure following event (50/20). Blood pressure and pulse rose over the next 25 minutes. 15 minutes more of observation was completed. The patient did not receive treatments for the events. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 25-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Dec2020 12:30 in right arm at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had COVID prior vaccination.  Concomitant medication in two weeks included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient experienced vomited 40&#43; times, syncopal episodes, blood pressure dropped to 70/40, elevated bilirubin, elevated liver enzymes (ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase)) on 28Dec2020 19:30. Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. IV fluids were received for events. The patient was not tested COVID post vaccination. Outcome of elevated bilirubin was recovered on an unspecified date, and outcome of other events were recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported syncope cannot be excluded.
