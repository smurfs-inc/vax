                                                Stroke; severe allergic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient&#39;s father) from the Pfizer-sponsored program. A 16-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the Right Arm (also reported as: right shoulder) on 23Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) at 16-years-old as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included heart valve operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Mechanical heart valves).  Concomitant medications included an unspecified medication, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, which was reported as: &#34;Yes she is taking other medication.&#34; On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced stroke and severe allergic reaction (medically significant). The clinical course was reported as follows: On behalf of his 16-year-old daughter, the patient&#39;s father reported that she had the first dose administer in the right shoulder on 23Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, the patient had a stroke.  The patient&#39;s father stated, &#34;our lives have changed, completely.&#34; The patient&#39;s father reported that his daughter was receiving medical care ever since then; and was also being treated by a physician.  The patient&#39;s father was asking about compensation from Pfizer regarding his daughter&#39;s severe adverse event (AE) that occurred after the first dose of vaccine. The patient&#39;s father reported that the case had been submitted by the (Name) healthcare team &#34;to the FDA and to Pfizer, and I haven&#39;t heard back from either.&#34; The patient&#39;s father mentioned in passing, that he &#34;could call (Name) and have this all over the news&#34; but that he &#34;wants to be responsible&#34; and doesn&#39;t want to do that.  The patient&#39;s father stated the concern, &#34;Well my concern I am not sure that medical profession is what I really need to do, my concern is that my daughter took the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 23Mar2021 in (Name) in vaccination location. On 29Mar2021, 6 days later, she had a stroke, and that she is receiving a medical care ever since then , now  my question is like I said probably for  maybe for correlated relation type of person define as well as  for it  there is a compensation for adverse reaction to COVID vaccination being that this was only thing that was introduce in her system as far as doing that time the vaccination shot.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: &#34;that&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34; on an unknown date; also reported: &#34;Yes that&#39;s been ongoing as far as giving blood. That&#39;s for 4/2 out of normal&#34;. Therapeutic measures were not taken and was reported as &#34;no she isn&#39;t taking anything for it.&#34; The clinical outcome of the events, stroke and severe allergic reaction, was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021411875 Pfizer

A 18-years-old female non-pregnant patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in right arm on 24Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included dysmenorrhoea, menometrorrhagia, obesity, guillain-barre syndrome. Concomitant medication&#39;s included ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (LUTERA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took fluconazole (known allergies). Patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid test post vaccination on 25Mar2021 show the negative result. Patient claimed she became dizzy within 15 minutes of the vaccine and had a syncopal episode. She stated that it occurred twice since the vaccine. This MD conducted physical exam on 30Mar2021 and found bilateral cerumen impaction that was cleared. She reported that this revealed bilateral otitis media and she was diagnosed with acute sinus infection and treated. Although her symptoms can be explained by these findings, this MD was continuing work up for Guillain-Barre. The adverse event result in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event are supportive care, antibiotic for sinus infection and clearance of impacted cerumen. The outcome of the events were recovered with lasting effects.  No follow-up attempts are needed.

                                                bleeding; less soreness at the injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 18-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8735, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration administrated on left arm on 05Apr2021 at 16:00 at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other medications in two weeks. The patient did not have any known allergies. She received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Lot number: EN6204, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administrated on left arm on 14Mar2021 at 15:00 (03:00 PM) at the age of 18-year-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 05Apr2021 04:00 PM, reported that the 2nd dose of vaccine caused unusual amount of bleeding after needle was removed. The patient had to clean excess blood after the shot. The band aid was soaked with blood. The patient experienced less soreness at the injection site compared to the first vaccine shot. The concern is whether the vaccine was bled out due improper injection. She did not have any other vaccine in four weeks before the covid-19 vaccine dose. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. She was not having COVID prior to the vaccination, neither was tested for Covid-19 post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events on an unspecified date in 2021.

An 18-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EW0170), intramuscular, administered in the right arm on 20Apr2021 at 12:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. On 20Apr2021 at 12:45, the patient and her father moved into the waiting area with vehicle. According to the patient&#39;s dad, the patient began seizing in the car one minute after the vaccine administration. The dad called out to waiting area monitor. At 12:57 the patient was visibly having tonic clonic seizure and was administered with EpiPen in the right Leg. 911 was called. The patient stopped seizing and was awake and confused. She then became AOx4 (oriented to four spheres; time/place/person/situation). The patient visibly distressed and hyperventilating. At 12:59 the patient had tonic clonic movements and seizure again. The seizure lasted less than 15 seconds. The patient then became AOx4 again, distressed, and became nauseous. Heart rate (HR) was 56 and SpO2 was 98%.  At 13:00 the patient vomited while sitting up. The patient was still distressed and hyperventilating with respiratory rate (RR) of 30. The patient&#39;s post vomiting HR was 116 and SpO2 was 97%. The patient moved to a stretcher and moved to the shade. At 13:06 firefighters arrived and the patient had an HR of 114, BP of 141/46, SpO2 of 97%, RR 24 and AOx4. At 13:12 the ambulance arrived and the patient was taken to (Place). The events resulted in a visit to the Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on close temporal association, a reasonable possibility cannot be excluded that the suspect drug BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine)  contributed to the occurrence of the serious event Generalised tonic-clonic seizure.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time.

A 20-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number: ER2613) first dose on 20Mar2021 10:15 on left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient is not pregnant. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination, No known allergies. She took the vaccine around 10:00am and around 6:00pm (also reported as 06:30 PM) she noticed that her left foot had swollen. She consulted with her general physician and he requested that patient did an Ultra Sound exam of her left leg. The result of the exam reported a small clot behind her left knee. Therefore, doctor suggested that she reported these events to Pfizer so an evaluation is made to identify if similar events have occurred with other patients. She was concerned if she should take the second shot on 17Apr2021. AE resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Patient received Eliquis 5mg (two times daily) as treatment. Patient had Nasal Swab on 01Apr2021 and tested negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

However, I went to sleep and at 2 AM on 02/04/20, I started having fever, a severe HA, and myalgia that hindered my sleep. I took 500 mg Tylenol at 6 AM and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 8:30 AM, I went to use the restroom and felt dizzy with hot flashes. Immediately afterwards, I noticed that I had fainted and my mother helped me to my bed. After drinking soup and juice and having a bowel movement, I felt normal and alerted my PCP.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

Her mother is a physician and was present, providing care for her by fanning, comforting and helping her to lie down on the floor next to the waiting chairs. The patient did not faint. She did experience what appeared to be heavy breathing and light-headedness. We provided an ice pack from the immunization cart. The mother stated that the patient experiences this reaction every time she receives a vaccine due to her fear of needles. After about 30 minutes the patient was up and smiling. The family was thankful for our concern and help.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 17Apr2021 at 09:10 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included penicillin allergy from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing, asthma from an unspecified date (diagnosed at 4 years old and it is usually controlled with medications) and ongoing and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome from 2019 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any additional vaccines on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccination and did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccination. The patient previously received the flu shot on an unspecified date for immunization and experienced allergic to flu shot preservative and the patient previously received Biaxin on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced allergy. On 17Apr2021 at 09:12 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock; on 17Apr2021 the patient experienced throat feels tight, ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that comes and goes and then it will be on her chest , face, neck and shoulders and migrates wherever; on 18Apr2021 the patient experienced ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat; on 20Apr2021 the patient experienced dark purple on face; on 24Apr2021 the patient experienced some trouble breathing and chest pain; on 25Apr2021 the patient experienced a lot of bone pain; on 26Apr2021 the patient experienced white blood cell counts are all elevated and on unspecified dates the patient experienced face and neck swells, tachycardia, feels like she is having an asthma attack, blotch, blood counts continue to become worse and asthma worse. The reporter called to report that her daughter received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on 17Apr2021 and that her side effects started two minutes later (also reported as 4 minutes later). The patient experienced anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock. She stated that her daughter continued to have anaphylactic reactions and had to go to the hospital every day since then. The clinical course was reported as follows: her daughter and her husband went to get the vaccine together on 17Apr2021. They went to a facility giving the Pfizer vaccine, and the reporter stated that her daughter was asked, and she did tell them, that she could not receive the flu vaccine that had the additives in it because she was allergic to it. The reporter stated that her daughter was not taking the flu shot for years. She stated that her daughter was allergic to Biaxin but could take Zithromax because of the different additives. They had no idea what the preservative was, but it was obviously in the flu shot so they stopped getting the flu shot until they stopped putting the preservative in the vaccine. The reporter stated that her daughter received the COVID-19 vaccine and within two minutes her daughter told her dad that she was having a hard time breathing. Her daughter walked over to the city EMS who were on site and told them that she was having a hard time breathing. They treated her and then took her to hospital via ambulance. She was treated at the hospital and they were hesitant to discharge her because they were worried about her bounce back. This was exactly what has happened. Every night since the vaccine she has had to take her daughter into the hospital. Every day was a nightmare of either EpiPen injections, Tagamet, Benadryl or prednisone and ended up in the ER every day, where they give her IV Benadryl and send her home. The caller stated that her daughter&#39;s symptoms start with ginormous welts and then an itching to the back of the throat. She had seen a ginormous rash on her daughter&#39;s face that came and went and then it would be on her chest, face, neck and shoulders and migrated wherever. She saw dark purple on her daughter&#39;s face yesterday before she went to the ER. Her skin will blotch, and she will say that her throat feels tight like when she had a reaction to penicillin. She stated that her daughter used to get this when she they would give her penicillin; she would have that reaction every time she got penicillin and they finally said she was allergic to it. The caller states that after those symptoms started, she called EMS and they took her to a hospital. The caller stated she took her daughter to another hospital and they medicated her with IV Benadryl and fluids. Her primary care doctor told the emergency room staff to discharge the patient and that he would give her specific medications to go home with. He called in the medications, but they did not work. He gave her specific medication that did not work, half of her face was turning purple. The purple face was then replaced by an area approximately 1 inch wide on cheek between temple and the jaw. It was 1.5 inches long and was red and looked like a rash or welt. The patient would take an inhaler when she started to have breathing difficulties. That was when the reporter was like &#34;here she goes again&#34;. It felt like it almost made her asthma worse and had to treat that as well. There was a little oddity when they did blood work on her daughter and her white blood count was high and was probably her body reacting to the COVID-19 vaccine. So, she went back to the hospital. The nurses said there was nothing they could do for her, and she needed to find an allergist. The reporter stated that she was tired of the ER visits and wanted her daughter to get better. She stated that she doubled the dose of her daughter&#39;s Tagamet. She stated that the patient&#39;s face and neck swells and she would get tachycardia. The reporter stated that she would not take her daughter to the hospital anymore. The hospital did not think it could be related to the vaccine, but she had not done anything else. The reporter wanted to report this event because she did not think people were taking this seriously. She stated that no one believed it was related to the vaccine, so they were not getting help. She wanted to know if this was a side effect and what could she do about it. She also inquired on whether her daughter should get the second shot. She stated that her daughter would not get the second shot. She had heard that if you had any reaction to the vaccine, then you should not receive the second dose. Her daughter&#39;s doctors have told her to receive the second vaccine. The reporter also stated that she wondered if this was some mast cell activation due to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The reporter also asked if Pizer made a preservative free vaccine. Upon follow-up received on 27Apr2021, the patient called to report that she was still experiencing side effects from the anaphylactic reaction and it had been 10 days since administration. She was told it would last about 4-10 days and then be gone, but it had continued, and it had been over 10 days. She had no new symptoms, other than a lot of bone pain. The bone pain made it feel like her bones were shattering. She went to the ER yesterday where they did blood work and said that all of her white blood cell counts were elevated. The anaphylaxis lasted from 17Apr2021 and subsided in that sense on 24Apr2021.  Since then she still had the chest pain, some trouble breathing, and felt like she was having an asthma attack. She had been back and forth to the ER several times since 17Apr2021. The ER kept ruling her symptoms as a reaction to the vaccine. She had been using epinephrine as needed. The patient stated that she was not planning on receiving the second dose due to her reaction. She wanted to know where she should go from here. She wanted to know if this would last forever and how much longer could her symptoms last. The clinical outcomes of the events ginormous welts/rash or welt 1.5 inches by 1 inch on cheek, itching in back of throat and a lot of bone pain were not recovered/not resolved; dark purple on face was recovered/resolved on 21Apr2021; outcomes of all other events were unknown.

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

I fainted about 15 minutes after sitting down in the waiting area and upon fainting hit my head on the floor. I regained consciousness while laying on the floor getting my vitals taken by staff. Because of the minor head injury and proximity to getting the vaccine, I accepted being taken to the ER.

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, developed &#34;blackening&#34; vision and then lost consciousness. Uncertain about time of loss of consciousness. Other symptoms included pallor, fast heart rate, sweating, nausea and loss of bladder function. No treatment required, seen in the ED and recovered without treatment.   Because she was driving a car at the time, she rear-ended the car in front of her and the airbags deployed. Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

She was told to have a seat and wait 30 minutes to ensure patient safety.  Immunizer notified me/pharmacist of patient&#39;s history and staff was informed to watch her for any adverse events.  5-10 minutes later patient walked up to counsel window and notified pharmacist she was going to faint.  I asked her to please return to her seat and immediately a technician and I went out and assisted her to a chair.  We provided a bottle of water and advised her to sip some.  After a few more minutes she passed out in the chair.  At that point we called 911.  The operator advised us to lay her flat.  We moved her into the training room and waited for EMT to arrive.  They arrived a few minutes later.  At that point she was beginning to come around.  I left to return to pharmacy as she was being cared for.  20 minutes later the EMT consulted me and patient vitals were good and she was feeling much better and refused to be transported to hospital.  I signed off their form as a witness of her refusal.

                                                I noticed a petechia rash on my legs the day after I received the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, April 06, 2021, I noticed the rash spreading around my chest area, neck area, thighs, and arms as the following days progressed. On Friday, April 09, 2021, I made an appointment at the Student Health Center where I was seen by clinician,  who requested I get blood labs done. After results showed that my platelet count was 30,000, she immediately referred me to the ER at Hospital. She informed that it was an adverse side effect to my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, she also informed me that it was a very rare instance and there are cases of other individuals that this has also happened to. Dr. informed me my situation was extremely dangerous and could have potentially been fatal if I had not decided to seek medical attention. I was admitted into the  Hospital on April 09, and was discharged on Monday, April 12, 2021. While I was in the hospital, that Friday 04/09 I received a blood transfusion for my low platelet count, it did not show much improvement, I was diagnosed with ITP by clinician  who is a clinician within the Hematology and Oncology department.  Dr. also informed me that this seemed to be an adverse side effect to the first-dose of the Pfizer vaccine, Dr.then recommended I receive steroids for 4 consecutive days to increase my platelet count. The date of my discharge 04/12, my platelet count was 20,000 which is still considered extremely low but due to steroids that were given to me for 4 days, Dr.agreed that this would hopefully increase my platelet count.

A 23-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 21Apr2021 08:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) (at the age of 23 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen. The patient previously took septra and experienced allergies (known allergies); and first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 08:45 at right arm for COVID-19 immunization. No other vaccine in four weeks. On 22Apr2021, the patient had a fever of up to 103.5 and was down to around 102 by the time of the incident (around 4:00). The patient woke up and was standing for about 3 minutes to refill water when she got super nauseous. She was making her way to the bathroom to throw up, and the next thing she knew she was on the floor. The patient was not sure how long she was passed out for though she had no reason to believe it was long. She tried to sit up, but she really wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she laid back down and closed her eyes for a bit. Then she got super hot and sweaty. Once that passed (maybe a few more minutes), she was able to check her temperature and she was down to around 101 and was able to get back to bed. No treatment for the events. No COVID prior vaccination. The patient had not been COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered in Apr2021.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

A 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 25Jan2021 at 09:30 at a single dose in the workplace clinic for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and history of vasovagal syncope following vaccinations; this adverse reaction to the vaccination directly aligns with other episodes that have occurred to her following vaccinations/interactions with needles (ie. blood draws). The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levonorgestrel (MIRENA). On 25Jan2021 at 09:30 (after getting the vaccine), the patient felt herself losing consciousness, her vision went blurry first and she was able to brace herself by lying down against a wall, and low blood pressure following event (50/20). Blood pressure and pulse rose over the next 25 minutes. 15 minutes more of observation was completed. The patient did not receive treatments for the events. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient recovered from the events.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

She was not responsive and mildly shaking.  I gave her an Epipen shot and in less than a minute she was a wake and feeling much better.  She drank some water.  911 was not called because her mother was a nurse and was nearby.  She came and picked her up and took her to a doctor.  I checked on the patient this afternoon and she is feeling fine other than feeling tired.  She has a medical history of weight loss surgery and not dieting properly.  The administrator of the home  said she has a history of not feeling well and almost fainting from not eating properly after her weight loss surgery.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

I then called him back 4 minutes later and failed to form words, and also could not type words. I felt like I was going to faint and have no recollection of 10 minutes during that time. I had to leave work to go to the emergency room.  I had a massive headache for 3 days following my TIA.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.
