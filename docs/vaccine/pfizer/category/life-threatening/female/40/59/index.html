                                                Around at 7AM when I arrived at work I started feeling chills, took temperature 99.5F that is already elevated for me.  About 9:30 my temp was 101.8F and they sent me home.  I just had the chills and fever.  I got home and developed a headache and around 1PM I started feeling really dizzy. The temperature did not subside and the next day I woke up and I couldn&#39;t function, I felt really dizzy I kept laying down and drinking water, I could not keep anything down my stomach did not feel well. I felt like I had to vomit. When I sat down in the toilet then my ears started ringing pretty bad all of a sudden I could not hear anything and I passed out in the toilet. My husband found me and tried to wake me up. After that I still feel dizzy. I did not have any appetite either. I could barely hold water. The next day I was not as dizzy but my stomach was still upset but I could hold some soup down but then started with diarrhea. Employee health kept calling me everyday and I did the the telehealth appt and I also had a little bit of a rash in my chest that appeared all of a sudden red like a streak. The dizziness I had for the first 4 days, diarrhea did not come until the 3rd day and I had it for 2 days and my temperature was back to normal on the 4th day. Everything started to get better (my stomach stopped feeling queezy) around the 4th day but still felt fatigued until about 12/29/2020.

Took 50mg prednisone 2 benadryl and albuterol inhaler.  Breathing got better and hives went away but still had swollen throat and took pepcid. Headache afterwards but that&#39;s typical of an allergic reaction.  I can&#39;t be sure it was from the vaccine or not but nothing I did yesterday would normally trigger that reaction

I waited to see if it would go away and then a couple minutes later noticed my lips started itching and swelling and from there it just got worse.  I told the nurse practitioner that I think I was having a reaction, she had me take a seat told her my entire mouth throat &amp; lips felt swollen and itching and she looked and said it was full blown anaphylaxis reaction.  Administered EpiPen, benadryl and called ambulance where they took me to medial emergency department.

                                                Anaphylactic shock? Shortly after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore and I had a severe headache. Approximately 24-48 hours after I received the vaccine I started developing a red, hot, itchy raised rash on my ears and buttocks which became more prevalent and peaked around 80-90 hours later. Approximately 82 hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feeI nauseous, dizzy, and fatigued so I stood up to get ready for bed early. While brushing my teeth, I went pale white and felt like I was going to vomit. I put the toothbrush down and got on floor. My pulse felt like it had stopped. I tried to check my pulse and I could only detect one beat every other second. I called for my spouse and by the time he got to bathroom I was passed out. I came back to after about 30 seconds and was convulsing from chills. He put a blanket on me and grabbed my Apple Watch to try to get my pulse which read in the 50s (so I assume it was much lower when I passed out). My hands and feet were tingly and I stayed on the floor until my pulse got back up. I then had diarrhea. At this point in time the rash was most prevalent and was present mostly on my buttocks but also on my ears, scalp, pointer finger on right hand, thighs, and hips. I went to doctor the following morning an my vitals, blood sugar, EKG, urine screen were stable and indicated no issues. 106 hours later I still have the rash on all areas mentioned and am dizzy, nauseous, and fatigued.

A 41-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 07Jan2021, 15:00 (lot number: EL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in the hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history included Covid-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccines within four weeks. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient experienced sore throat, nausea, palpitations, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, faint, cough, body aches and myalgia on 08Jan2021, 19:00.

The patient received treatment including antibiotics (did not help); pain medications for myalgia. The patient was underwent COVID-19 (Nasal Swab) on 15Jan2021 which was negative, and PCR and Flu (nasal swab) test on 20Jan2021 which was negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events.

This has resolved. 12/29 at about 2:00 employee reports onset of tingling in the fingers of her right hand - index, middle, ring, and pinky. For about 2 hours the tingling was intense. As of 12/30 this has markedly improved and the tingling is intermittent. Later in the evening of 12/29 she noticed the onset of muscle pains throughout her body but especially in her feet. She also became very fatigued. These symptoms linger on 12/30. On 1/1 employee reports symptoms muscle soreness had resolved. 1/4 tingling in her fingers/arm has improved but is still present.

A 42-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and unknown if there is any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and unknown if the patient had been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On Jan2021, the patient experienced faint, shaking, febrile for around 36 hours, rigors, and light-headed. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovered on Jan2021. The events were considered non-serious by the reporter.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; not able to breathe or talk; Her throat was closing up; This is a spontaneous report from contactable pharmacists and an other hcp and a nurse. A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EN5318) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 15:15 in right deltoid at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included high blood pressure medication. Patient was not able to breathe or talk. Her throat was closing up. They had to use epinephrine to help her breath. It was reported as anaphylactic reaction. The vaccine was administered at 15:15, patient was interacting with HCPs who asked basic questions and at some point (15:17) patient was not responsive, patient was not able to breath and talk. All events started from 25Jan2021 15:17. Patient was administered Epipen (also reported as Benadryl and Epinephrine) and &#34;she came back&#34;. Patient was taken to hospital. Patient refused to call an ambulance. She was taken to hospital. The patient was not seen in the Emergency Department. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. Unknown if covid tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient has not received any other vaccines around the time of bnt162b2 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included heart rate with result of went up as soon as epipen was administered, O2 saturation and vitals with unknown results, all on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk.

                                                Two days after the 2nd injection I started to have chest pain and not feel right. I went to the Station where I volunteer. I did and EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I went to the ER. They gave me 4 baby aspirin to take and some blood work. I was told the blood work showed elevated levels consistent with a blood clot as well. I had a CT scan to rule out a clot in my heart or lungs. Which it was negative. I was released and told to see a cardiologist in the next few days. I saw the cardiologist two days later who said I ended up with Pericarditis and that it should resolve on its own. I was feeling better until two days ago when I developed chest pain again. I again went to my fire station I volunteer for and did an EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I am currently waiting for treatment from my cardiologist.

This 43-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), (Lot number: EL1285) via intramuscular route on 29Dec2020 14:30 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.

No other vaccine received in four weeks. Patient hospitalized for stroke on 31Dec2020 two days after vaccine (Days of hospitalization: 4). Day of vaccine-6 hours after patient had dizzy and lightheaded for about 45 min then went away. On 31Dec2020 at 19:15 had sudden loss of hearing to right ear and severe dizziness, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and felt like fainting. Paramedics were called-sent to ER, had CTA which showed partial blockage and received TPA. Treatment included TPA, fluids, medications, hospital stay, outpatient follow ups, physical therapy. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. Patient has been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: Negative and Pixel: Negative on 08Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events including stroke, dizzy/lightheaded/felt like fainting, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and sudden loss of hearing to right, and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the patient&#39;s underlying medical conditions, relevant lab tests would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

A 43-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 06:30 (at the age of 43-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 (with taste and smell loss). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 17Dec2020 at 14:00 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and experienced head to toe itching and progress with taste and smell disappeared/worse than COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylactic reaction on 16Jan2021 at 20:00 and itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss on an unspecified date. The patient reported that all the progress she made with taste and smell, disappeared after the vaccine and was actually worse than when she got COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild anaphylactic reaction, which included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The clinical outcome of mild anaphylactic reaction was not recovered and of itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

                                                Starting on February 24, 2021, I started to have shortness of breath. This slowly got worse until on March 2, 2021 I was unable to breathe in all the way and was getting a sharp pain in my side/back when I tried to breathe in more than half way. I then went to the emergency room recognizing the symptom as likely being a pulmonary embolism, as I had experienced one four years earlier. It was, in fact, a PE. I was in the hospital for five days as they treated the clots with blood thinners. I slowly got my breathing more back to normal and was discharged. They are still runnying myriad tests to try to determine the cause or causes, but I thought it wise to report here in case the vaccine is a factor. I received my second dose on 2/26/21, a few days before I went to the hospital but my symptoms started a few days before that.

                                                Patient was extremely anxious prior to vaccine.  She told me she did get seizures but she took medication for it and I informed her that it would still be recommended to get the vaccine.  She was visibly anxious even after vaccine.  Immediately after she began crying to her friend and said she &#34;was just SO afraid of needles&#34;.  I told her to take some deep breaths and after a minute or two she went to the observation room.  Approximately 15 minutes later she rushed back into the room looking like she might hyperventilate or have hypoglycemia (shaking, cold sweats).  She sat down and I tried to calm her down.  I asked someone to get her orange juice.  During the next couple minutes she did not seem to be getting any better and started shaking.  I requested someone call 911.  Another staff was helping so I moved to get and administer an epi-pen injection.  By this time the patient was not responsive, but was still breathing.  I instructed staff to help move her to the floor for monitoring and if needed, cpr.  She regain partial consciousness.  Her breath and pulse were always present, so there was no need to begin cpr.  After a few minutes EMT arrived and transported patient to local hospital.  During all of this, other employees at the facility were attempting to contact family members, which they were eventually able to do. About 30 minutes later the staff informed me they had spoken to family members who were at the hospital and that she was improving, but they had not seen her yet.

A 44-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE solution for injection; lot: EN6201, expiry: Jun2021), intramuscular (IM) on left (L) arm (at the age of 44years) on 16Feb2021 at 12:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (lot: EN5318, expiry: Jun2021) IM on L arm on 28Jan2021 at 14:45 that 45 minutes after administration (on 28Jan2021) the patient experienced tingling sensation on lip which was with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment and recovered on unspecified date. Medical history included hypertension, allergic to fish (treatment were adrenaline (EPIPEN), corticosteroid and antihistamine) and ongoing BP. Concomitant medications included ongoing hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril (LISINOPRIL &#43; HIDROCLOROTIAZIDA) and ongoing unspecified Vitamins daily. The patient previously took prochlorperazine maleate (COMPAZINE) and metoclopramide (REGLAN) which were medications she took while pregnancy, gabapentin and hydromorphone hydrochloride (DILAUDID) where the patient experienced allergies from these drugs and treatment were adrenaline (EPIPEN), corticosteroid and antihistamine. There was no covid prior vaccination and was covid tested post vaccination with Nasal Swab (Sofia SARS Antigen) on 04Feb2021 with result of negative. The patient experienced severe anaphylaxis attack on 16Feb2021 at 12:30 (30 minutes after the administration of 2nd dose) which resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event) with treatment included Intravenous IV diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) &#43; prednisone &#43; famotidine (PEPCID), GI cocktail, Heart monitoring. The HCP (patient) was on observation for 30 minutes when she started with tingling sensation, sweating and feeling hot (in Feb2021). They took BP=180/120 (in Feb2021). They administered IV diphenhydramine hydrochloride &#43; prednisone &#43; famotidine. She was feeling lightheaded (in Feb2021). She stayed in observation for 4 hours until recovered. She was sent home and prescribed prednisone and loratadine (CLARITIN) daily. HCP stated that she has an episode yesterday (16Feb2021), she was feeling tired, the sweating came back and her BP was high. Today (19Feb2021) her BP was stable. The patient reported tachycardia under information on organ involvement (in Feb2021). The patient required medical intervention but not hospitalized nor admitted to an intensive care unit. No other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the events and did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the events. The outcome was recovered for the events anaphylaxis and dizziness both in Feb2021, and hypertension on 19Feb2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Anaphylaxis  cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 44-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELI283), via an unspecified route of administration single dose on 12Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation. First dose was received on 22Dec2020 10:00 left arm (lot# EJI695). Medical history included chronic skin condition. No other vaccine was received in four weeks.

The patient was hospitalized due to the events from 11Feb2021. Patient reported to be a healthy 44 year old woman with no history of hypertension or high cholesterol. She was now on 7 different medications to protect her heart, including blood thinners and antihypertensives that result in daily headaches and fatigue. She had had several repeat episodes of chest pain which has required taking sublingual nitroglycerin. She was off work for an undetermined amount of time. Her primary care physician was baffled by her case and reached out to a number of experts who have agreed that her heart attack was caused by a thrombus formation/coagulopathy most definitely related to the Covid vaccines she received.  The events outcome was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  myocardial infarction and other events. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this 44-years-old patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline and during subject drug therapy, echocardiogram, electrolytes, chemistry panel and coronary angiogram, and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

At about 1:45am on 1/13/2021, was feeling very achy and uncomfortable, so I went downstairs to get some Tylenol. Rapid heart rate and sweating, so much I had to sit down in the kitchen for a few minutes. Eventually took the Tylenol, and as I was heading back upstairs, I passed out (I don&#39;t remember going down to the floor) and dropped the cup of water I was taking with me. Was out for less than 30 seconds. A couple episodes of heaving/vomiting small amounts of liquid while on the floor. Made it back to bed and was starting to feel improved around 4:00am.

Laid my head down on my arms on the table. Do not remember getting up, but remember walking through the kitchen in front of the refrigerator, reaching up to feel my pulse, felt two beats which were too far apart and thought to myself, &#34;I&#39;m going to faint&#34;.

Was taken for evaluation. Was given IV NS (I think 1000mls). Labwork was drawn. CXR, CT, and EKG.

A 47-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:49 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   There were no known medical history or concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced nausea, headache, and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine.

                                                Pt felt dizzy and nauseous after vaccine administration. When she tried to get up, she experienced syncope for about one minute. We administered Epi-pen and pt regain consciousness. Asked facility and patient if 911 call was needed, but patient refused. We monitored her blood pressure for over 1 hours and she stabilized at her baseline. We released her to go home and she will continue to monitor other potential adverse reactions.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; neuropathy in fingers, toes, roof of mouth/lips; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 48-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EL0140) at single dose on left arm on 30Dec2020 at 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma (controlled); hypertension diagnosis 1 year ago; allergies to medications, food and environmental. Concomitant medications in two weeks included antihypertensives - amlodipine and losartan. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 30Dec2020 at 9:15 AM, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction within 10 minutes of administration, neuropathy in fingers, toes, roof of mouth/lips. Neuropathy continued to date. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment Epinephrine IM (intramuscular) and IV (intravenous) steroids. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of anaphylactic reaction and neuropathy peripheral due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including serum tryptase and nerve conduction studies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.   This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

Patient was laid flat on a couch, but then passed out and was not responsive to sternal rub.  After a code was called, the patient woke up.  At no time was there a loss of pulse or SOB.  Patient was transported to the ER and was subsequently discharged same day.  Patient did report that prior to the vaccination, she ran 13 miles in the morning, which may have had something to do with the reaction.

                                                &#34;I received the Pfizer Covid vaccine Wed afternoon around 4pm. Thursday morning around 9:30 I started with severe pain in my left leg. The pain worsened through the day and my leg began swelling. No other symptoms at all. This morning my leg was twice the size of my right leg so I went to the ER. I live in so I&#39;m at ED. I have a massive blood clot running the the length of my leg - from my thigh to my ankle. I&#39;m very lucky I got here so fast! I?m a very healthy 49 year old with no history of DVT or blood clots so they dug further to find out why. A cat scan showed I have a congenital condition called May Thurner Syndrome. I?m so relieved to have an answer and it?s fixable! The vascular doctors are not 100% convinced that?s not all that was going on as I was born with the syndrome and I?ve gone this long without a clot. So they are doing lots of labs to see if anything else shows up. This is where we are at. I?m being admitted to take care of the clot.&#34;

                                                Received COVID vaccine 1 on 1/13 and COVID vaccine #2 2/1.  49 y/o previously healthy female who had a COVID 19 exposure ~ 1/3. The person she was exposed to tested positive 1/6 (daughter had a fever and cough). On 1/11 the patient received the 1st dose of the Pfizer vaccine. 12-24 hours after the Pfizer vaccine she developed fevers, malaise, myalgias that lasted 2-3 days (Called off work). She then returned to a normal state of health. On 2/1 she received the second dose of the vaccine. On 2/6 she developed right pleuritic chest pain so went to an urgent care. COVID 19 PCR was positive and CXR unremarkable. She was told to take naproxen and her pleuritic chest pain slowly improved. On 2/8 she started to have general malaise followed by nausea. On 2/11 she developed increased nausea and vomiting followed by diarrhea-eventually that day she had a near syncopal episode prompting her presentation to the hospital. Seen at an outside hospital between 2/11-2/12. CT abd/pelvis showed patchy ground glass opacities at the base of the lungs and she was noted to have diffuse mural thickening. There was concern for possible cholecystitis so a perc cholecystostomy tube was placed. Ultimately she developed significant hypoxic respiratory failure and had to be intubated.She was transferred to another hospital on 2/12. Initially she was started on treatment with dexamethasone but continued to clinically get worse. Also on empiric antibiotics.

Woke at 4:00 am feeling very achy. Went to kitchen for ibuprofen, took two. Started feeling very nauseated. Went to master bathroom to urinate, and started feeling like I was going to faint. Tried to make it three steps to my small sofa outside bathroom door. That?s the last thing I remember. My husband heard me fall. I had fallen chin first on hardwood floor. He found me lying in a pool of blood. Before going to ER in the next 15 minutes, i had an extreme bout of diarrhea. At ER, I learned that I had Broken both my condyals in jaw and fractured lower mandible. At ER and hospital on 2/2, threw up multiple (about 7-8) times, even with anti-nausea drugs in IV. Doctor put an anti-nausea patch behind my ear but not sure if it helped. Had surgery to set it on 2/3/21.

                                                anaphylaxis; throat swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 50-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, lipids (as reported) and asthma. The patient was known allergies: codeine, iodine, shellfish, latex, and cefatrizine propyleneglycolate (CEFTIN). Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in hospital. The patient experienced anaphylaxis and throat swelling on 22Dec2020 with outcome of recovered in Dec2020.  The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment of epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, observation was received for the events.    Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis and throat swelling cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

Transported to nearest hospital, I had to have emergency surgery on left ankle, by Dr.  A plate and screws were placed in my ankle to stabilize the break.  I am being treated and monitored by my general doctor for the concussion.  I am currently non-weight bearing on my ankle, for a minimum of 2-4 weeks.  I am unable to work due to the ankle break and concussion, for an undetermined amount of time. I am scheduled to meet with Dr. on the 4th of March, at which time he stated  he will want to begin physical therapy, once the break has reached an adequate stage of healing.  I will be re-evaluated by my general Dr. for the concussion in 2 weeks.

A 50-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6205), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date) at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. During her 15 minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience throat tightness. Monitored patient for severe reaction symptoms, including but not limited to blood pressure abnormality, chest pain, collapse, hypotension, increased swelling, rapid progression of symptoms, respiratory distress, skin changes and tongue swelling. Treatment included: antihistamines. Follow up response to treatment: excellent. Patient discharge: Stable to go home and follow up with PCP. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of vaccine BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be excluded based on the plausible temporal relationship and product safety profile.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ehics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.

I called my PCP who ordered an EKG, CXR, COVID swab, a metabolic panel,  a CBC, and a D-dimer. My D-dimer was elevated and he called me to go directly to the emergency department, which I did and had a CTA chest. I was diagnosed with multifocal pulmonary emboli in my right lung with a slight pleural effusion on my left lung. I had a duplex ultrasound of my legs which was negatve for DVT, and an echocardiogram which was within normal limits. I was finally diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism, given a Heparin bolus and started on a Heparin IV infusion. Ultimately, I transitioned to Eliquis PO and was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours.

                                                Heart attack / she had a MI / diagnosed as a NSTEMI; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). This 52-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in left arm, on 07Jan2021, for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis) from 1998 and vitiligo from 1988. She was overweight. She had really no other risk factors. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced heart attack and she had a MI, then a cardiac catherization that was normal and a normal echo as well. She said it was diagnosed as a NSTEMI and not a large MI, the smaller version. These events required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 12Jan2021. MI occurred after she finished clinic and she was not standing or doing anything, just sitting and she had chest pain. Her office was right next to the ER, so she received treatment within an hour and they were able to help her. She said that her hospital couldn&#39;t do a cardiac cath, so on 11Jan2021 they moved her to an hospital which was another treatment facility. When she had her MI they gave her acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and sublingual nitroglycerin. They tested her troponin and did an EKG which was abnormal on an unspecified date in Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 troponin was increased. When they treated her with nitroglycerin and Aspirin, two hours later her EKG was normal and her troponin came down overnight on 09Jan2021, which was when they said for sure that she had a heart attack. The patient said it was very scary to have a heart attack, but thankfully there was not a lot of damage done and she was able to get treatment quickly. She did not think the event was disabling since they did not see much damage to her heart muscle, it was a near miss kind of thing. She said it was life changing in that she will now be on medication forever, she will be on at least a baby Aspirin and probably something like a statin for the rest of her life. She was recovering, it was unknown what the lasting effects may be, she felt normal but tired from her hospital stay. Heart attack resolved on 08Jan2021.

So in the meantime she went to the ER and they took X rays, and they told her that she was starting to develop pneumonia. She was going back to work tomorrow, being that she was on the antibiotics now, still had swelling in the arm, and had pneumonia, should she still get the 2nd shot. She noticed the swelling Saturday after New Years. She was also achy all over in her neck, arm, and shoulder (Jan2021). She felt sick to her stomach, this was all the first Week of Jan2021. She went to the ER, she was not admitted and came home the same day. She went to the ER on 08Jan2021. 08Jan2021 was also when the pneumonia was diagnosed. The name of antibiotic she was prescribed was doxycycline. She started it on Saturday 09Jan2021, she was prescribed 100 mg 2 pills a day for 10 days. When they did the X ray, they said that the pneumonia had showed up, or she was just starting to get pneumonia.

She was schedule for the second dose today. She did reschedule for Friday, and wanted to know if she should still get it. In the ER, they said it could have been a blood clot and so they did a scan to find blood clots but it was negative.

A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Jan2021 (at the age of 53-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient experienced electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormal and large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm on 08Jan2021; numbness and tingling in right thumb on 10Jan2021; reddened area with bruising with nodule on 26Jan2021; chest discomfort and heart attack in Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: Two days later after vaccination, she noticed bruising on various parts of body. The first bruise she noticed on the 08Jan2021. It was probably about 3.5 inches in length 2 inches in width. The patient stated that it did not necessarily have a shape. She had a large bruise on her right buttock. Two days later, she noticed a similar in size bruise on the front of her right thigh. Then a couple days later, she noticed three quarter size bruises on her right arm (two on the inner part of arm, and one on the outer, both on upper arm). The very next day, she developed the same sizing bruise. It was about the same size on her left upper arm. There were no other side effects besides the bruising. There was no itching or redness, no skin, respiratory, or neurological issues. The day before her second dose, on 26Jan2021, she noticed a 4 inch reddened area with a two centimeter nodule inside that bruise. The patient stated that the initial bruises began to heal. They are not as dark as they were. They were reported to have started out red and then turned black and blue. The patient also had numbness and tingling in her right thumb. She was having some chest discomfort after the initial vaccination that is still ongoing. The chest discomfort prompted her to go to urgent care on 08Jan2021, where she had an abnormal EKG on 08Jan2021. The patient was told to follow up with a cardiologist. The patient saw the cardiologist on 25Jan2021, where he did an EKG and ECHO. The EKG was abnormal and ECHO with unknown results on 25Jan2021, but the doctor was unable to determine when the heart attack occurred. The cardiologist also ran labs: a troponin to see if anything was acutely going on, and a D Dimer to evaluate her clotting factors; both were negative on 25Jan2021. The cardiologist recommended a computerised tomogram (CT) scan, which was still scheduled at the time of report. The clinical outcome of large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm, chest discomfort, numbness and tingling in right thumb, and reddened area with bruising with nodule was not recovered and of heart attack and EKG abnormal was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

There is a plausible temporal association between vaccines administration and onset of the reported event. It is unclear what is the nature of the vaccine co-administered with BNT162b2. Currently no information is available on the co-administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with other vaccines.

                                                Sudden onset of extreme vertigo with associated near syncope (felt like vagal). No vomiting and no real nausea. Vertigo still present but now minimal. That same night I had a mild fever, but I am not concerned by this. Had some mild vertigo after the first vaccination (lot EH9899) but it only lasted 48 hrs.

My husband was making breakfast.  I came downstairs, ate, had a cup of coffee, then got a glass of water and an ice pack and sat on a recliner in the living room.  I don&#39;t remember much of the rest.  It was like a dream.  My husband said I let out a yell, my arms flailed and my eyes were very strange.  I lost muscle strength in my lift side mimicking a stroke.  He called 911.  I was taken to Emergency facility where I gained consciousness.  I was then transferred to Hospital.  So far every test has come back negative.  I have an EEG scheduled for this Thursday.

                                                increased AFib episodes; joint ache esp to left knee with pain; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 54-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 28Jan2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 54-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib), depression, aortic stenosis and allergy to sulfa, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included losartan, HCTZ, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), vitamin D3, magnesium and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12).  The patient previously took LEVOQUIN and prednisone and experienced allergies. On 02Feb2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced increased AFib episodes, joint ache esp. to left knee with pain and headache.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 (nasal swab) test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included acupuncture and the events required physician office visit. The patient outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event atrial fibrillation is related to BNT162B2.  The event only occurred 4 days after vaccination.  And the patient had underlying atrial fibrillation, which is considered the most likely cause of the reported event.

I had already left the drive-thru vaccination clinic and was driving to the hospital emergency room where I work. I informed my colleagues of my symptoms and was treated for anaphylaxis with IV diphenhydramine and famotidine over several hours. I was given a prescription for a prednisone taper for the next 6 days.

Then on Wednesday morning, March 31st (two weeks after receiving the first dose), she was found in bed by my mother, unable to walk or talk, her face was drooping, she was very sweaty, and had defecated on herself. My mother called the ambulance. She was transported to Hospital where it was determined she had suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke. She was immediately transported by ambulance to another Hospital. She spent one day in ICU and then was put on palliative care. She died around 12/N on Friday, April 2nd, two days after the stroke.

I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

Her husband and I walked her over to the cot and medical treatment area. Her pulse felt thready and weak while walking and her gait was unsteady. As soon as she sat, then lay on the cot she lost consciousness and did not respond to verbal or noxious stimuli over the next few minutes. I gave her one dose of an epi-pen into her left mid outer thigh but she still did not regain consciousness so we called a &#34;Rapid Response code&#34; for transport to the E.R. for further treatment and stabilization.

A 57-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech) (lot# EK9231, exp date Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 29Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), via an unspecified route of administration, at unknown posology, on 29Dec2020 (20 minutes prior to taking bnt162b2), for anaphylactic reaction. Medical history included ongoing thyroid disorder. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), diltiazem (unknown trade name), losartan (unknown manufacturer), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), levothyroxine (unknown trade name), ongoing levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid disorder and metformin (unknown trade name). Previously the patient received unspecified influenza vaccine (reported as flu shot) for immunisation, on unspecified date, and experienced anaphylactic reaction treated with Benadryl. On 29Dec2020, an hour after getting the vaccine, the patient experienced her voice became raspy, she could hardly talk, she could barely talk with outcome of unknown, her hand and whole arm swelled up with outcome of unknown, trouble breathing with outcome of unknown. The reporter stated that her voice and everything reacted and made her go to the emergency room on 29Dec2020. She reported that had adverse effect more than normal. The event &#34;Her voice became raspy, she could hardly talk, she could barely talk&#34; caused patient&#39;s hospitalization on unknown date. The action taken as a result of the events with diphenhydramine hydrochloride was post-therapy. Therapeutic measures were taken at the emergency room as a result of the events and included treatment with Topcid and Benadryl every 6 hours, 2x 40 mg of steroid.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up (02Jan2021): New information received from the same contactable healthcare professional reporting for herself includes: patient&#39;s details, medical history, events updated, vaccine lot# and exp date, concomitant, seriousness of event &#34;Her voice became raspy, she could hardly talk, she could barely talk&#34; added as hospitalization, historical vaccine, suspect Benadryl details, therapeutic measures updated.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), intramuscularly on 29Jan2021 at 09:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and known allergies to medication. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and metoprolol, which were reported as medications in two weeks. It was reported that other vaccines in four weeks were prescribed. On 31Jan2021 at 09:00 AM, the patient experienced the roof of her mouth shedded (was raw) and bled for a few days. A few days later (2021), she felt like she was having a heart attack. There was no treatment for the events. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on 2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event myocardial infarction cannot be excluded.

                                                I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive.; I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day; I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise; I was covered in sweat; vomited; I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F; sore; I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).   This 58-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 09Jan2021 06:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation on unknown date (1 episode), allergic to Keflex. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 22Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation.  On 10Jan2021 01:00 AM, the patient experienced: I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in i was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive (loss of consciousness) (medically significant), I had my 2nd vaccine at work early sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day (feeling abnormal), Iwoke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise (malaise), I was covered in sweat (hyperhidrosis), vomited (vomiting), I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F (pyrexia), sore (pain), I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response (seizure). No treatment required. The outcome of the events was recovered.   The events were described as follows: I am healthy RN with no active medical problems. I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day, I expected this so was not alarmed and went to bed around 10pm. I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise and went to the bathroom in case I might vomit, etc. and I tried to have a BM. I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive. He yelled at me for about 10 seconds and I came to, I was covered in sweat. I asked him to walk me back to the bedroom where I again passed out, fell to the floor and hit the bed, then was unresponsive again for about 10 seconds then came to again and vomited. After this I felt completely relieved of my malaise. I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F. After this I was sore but otherwise completely okay, the next day I had a temp of 99.5°F. Today I am back to normal. I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event &#34;began to pass out&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

                                                After being observed for approximately 20 minutes and patient walked to her car without assistance I was called to assess the patient in the parking lot for troubles breathing.  EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; palpitations; tachycardia/heart rate 141; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP). This HCP reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of two reports.  This 58-year-old female HCP (patient) reported for herself that received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176) on 10Jan2021 at 0.3 mL single by intramuscular injection left arm for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension and diabetes type 2, both diagnosed about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that a few days after receiving the 2nd dose (on 14Jan2021), she went into atrial fibrillation and had been having palpitations ever since. She had a cardiology appointment in a few weeks and they started her on apixaban (ELIQUIS). Lab data on 14Jan2021 included EKG: normal sinus and Kardiamobile (a medical grade ECG): it showed tachycardia and at least one other time showed atrial fibrillation, heart rate 141. The outcome of palpitations was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown. Reporter seriousness for atrial fibrillation and palpitations was medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of  atrial fibrillation cannot be fully excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.  ,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021111803 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient
