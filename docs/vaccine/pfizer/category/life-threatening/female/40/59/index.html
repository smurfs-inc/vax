                                                December 28,(before the vaccine) I was exposed to COVID at work.  I started feeling feverish on Monday at work. I needed to use my inhaler twice that day. I couldn&#39;t stop coughing at work. At home that night - used inhaler again and I had an elevated temperature - 99. something is high for me. I missed work on Tuesday. Couldn&#39;t breathe and it hurt my chest to breathe. My temp was over 100. Dr appt - went to it late afternoon he wanted me test for COVID. Took vitals - mostly normal - temp.; checked OXYGEN - normal. COVID test - was positive. Temperature went to 101 that night - couldn&#39;t breathe good - couldn&#39;t stop shaking; I was aching and I was in pain; I couldn&#39;t feel warm enough. Tried to sleep and drink fluids. Still didn&#39;t have test results from COVID test on Thursday - temp was up to 102 now. The doctor said they couldn&#39;t do anything until they had results back of test. Friday - 101 and 102.8 - temperature that day. After hours clinic - I called them - Dr - I had to gasp for every breath and I was coughing a lot. He prescribed Benzymidate - cough pearls and Azithromycin  - started taking those that night. By Sunday afternoon, my fever continued and I still didn&#39;t have COVID results yet.  My mom took me to  Urgent Care on Sunday - still running fever; he looked at my lungs and listened -  he could hear wheezing and crackling in my lungs - he determined pneumonia - he didn&#39;t know what kind - he gave me Augmentin - he told me to use both my Albuterol inhaler and steriod haler;  Mucinex expectorant twice a day; Vit C and Vit D and Elderberry and Tylenol and two antibiotics. Saturday - before I went to Urgent Care on Sunday - I noticed I couldn&#39;t smell.  Monday is when I got the positive test for COVID.   Provided info to work and I tried to figure out how to work. Even though I was still very sick, I worked again online on Monday. But I couldn&#39;t keep working - got really whoozy; coughing and gasping  felt like I was going to pass out and felt like I could hardly breathe.  My mom called 911 for me. I managed to get to the bathroom - but having trouble breathing and I almost threw up - heard ringing in my ears and room was spinning. There is a lot of things after that I don&#39;t remember - when they moved me to ambulance to hospital  bed I realized I had an IV in me.  They stabilized me. They let me go home. I took the rest of the week off from work. Took a lot of medication and was keeping up with my vital during that week - 99.8 - 102.8 - for ten days I ran that fever. Broke Jan 20th. I went back to work on Jan 25. Still had to use an inhaler a lot. I&#39;m slowly getting taste back; I can&#39;t taste flavor but can taste salt . I&#39;m slowly getting smell back. I still have a lot of congestion but not as bad. Ears were bothering me this weekend so I did go to urgent care on they put me on a third antibiotic for an ear infection. Gave COVID to my son and my mother. Still have trouble catching me breath. January 23  - my isolation was extended to . the county extended my isolation period because of my family getting COVID. I&#39;m about 75% recovered, I&#39;d say.

I began bleeding and cramping and having headaches approximately 10 days after my second dose. I sought medical attention and was told that my baby no longer had a heart beat and that growth (based on ultrasound) had stopped around the 9 week mark. I had medical assistance to physically miscarry the deceased fetus. I have one healthy living son (2 years,  4 months old) who was delivered without complications naturally.

                                                My first dose was 1/14. I found out I was pregnant on 1/26/21 and I miscarried at about 10 weeks. About 15 mins after I got the vaccine, I had a racing heartrate and my palms were hot, but it went away. Around 3pm, I had a right frontal headache. I took a nap and it went away. About 5am Fri, I woke up to severe arm pain and it felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach. I took about 400mg of Ibuprofen, went to sleep and was fine when I woke up. About 5pm Friday, I began having vaginal bleeding. I called my doctor and was able to get in on Feb 11th. At my OB/GYN appointment, they tested my blood and urine, which confirmed my pregnancy. The NP examined me and told me that the bleeding was coming from my cervix, so they sent me for an ultrasound the following week. That&#39;s when I was given my calculated date of 10 weeks. A gestational sac was observed, but they weren&#39;t sure if a fetus was present. I had to see my doctor every week since I was still bleeding and that continued until March 18th, when I lost the pregnancy completely. I took my specimen to the doctor the following day. They told me that they were sending it out to be tested, but I&#39;m not sure if the results are back. They did confirm that it was a fetus.

                                                Experienced brief, minor dizziness about 10 minutes after the shot. On my drive home about 15-20 min. after the shot, I experienced more severe symptoms of anaphylaxis. I was able to breathe but my airway was constricted and swollen. After arriving home, I called pharmacy but their pharmacists were out on lunch. My primary care doctor was closed (Good Friday). I waited until the pharmacist was back from lunch and they advised Benadryl (I took 50 g at 2pm) and to have someone with me for the next 24 hours. Symptoms improved some but by 5pm I still couldn&#39;t take a deep breath normally and was concerned about eating food. I went to the ER where they admitted me and administered Pepcid and dexamethasone at 6:22pm. After about an hour and a half, I felt better and was released. Once home, I ate food and that irritated my throat again so I kept an EpiPen nearby that evening just in case. The next morning I felt 100% with no side effects.

I do have a history of mild nosebleeds but this was unusual. I do not take any blood thinning medications. The silver nitrate did stop the bleeding. The ER ductus was not concerned that this was vaccine related but I thought it was unusual enough to report.

A 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3248) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 15Jan2021 (at the age of 40-year-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included lupus. Concomitant medication included hydroxychloroquine sulfate (PLAQUENIL [HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE]). The patient had blood clots in left lung which turned into an infarction on 22Feb2021. The event resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient was hospitalized for the events for 3 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included blood thinners and anti-inflammatory meds. COVID test post vaccination on 03Mar2021 Nasal Swab: Negative. Patient was not pregnant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Drug causality would seem unlikely fo rBNT162B2 since there is no plausible mechanism implicating the subject drug to the events. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Took 50mg prednisone 2 benadryl and albuterol inhaler.  Breathing got better and hives went away but still had swollen throat and took pepcid. Headache afterwards but that&#39;s typical of an allergic reaction.  I can&#39;t be sure it was from the vaccine or not but nothing I did yesterday would normally trigger that reaction

I waited to see if it would go away and then a couple minutes later noticed my lips started itching and swelling and from there it just got worse.  I told the nurse practitioner that I think I was having a reaction, she had me take a seat told her my entire mouth throat &amp; lips felt swollen and itching and she looked and said it was full blown anaphylaxis reaction.  Administered EpiPen, benadryl and called ambulance where they took me to medial emergency department.

                                                Noticed swelling in my left hand around Feb 6th, but by Feb 13th entire left arm was swollen and warm and observed blue/purple skin coloring on upper arm and lower arm was red.  Went to ER on Feb 15th, and ultrasound revealed a blood clot near the junction of the subclavian vein and cephalic veins.  Diagnosis was idiopathic subclavian deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Started on enoxaparin and warfarin on Feb 15th.  Referred to hematology and coumadin clinic to monitor INR.

                                                Anaphylactic shock? Shortly after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore and I had a severe headache. Approximately 24-48 hours after I received the vaccine I started developing a red, hot, itchy raised rash on my ears and buttocks which became more prevalent and peaked around 80-90 hours later. Approximately 82 hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feeI nauseous, dizzy, and fatigued so I stood up to get ready for bed early. While brushing my teeth, I went pale white and felt like I was going to vomit. I put the toothbrush down and got on floor. My pulse felt like it had stopped. I tried to check my pulse and I could only detect one beat every other second. I called for my spouse and by the time he got to bathroom I was passed out. I came back to after about 30 seconds and was convulsing from chills. He put a blanket on me and grabbed my Apple Watch to try to get my pulse which read in the 50s (so I assume it was much lower when I passed out). My hands and feet were tingly and I stayed on the floor until my pulse got back up. I then had diarrhea. At this point in time the rash was most prevalent and was present mostly on my buttocks but also on my ears, scalp, pointer finger on right hand, thighs, and hips. I went to doctor the following morning an my vitals, blood sugar, EKG, urine screen were stable and indicated no issues. 106 hours later I still have the rash on all areas mentioned and am dizzy, nauseous, and fatigued.

April 14th I got my second dose of Covid&#39;s vaccine. After an hour I started having  cramps. Around 1:15 PM I had a bleed (light red). Around 2:00 pm I was seen at the doctor&#39;s office. She did a new ultrasound. The doctor said she couldn&#39;t find a heartbeat during the ultrasound exam and that I was having a miscarriege

                                                Short Summary: DVT followed by Multiple Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms (significant blood clots in both lungs). Context: After the first vaccine (about a week before my second vaccine), I self diagnosed myself with a calf injury due to extreme pain in my calf that felt like a continuous cramp. The extreme pain lasted until my second shot (about a week). When going for my second shot, I reported a rash with hives on my lower abdomen that had appeared within five hours of my first shot, so they requested I stay a little longer for observation. That night I began having some breathing difficulties, but assumed they were to be expected. The breathing difficulties continued to get worse until my nurse practitioner told me to go directly to the nearest ER (2/16/21), where I was officially diagnosed with multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms. I was admitted to healthcare facility for 24-48 hours, until an EKG revealed heart abnormalities that caused them to use a physician&#39;s transport to move me to another unit. I was discharged from the hospital on 2/2/21 after I stabilized from heparin shots, avoiding more invasive procedures. I have been in ongoing recovery since then, receiving ongoing care from a hematologist and pulmonologist. A little extra context for you - I arrived to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis and have an endocrinologist since hospitalization that has diagnosed me with Type 1 Diabetes (previously misdiagnosed as type 2 - I&#39;m now on insulin which is controlling my blood glucose well).

It did not escalate to full anaphylaxis but remained a steady wheezing feeling for a number of hours after. It dissipated be evening but returned 4 days later along with tingling in my lips that comes and goes. It continues on and off 2 weeks post vaccine.  I do not have any other illnesses or reasons to think this other than a side effect from the vaccine. I do not have a history of asthma either.

                                                5 days after receiving my first vaccine, my heart went into Atrial Fibulation. That has never happened before. I was put into the hospital to get it back into normal rythm. I was 9 1/2 weeks pregnant when the incident occured. I do have some minor heart issues already known such as Mitral Valve Prolapse and a small PFO. However other than a flutter here and there the last 25 years of my life, I havent had any issues. It makes me wonder if the vaccine set it off.

A 41-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm left on 21Mar2021 around 16:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) (at the age of 41-year-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergic to shellfish, ongoing systemic scleroderma, ongoing raynaud&#39;s syndrome (6 years ago) and interstitial lung disease (6 years ago). Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), at 5mg three times a day, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) via oral at 5mg once a day; mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT) at 1000 mg twice a day, hydroxychloroquine phosphate (PLAQUENIL) at 200mg twice a day, omeprazole (PROTONIX) at 40mg twice a day, sildenafil citrate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) at 20mg three times a day, atorvastatin (LIPITOR) at 40mg once a day, gabapentin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) at 300mg once a day; all are ongoing and taken for systemic scleroderma. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. On 21Mar2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction and was rushed into to the emergency room after 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine. The patient stated she called the CDC they recommend not to take vaccine of the second dose. The patient stated now she just called and it has been three days since she has been really sick and they told her to call us because doctor at the emergency room at the hospital and specialist because she has an underlying disease (Scleroderma) and told her to double check if she does not take booster of Pfizer vaccine what is the effect in her body? patient stated they are giving her advice that if she does not take it can she can take the J&amp;J. The patient explained after she was administered the vaccine, she went to the waiting area where they told her she should be held for 30 minutes then in about 15 minutes she started getting a hot feeling around her arms and left side of her body so she took off her sweater thinking that would make her comfortable because she was uncomfortable. The patient stated 25 minutes after sitting there the nurse asked if she was ok, so she went out for fresh air that day it was not hot in the hospital but the temperature was around 60 on Sunday so it was really nice weather and she went outside for a fresh breath of air for 5 minutes, stayed took off mask, and felt relieved. The patient went back inside of the room and felt itching of her throat, 25 minutes receiving the vaccine and it stopped when she received the epi pen. The patient stated she thinks she recovered from because since Sunday she has had different effects.

The patient stated the doctor gave her a shot of epi pen and hooked her up. They did a lot of things in the emergency room that she does not remember. She only remembers her whole hand was purple and they gave her the epi shot. The doctor asked does she know what he was holding, she responded an epi pen, and the doctor said yes. She confirmed she has never used an epi pen before since she has not had any other allergic life-threatening reaction from a vaccine. The doctor said he was going to administer it right now because she cannot breathe. At this time, she was conscious and had a hard time breathing, but was listening. The doctor administered the shot and the hard time breathing and coughing stopped like 30 seconds after. However, she is still having a hard time to breathe. The patient stated the purple hands probably wore off after an hour but since she has Raynaud&#39;s disease it was hard for her to recover from circulation of oxygen in body.

The patient confirmed she did actually go to her physician&#39;s office. On 22Mar2021, the patient felt weak she was lying in her house the whole Monday and lying-in bed week and had no appetite. The patient had an asthmatic reaction on Tuesday (on 23Mar2021), like hard time breathing, and she called her pulmonologist, and it was not like emergency and she knows that because she has an underlying lung disease, so she used nebulizer every 6 hours and also used inhaler albuterol inhaler.

Medical history included pain, anxiety, two back surgeries previously, and smoke all the time. Concomitant medications included clonazepam (KLONOPIN); and pain medications for her back and anxiety medications (unspecified). She got her first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine 36 days ago (11Mar2021) and within 5 minutes, she had the worst migraine of her life. She has had two back surgeries previously and after the COVID vaccine, she felt like she had had her third back surgery that night (11Mar2021). That night, she was also throwing up, had diarrhea and was having horrible stomach cramps. Since then (Mar2021), her blood pressure had been so high that they were afraid that she was going to have a stroke at any minute. For her migraine, she had been to the hospital 4 times for it and they had given her three doses each time of the migraine cocktail and that hadn&#39;t touched her migraine. She went back to the doctor and her blood pressure and her pulse were both still high (2021) and with the migraine she was ready to jump off of the dock because it hurts so bad. She was on 4 medicines to try and combat what this vaccine had done to her. She can no longer function. She needed to know an antidote or something to get this out of her system. She stated that she &#34;is going to die from this&#34;. She didn&#39;t know what to do. They said she was going to have a stroke. She can&#39;t work and no one knows what to do because there were no studies on this because it is so new. She wanted it out of her body. Her life literally has turned into her just lying in bed and moaning in pain. She was in the emergency room (due to migraine), there were 3 people in there who had complained from the Pfizer vaccine (unspecified). She was calling because she got her first shot of COVID vaccine and she had a stroke (unspecified date in 2021) and she was going to die. She needed an antidote to get it out of her system because she been to the hospital 5 times now. She had migraine that is so bad that they gave her 4 doses of Topamax, it didn&#39;t touch it, she threw up everything she eats, she lost 30 pounds (2021) &amp; her blood pressure reached 200/198 and she smoked all the time, they said she had stroke. She had bad migraine and nothing helped at all. She had doctor appointment, and nobody can give her answer. Regarding second dose, that was 21 days after, but she was not going to get it (second shot) and they said she was 80 % vaccinated. At hospital, when she was in emergency room (for migraine), where they do lab tests (2021), they were fine. She was not getting better, getting worse (not clarified for all events). Date of hospitalization: the day after she got the vaccine and next was two days ago, 3 different times (further details unknown). She further stated that she was driving to doctor.

                                                About 15 mins after vaccine I felt a sudden onset of lightheadedness and feeling as if i would pass out, told the nurse  I was going to throw up.  I was given zofran and Dr monitored Vs.  I continued to experience waves of dizzyness, nausea, abdominal pain. Shaking followed (I felt so cold), along with frequent need to urinate and urgency to have a BM (loose) for several hours.  I was given fluids and monitored.  They gave Ativan 0.5mg 2.5 hrs later?  I was discharged home at 8:45p.m. by Dr  and told not to get the 2nd Vaccine.  Symptoms continued and worsened on day 3 with Shortness of breath, chest pain and tingling in my arms that spread to my legs, back and neck. The first week I could barley walk and was seen in the ER 2 times for chest pain, shortness of breath, dizzyness, tingling, heart racing, diarrhea, nausea, muscle weakness, insomnia due to shortness of breath (gasping) with heart racing, &amp; unable to control my body temperature.  Given Prednisone 40mg which exasperated symptoms.  1/13/21 In ER and given Benadryl 3 bags of fluids, potassium and sodium. Postural tachycardia was noticed.  Referral to Neurologist.High D-dimer at  ER on 1/16/21 CT scan performed to rule out blood clot in lungs. Reffered to Cardiologist. Metoprolol and Colchicine was started in Jan by Cardiologist Dr .  Weekly visits with Dr for the first couple months.  More meds started to decrease inflammation. Furthur referrals to Immunologist, infectious disease, and Rheumotology.  At 3 months worsening of tingling in my neck and headaches/burning that felt like shocks and shooting down neck and ears.  Neurologist performed 3 view MRI to rule out transverse Myelitis. In ER early April for new onset of Petechiae, CBC labs normal. Immunologist states he felt i experienced an allergic reaction followed by secondary anaphalaxis.  He is testing me for Mast cell activation syndrome (not diagnosed yet).  Now almost 4 months later still unable to work.  Waiting results to rule out POTS.  Currently battle daily fatigue, chest pressure/pain, lung SOB, heavyness/pressure, with any exertion.  I am limited with daily walking/normal activities.  Symptoms that come and go are tingling, nausea, diarrhea, flushing of frequent urination, neck pain, regulating temperature.

A contactable consumer reported that a 41-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; treprostinil sodium (REMODULIN), intravenous from 03Mar2020 to an unspecified date at 0.041 ug/kg, then at 0.045 ug/kg with therapy dates unspecified, and then at 0.049 ug/kg with therapy dates unspecified, for primary pulmonary arterial hypertension; and macitentan (OPSUMIT) on 11Jan2021, orally from 11Jan2021 at 10 mg, 1x/day for primary pulmonary hypertension. Medical history included ongoing primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. Concomitant medication included sildenafil citrate. On 15Jan2021, the patient had a blood clot in neck. The patient was hospitalized from 15Jan2021 to 16Jan2021 due to the blood clot in neck. It was reported that on 15Jan2021, which is 10 months 13 days after initiating IV Remodulin, the patient was hospitalized due to blood clot in her neck. The patient went to the emergency room on 15Jan2021 and she was planned to be admitted to change her catheter, later she was hospitalized on the same day and her Remodulin central line was changed as per the prior plans of getting the catheter changed. The patient was discharged on 16Jan2021. The patient then had a rash to her chest (dermatitis contact previously reported) that started on 20Jan2021. The patient believed it was from the original dressing that was placed after her catheter was replaced. The rash to left chest around her Remodulin catheter line (dermatitis contact previously reported) was also reportedly itchy at night. On an unknown date in 2021, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturations dropped to 85% on room air (oxygen saturation decreased). The patient continued to have rash on her chest (dermatitis contact previously reported). On 29Jan2021, 10 months 27 days after initiating IV Remodulin, the patient was in the emergency room due to increased shortness of breath, pressure on her chest, edema in her feet and a weight gain of 2 pounds overnight. All the tests were negative but during walking test, the patient&#39;s oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air. The patient was advised to wear mask continuously. 2 weeks after receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine, the patient had heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest pressure 2 weeks after receiving the first COVID-19 vaccine (dyspnoea and chest discomfort previously reported). The patient went to the ER (emergency room), had worked up and was seen by a pulmonologist, nothing was found, and the patient was released home. The prescribing physician&#39;s practice ordered her to wear oxygen (O2) continuously. The patient said that she only wears it when she leaves the house and at night and was fine. She felt this episode was related to the COVID-19 vaccine and was not receiving the second dose. The patient stated that her physician had took her off the Opsumit due to shortness of breath (dyspnoea previously reported). The events &#39;blood clot in neck&#39;, &#39;shortness of breath (dyspnea)&#39;, &#39;pressure on her chest&#39;, &#39;edema to her feet&#39;, &#39;weight gain of two pounds overnight&#39; and &#39;heart palpitations&#39;, resulted in emergency room visit. The event, &#39;diarrhea&#39;, was controlled with diphenoxylate and atropine (LOMOTIL). The patient had a walking distance test on an unspecified date in 2021 (results were not provided) and weight was 209 lbs on an unspecified date in 2021. The events, shortness of breath (dyspnea)&#39;, &#39;pressure on her chest&#39; and &#39;heart palpitations&#39;, was reported as serious (medically significant). The events rash on chest, and rash on chest possibly due to tape (dermatitis contact) had not resolved while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Follow-up (12Mar2021): This is a follow-up solicited report based on the information received by Pfizer. Additional information included medical history, suspect drug data, reaction details and clinical course details.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.  Follow-up (04May2021): This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information the events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the subject drug. There is a reasonable possibility that the drug contributed to occurrence of the event rash. The follow-up information received does not alter the previous company clinical evaluation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                About a month and 20 days after my second vaccine I had trouble breathing. I work in the hospital, so I thought maybe it was bronchitis, the mask made it harder to breathe. I had the weekend off and decided by Monday I would go to the doctor if not better. I woke up on Sunday, still achy, not wanting to move, couldn&#39;t really eat, I was just mostly drinking water. I woke up Monday and came back to bed, moved the blanket and then could barely breathe. My skin got very clamy, feeling scared and unsure if it was a heart attack. I called 911 and was taken to hospital to a shock trauma.  I am only back to work 4 hour days, and working with a pulmonologist.

When she got home in the evening and took it off blood ran down her arm but the bleeding stopped immediately. This has resolved. 12/29 at about 2:00 employee reports onset of tingling in the fingers of her right hand - index, middle, ring, and pinky. For about 2 hours the tingling was intense. As of 12/30 this has markedly improved and the tingling is intermittent. Later in the evening of 12/29 she noticed the onset of muscle pains throughout her body but especially in her feet. She also became very fatigued. These symptoms linger on 12/30. On 1/1 employee reports symptoms muscle soreness had resolved. 1/4 tingling in her fingers/arm has improved but is still present. She will follow-up with her PCP if this symptom persists beyond 2-4 weeks.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; not able to breathe or talk; Her throat was closing up; This is a spontaneous report from contactable pharmacists and an other hcp and a nurse. A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EN5318) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 15:15 in right deltoid at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included high blood pressure medication. Patient was not able to breathe or talk. Her throat was closing up. They had to use epinephrine to help her breath. It was reported as anaphylactic reaction. The vaccine was administered at 15:15, patient was interacting with HCPs who asked basic questions and at some point (15:17) patient was not responsive, patient was not able to breath and talk. All events started from 25Jan2021 15:17. Patient was administered Epipen (also reported as Benadryl and Epinephrine) and &#34;she came back&#34;. Patient was taken to hospital. Patient refused to call an ambulance. She was taken to hospital. The patient was not seen in the Emergency Department. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. Unknown if covid tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient has not received any other vaccines around the time of bnt162b2 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included heart rate with result of went up as soon as epipen was administered, O2 saturation and vitals with unknown results, all on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Two days after the 2nd injection I started to have chest pain and not feel right. I went to the Station where I volunteer. I did and EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I went to the ER. They gave me 4 baby aspirin to take and some blood work. I was told the blood work showed elevated levels consistent with a blood clot as well. I had a CT scan to rule out a clot in my heart or lungs. Which it was negative. I was released and told to see a cardiologist in the next few days. I saw the cardiologist two days later who said I ended up with Pericarditis and that it should resolve on its own. I was feeling better until two days ago when I developed chest pain again. I again went to my fire station I volunteer for and did an EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I am currently waiting for treatment from my cardiologist.

                                                DVT; PE; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 42-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscularly in the left arm, on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 42-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN) and fibroids. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscularly in the right arm, on 07Jan2021 (at the age of 42-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) on 29Jan2021, which caused hospitalization for 5 days from an unspecified date to an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). The clinical outcome of DVT and PE was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 or comirnarty in triggering the onset of Deepvein thrombosis,pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.But also consider relevant medical history of hypertension and fibroids tendency to form blood clots and concomitant medications also have possible contributory role. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took another dose of benadryl mid day. By evening I was in anaphylaxis with swollen lips and itchy gums. Went to the ER and received ephnephrine, intravenous benadryl, pepcid and prednisone. Was monitored for 3 hours, swelling was gone and symptoms had subsided. Went home. Next morning  symptoms were less but feet were tender to walk on and hands and feet were itchy. Picked up prescrription prednisone and loratadine and took both that morning. By evening afternoon was very itchy and hives on back, legs, arms and neck took benadryl that evening which helped but currently itchy red hives on arms, hands, neck, legs and feet - all over body. A new symptom is very swollen lymph nodes in neck.

A 42-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 19Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3249) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included post-partum hypothyroidism. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 29Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient stated &#34;The day after second vaccine and that week, I had chills, aches, fever 101, left neck and chest swollen lymph nodes, stomach aches. 28Jan2021, I started having severe left flank pain and abdominal pain. On 04Feb2021, I had a heart attack, was in V-fib arrest, and subsequently found to have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which caused 3 artery dissections and narrowing of other arteries. Did not know I had FMD prior to the heart attack. Most people who have FMD never show signs or symptoms and don&#39;t know they have it. Others with FMD have it affect maybe one artery. Something caused my FMD to go into overdrive, affecting 3 arteries. It also affected a renal artery, causing lack of blood to my left kidney, causing part of that kidney to die - that was my 28Jan2021 pain. Coincidental my FMD acted up this way a little over a week after receiving the second Pfizer shot?&#34; Events were reported as serious and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient hospitalization for 9 days. Treatment received for all events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test (Nasal Swab): negative on an unknown date (Covid test post vaccination). The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 42-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 02Apr2021 11:00, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation, at a pharmacy/drug store. Medical history included esophageal dysmotility, thyroid nodules, ACL tear and ACL repair on 15Apr2021. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO); and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported.

Patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. Patient has been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: Negative and Pixel: Negative on 08Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events including stroke, dizzy/lightheaded/felt like fainting, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and sudden loss of hearing to right, and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the patient&#39;s underlying medical conditions, relevant lab tests would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

                                                I was approximately 4 weeks pregnant at the time that I received dose #1 (12/23/20)- I was unaware of the pregnancy. I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

The spotting continued (very light) until 9:00pm.  I decided to go to bed since I wasn&#39;t feeling well.  I woke at 2:00am with contractions and heavy bleeding.  I went to the ED at 3:00am on 1/30 to confirm my miscarriage.  I weighed 121 at the ED when triaged. My EDD was 08/19/2021

                                                I didn?t notice any symptoms right away.  When they started, I didn?t think it was abnormal at first. I am female and still have my menstrual cycle. This time it appeared to be heavier than usual and had some blood clots. However, before I was on birth control it was always that way. Sometimes it is a little heavier when I have more stress or the weather is not ideal. My cycle started around 2/4/21. On 2/8/21, I combed my one cat. She scratched and bit me and has done so in the past. She and I both are vaccinated and I?ve never developed any infections because of it in the past. On 2/10/21, I noticed a cluster of red pinpoint dots underneath my skin on my arms and chest. They weren?t bumpy, warm to the touch, itchy or anything. It just looked odd and I didn?t know how it happened. I work with a Nurse Practitioner and she suggested I go into to a clinic as those usually indicate an infection is developing. I went to the Urgent Care and was treated.  He did blood work on me and informed me that my glucose was a little low.  It was suppertime so that didn?t surprise me.  He told me there was no signs of infection in my blood work but was prescribing two antibiotics in case one developed. When I was getting my meds at the pharmacy, a call was coming through that I didn?t recognize so do to phone scams, I didn?t answer it. I started the antibiotics. Then over the course of 2/13/21 and 2/14/21 weekend days, I felt more fatigued than usual, nauseated, had a decreased appetite and still had my menstrual cycle. I still didn?t think much about it as a side effect of the antibiotics was nausea and decreased appetite and the fatigue could be related to it being so cold and winter usually affects my depression symptoms. Then on 2/14/21 I noticed my lower abdomen was covered in those red, pinpoint blood dot clusters and there were unexplained bruises on my body. I took a shower and when I went to wash my legs, my pelvic area was completely bloody and a blood clot dropped into the bathtub. Never has that occurred when I have my period. It looked like I had just given birth it was so much blood. I became nauseated and dry heaved several times. On 2/15/21, I sent a message to Dr asking what was happening to me. He called me and informed me that he had tried to call me the night he saw me because he saw my platelet count was only 11,000 and should be a minimum of 140,000. Dr asked that I return to Urgent Care as soon as possible.  I arrived there around 12:30 pm that day. He had bloodwork done again on me. My platelets went down to 9,000. I explained that my menstrual cycle would not stop and it should?ve but I just keep bleeding. Dr contacted a Hematologist that informed him that recently the blood disorder Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been linked with the COVID19 vaccination in rare cases. I was scheduled to be seen by a Hematologist and put on the medication prednisone to build up my platelet count. I returned to Urgent Care for blood work again on 2/16/21.  My platelets went up to 30,000. I met with Hematology on 2/17/21 and had blood work again, platelets 28,000. All providers looked over my medical record and noted that since my gastric bypass surgery in 2015, my health has been good, my blood work has been normal and I live a clean lifestyle. Again, the only issue showing up in my bloodwork was that my platelets were extremely low. Now I have weekly blood draws, take 80 mg of prednisone and have a Hematologist when just a few weeks ago my health was good.

The joints that do normally hurt were way worse (my back, and right big toe joint).

                                                On 2/20/21  when I woke up I went to use the restroom. When I wiped I noticed that I was spotting on the tissue. This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

A 43-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 06:30 (at the age of 43-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 (with taste and smell loss). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 17Dec2020 at 14:00 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and experienced head to toe itching and progress with taste and smell disappeared/worse than COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylactic reaction on 16Jan2021 at 20:00 and itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss on an unspecified date. The patient reported that all the progress she made with taste and smell, disappeared after the vaccine and was actually worse than when she got COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild anaphylactic reaction, which included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The clinical outcome of mild anaphylactic reaction was not recovered and of itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

                                                Starting on February 24, 2021, I started to have shortness of breath. This slowly got worse until on March 2, 2021 I was unable to breathe in all the way and was getting a sharp pain in my side/back when I tried to breathe in more than half way. I then went to the emergency room recognizing the symptom as likely being a pulmonary embolism, as I had experienced one four years earlier. It was, in fact, a PE. I was in the hospital for five days as they treated the clots with blood thinners. I slowly got my breathing more back to normal and was discharged. They are still runnying myriad tests to try to determine the cause or causes, but I thought it wise to report here in case the vaccine is a factor. I received my second dose on 2/26/21, a few days before I went to the hospital but my symptoms started a few days before that.

                                                Pfizer dose 1 - left arm hurt for 3 days - used ice pack and Advil to ease Pfizer dose 2 - started bleeding upon receiving the vaccine. Left arm again hurt the evening of the shot.  Next morning I was in a lot of pain and my arm had a red ring and lump. Very tender.  I also had a mild headache which turned into a migraine in the evening.   Third day after vaccine my arm still hurts and the red ring has grown in size and mildly itches.  (As I type I am in day 3).

Immediately following the statement I was having difficulties speaking, slurred speech, and my body felt weighted. This lasted 2 minutes. This experience happened two more times so we left for the ER. Another episode happened while checking in the ER and they responded as if I was having a stroke. A 5th episode happened while in the ER waiting for a room and a 6th time after admission in the room with a nurse. This last episode was at 1:00pm on 3/5/2021. I could feel each of these coming on.

The day that I got the shot coincided with the day that I got my period, so I was already menstruating when the clots passed from my body. The clots were much larger than normal, and much more frequent. I passed almost a half dozen large clots. By the third day, my menstruation flow started to subside (the first two days tend to be heavier days for me). I did not pass any large clots on the third day going forward.

I have a history of painful periods but after an endometrial ablation over 10 years ago I have had normal pain. The period after the vaccine was incredibly painful and the consistency of the discharge was completely different. Pale pink clots that almost looked like uterine lining instead of clots I&#39;m used to seeing.  I want to report this because I&#39;ve talked to other women who&#39;ve had something similar but I didn&#39;t see anything about it on the CDC website.

A 43-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm in the morning of 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing complex regional pain syndrome, ongoing fibromyalgia, ongoing arthritis - all diagnosed 20 years ago. Her mother has lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and she can&#39;t have the vaccine, states she doesn&#39;t know if something could be genetic. Low potassium in the past and stated that she has a lot of allergies to medications, but she consulted with the pharmacist and he said it would be okay. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccine was administered on the same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient was having weird symptoms and she tried looking online and in different groups to find out if anyone has similar symptoms, but she hasn&#39;t been able to find anything. She began by saying she has health issues; she has Fibromyalgia and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. She doesn&#39;t know if studies were performed on patients with those disorders that took the vaccine. It&#39;s been about 3 weeks since getting the vaccine (Apr2021) and she started having symptoms that she thought could be a blood clot. From the knees down, she was having a lot of pain, cramps, burning from her calf to her feet. She would keep rubbing them and massaging them. It was excruciating pain. She was having symptoms and she did go see her Nurse Practitioner on 14Apr2021 because she thought she was having a stroke or a clot or something in her legs or that she was having a problem with her cholesterol. The nurse thought maybe it was her electrolytes, because she had low potassium in the past, but everything came back normal. Her feet were painful but not as bad in Apr2021. She felt like her condition but it&#39;s flaring up like 200% it&#39;s like over a 10 on the pain scale. She can&#39;t think right, she can&#39;t work, and was very uncomfortable in Apr2021. The leg pain felt like it is really deep in the vein, it doesn&#39;t feel like it is superficial, and she can feel stuff or liquid flowing. Her pain alternates from her head to her neck to her feet and it is very uncomfortable. Her hands and feet started to go numb, not completely numb but like when they fall asleep from sitting on them and then hit something and it hurts. Her arms were burning like crazy; they itch, they burn in Apr2021. Different temperatures like hot and cold make it painful, bad and irritating, and she can&#39;t sleep well because of her symptoms. She doesn&#39;t know the exact dates, but it has been about a week, but it is changing. It started with cramps in her legs from her knees down. That is where she had injuries and she thought it was her cholesterol. From her knees down, she has cramps and pain and it is very uncomfortable, she felt a really deep pain. She has pain in her neck then to her back, it started in her lower extremities and it is going up. It has stayed the same and she has to keep taking Tylenol to control the pain. Her symptoms got worse and she started taking Tylenol and that helped and then on 15Apr2021, her hands and feet started going numb and she had a headache and pain on the top portion of her head (reported as brain) and her hands hurt, and she was nauseous. She hasn&#39;t heard back from the nurse practitioner, so she decided not to go and get it done because she felt it is from the vaccine. She also has swelling of feet in Apr2021, and now she just woke up an hour ago and she slept somewhat okay, but she had to take Tylenol. Now that she is standing, it felt like her legs are starting to hurt again. Treatment included Tylenol, which helps a little and she has to keep taking it. If she doesn&#39;t take Tylenol, she can&#39;t even function. The events from the knees down I was having a lot pain/leg pain felt like it is really deep in the vein, cramps, my hands and feet started going numb, they itch they burn, feet are painful, uncomfortable, pain on the top of my head and my hands hurt/headache, swelling in her feet, nauseous, pain in her neck then to her back, different temperatures like hot and cold make it bad and irritating had not resolved, while the event can&#39;t sleep well because of her symptoms was resolving, and the outcome rest of the events was unknown.

A week after #2 my menstrual cycles (which have been clockwork all of my life-I have 4 children and track it monthly)  became much more frequent and heavy with excessive clotting. I thought perhaps I was going though early menopause (44) but then realized correlation with vaccine. My mood changed, I feel sad all of the time, I am dreading recommendation of additional shots.

                                                Received the Pfizer 2nd dose on 9th April. Following day (04/10), I had body ache, fatigue, mild temperature 99.8, back neck and upper arm/shoulder pain. While I recovered from the ache and fatigue the next day (04/11), the neck pain continued for a couple of weeks. On 23rd April, the pain aggravated and I took a 2 Advil&#39;s (2 tablets of 200mg each) which made the overall pain extremely critical. The pain was mainly in the neck, upper arm, tingling in the fingers, grinding jaw pain, all symptomatic to a cardiac pain.  I visited the Urgent care and they suggested I rush to Emergency care. See the notes attached. I was detected with Myocardial infraction or Heart Inflammation (as there was an increasing Troponin). They did an Angiogram to detect any blockages but was cleared of all blockages or major heart conditions. Was hospitalized for 2 days and was on observation for any new pains, repeat or increase in symptoms. Heart inflammation continues to be there and I am unable to take any anti inflammatory as that aggravates the cardiac/ MI pain. No prior history of heart disease etc. Will be visiting for repeat tests with the Cardiologist in coming weeks. Since there were no prior heart condition and since this initiated day after the 2nd vaccine, i strongly believe this is a side effect from the vaccine dose.

                                                Started with the right arm turning purple or changing colors when elevated above the head.   This continued for a few weeks.  Then  I started to get a tingling sensation in the elbow that went into the right pinky.  I visited my primary doctor to see what was going on.  She did an evaluation, prescribed Ibuprofen and physical therapy, and had a cervical spine x-ray done.  The X-ray looked great when it came back.  I could not get an appointment with PT for several weeks so I finally went to the chiropractor on 5/13.  He worked on the shoulder area stretching it out.   By the morning of 5/15 I was being taken to urgent care and eventually the ER because the arm was swelling and fingers were turning blue.  They did blood tests, EKG, chest x-ray, and finally an ultrasound that showed a blood clot.  It was DVT in the subclavian vein.  I was given a blood thinner and sent home.  I had a more thorough ultrasound on 5/17 that sent me back to the ER and with vascular surgeons to discuss immediate surgery with lysis therapy.  It was decided that the blood clot had probably been there for weeks and the success rate of the surgery would not be as good.

About a week later, i was short of breath. I called my asthma dr who ordered steroids. That did not make a difference. I never really got better. I figured the vaccine triggered my asthma. In march, I felt like i was going to pass out as I was walking into work. I went to work and was short of breath the whole night I called my doctor, I kept taking albuterol and steroid thinking it was asthma related .I worked that Sunday and went to the Dr on Wednesday who sent me to the hospital. I&#39;ve been on anti coagulants since then. They thought it was a female cancer, or clotting problem. I have never taken birth control in my life so i had no participating factors. There are a few labs that cannot be done until after I am off of anticoagulants. These clots are completely unexplained and I have changed nothing aside from receiving the COVID vaccine.

After 2nd vaccine dose on 01/16/2021 developed fever, chills, weakness, fatigue, body aches approximately 10 hours after received the 2nd dose. This all lasted about 24 hours. Then on 01/19/2021 which was the 2nd day of mine menstrual cycle, I had a very abnormal menstruation. I was passing &#34;fist&#34; size blood clots  which made me very weak. this lasted again about 24 hours then it stopped. I had some labs drawn on 02/27/2021 which came back with very low Iron, Hematocrit and Hemoglobin levels.  I usually do show signs of anemia in previous blood work but this time the levels dropped lower so i was referred to see a Hematologist.

                                                nausea; vomiting; chest pain; myocarditis; thrombocytopenia; This is a Literature-spontaneous report 2021, 1-4; entitled Thrombocytopenia following Pfizer and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A 44-year-old woman was hospitalized for nausea, vomiting and chest pain on the day that she received the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162B2) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number unknown) at single dose (at 44-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Her laboratory values included a platelet count of 85 x 109/L and a peak troponin level of 4 ng/mL (normal &lt; = 0.04 ng/mL). The patient was diagnosed with myocarditis but did not require treatment for thrombocytopenia. Her platelets were 61 x 109/L on discharge, but subsequent platelet counts were not reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information on Lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal association cannot be excluded between the reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine use. The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for AE. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, ethics committees and investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 4 hours after the first vaccine, numbness and tingling all over the body. Left arm went completely numb and tingling. Scalp tingling and numb. Felt like circulation was cut off. Severe Shortness of breath. Extreme feeling of adrenaline. The next day on March 14th, had extreme vaginal bleeding on day 14 of cycle. Bled for another 7 days which led to extreme anemia. The shortness of breath is every day since the first dose. Heart palpitations (heart rate went up to 190!). After the second dose on 4/03, all symptoms got worst. Left leg went completely numb the same day which I went to the emergency room for. The neurological tingling and numbness was spreading to my whole body. Arms, legs, face, ears, scalp, inside my head. I was worried for a heart attack since all of my symptoms of left arm and shoulder pain and numbness etc. I was released from the emergency room 12 hours later. I continued to have severe symptoms. The shortness of breath was so bad that I didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights straight because my oxygen would drop. I also had severe insomnia and no appetite and lost 5 pounds in 1 week. Major adrenaline feeling. I went back to the emergency room 2 more times this week to check out my heart and lungs. All of my doctors recommended ER since they couldn&#39;t help me. My neurologist said he is getting lots of these symptoms from people post vaccine.  My shortness of breath and elevated heart rate and numbness and tingling are still here and I can barely go up and down stairs without being out of breath and having a 130-140 heart rate and super low blood pressure and night sweats. It is awful.

I had this for about a week and then the swelling went down. A few days later, I had redness, skin was warm to touch, and hardness developing where the red spot was. I went to urgent care and the NP sent me to the ER for a possible blood clot. I had a venous study done in the ER and it was determined I had a superficial blood clot and was started on ASA 325 mg daily x7 days. I followed up with a vascular doctor and it was determined the clot was worse and had clotted all the way up the vein into my thigh. It remains superficial in nature at this time. I was started on Xarelto 10 mg  daily x1 month. I follow up with vascular in 1 month to make sure the clot is dissolving. I was instructed to Follow up with either the doc or go to the ER with worsening symptoms.

The Head nurse sent me to the Urgent care. During the  exam I developed tightness in chest and throat started to swell. Doctor determined it was a delayed  analphylactic reaction to the COVID vaccine. It was delayed due to taking the Allegra the previous day.  He treated me with a benedryl shot and famotidine and prednisone in pill form. Observed for 1 hour  and allowed to go home. As of April 5, 2021, still experiencing tightness in chest. Swelling in face has reduced

Then on  4/18 started to notice pain and swelling in volar surface of the ipsilateral forearm - unclear at time if it was related Was then evaluated in the office, noted to have palpable mass in volar aspect of ipsilateral forearm. duplex ultrasound showed possible mass but no clot.  Follow-up ultarsound showed possbile AVM and finally MRI showed no etiology to explain the mass. repeat ultrasound described it as vascular) HIT antibody was weak positive (at 0.4) In the interim, multiple d-dimer tests were normal, but one drawn simultaneously was elevated (possible specimen issue), and there was also an transient thrombocytopenia which we understand has completely resolved. Currently, hematology &#43; allergist referrals are pending.

                                                pt received 1st pfizer covid shot at 3:47 pm. she told me she had a history of anaphylaxis to oral benadryl and i counseled her that she should wait 30 minutes for observation after the immunization. around 4 pm she notified my technician the outside of her throat was starting to feel hot and itchy. i took her into the room and sat her down in private. I gave her an ice pack to put on her throat and was observing her when the itching started on her abdomen. I advised her she was having an anaphylactic event and she denied me calling ambulance or using epipen. Around 4:05 pm she asked for some cream so we gave her some hydrocortisone cream OTC that she applied to itchy area on chest and throat and she said she was feeling better. Around 4:15 she told me the itching was starting inside her mouth and allowed me to call 911 and administer one dose of epinephrine 0.3 mg in her left thigh. The fire department came around 4:20 and started talking to her and taking vitals. blood pressure was 146/90 and heart rate was 100 even with the epinephrine causing her to shake. They advised she wait for emt&#39;s that arrived around 4:30 pm and they conviced her to go in the ambulence to the hospital even though she was feeling fine since there was a chance the epi would wear off and she would need more help.

A 44-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 15Apr2021 14:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER873I) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included Crohn&#39;s, HTN and ADHD.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of unprovoked DVT of right lower leg including Xarelto 15 mg bid.

I took 3 doses of benadryl to help calm the symptoms as I did not want to get stuck paying for an emergency room visit or use my EpiPen which would also result in an ER visit.  Soon after, I also  started feeling extremely  itchy all over but mainly at injection site.  My body became tingly and I had hot and cold flashes. About an hour after that, the headache, nausea and horrible body aches began. the itching at injection site stopped after 2 hours but the rest of the symptoms remained for 3 days with the exception of the headache, nausea and body aches which still remain and no amount of over the counter medication help.

A 44-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Apr2021 at 11:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0171) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date and no vaccination administered in the 4 weeks prior. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s Thyroid (diagnosed with this condition many, many years ago). There was no relevant family history.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021,  Lot Number: ER8737; in right arm. On 22Apr2021, about a half hour after the shot she states her head felt weird, she couldn&#39;t swallow, she felt cold, and she could not breathe right. On 23Apr2021, she was driving her husband and blacked out.  Her tongue also began to swell.  She just happened to be by the exit ramp to the hospital. She visited the Emergency Room. They told her she was having a delayed anaphylactic reaction. No relevant tests were performed according to the reporter. All of her symptoms recovered when she started prednisone on 23Apr2021. She was prescribed prednisone, taper dose with last dose 27Apr2021. She still remained with lightheadedness and still could not drive.  The only one persisting was the weird feeling in her head, almost like a lightheaded feeling. She could not drive due to this symptom There was no physician office visit for the events. The events delayed anaphylactic reaction, blacked out, tongue swelled, couldn&#39;t swallow, couldn&#39;t breathe right, and feeling cold were resolved on 23Apr2021. The lightheadedness and head felt weird were ongoing (not recovered).

( still bleeding lightly as of today 5/16/2021 ). Not sure if it is related to the vaccine but this has never happened to me before.

                                                ITP - platelets of 3; severe thrombocytpenia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 44-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Apr2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 44-year-old. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) - platelets of 3 and severe thrombocytpenia, both on 30Apr2021. The events were reported as serious with seriousness criteria of hospitalization (from an unspecified date in 2021). The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included platelet count: severe thrombocytpenia/ITP - platelets of 3 on 30Apr2021, Nasal Swab: negative on 30Apr2021. Treatment received for the events that included intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), IV steroids. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and severe thrombocytopenia and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded.  There is limited information available, thus precluding further assessment. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The shortness of breath didn&#39;t subside so went in to see the NP at my family doctors office. She had me go get some blood work and chest x-ray. My d-dimer was over 2000 so she sent me to the ER where they did a CT Scan and found blood clots in my lungs. They then admitted me for the night on a heparin drip and then discharged me with Eliquis blood thinners. Meeting with my family doctor next week for more information.

A 44-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left upper on 07Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8735) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization, at the age at vaccination of 44 years old.   Medical history included coronary artery disease, Microvascular disease, migraine, Bypass of LAD artery with my LIMA artery, angioplasty, had open heart surgery before, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Historical vaccine included first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 10Mar2021 at the age at vaccination of 43 years old (got the first shot in right upper arm) for covid-19 immunization.  Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (PLAVIX); lisinopril; amlodipine; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR); fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC); clonazepam (KLONOPIN), Nexletol (further clarification unknown). The patient experienced anytime i exerted myself it get worse so i went to the hospital and they admitted me because they couldn&#39;t control my angina on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, bypass had developed a huge blood clot on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, chest pain on 19Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, nose bleed on 08Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on unknown date, light headedness/light headed and dizzy on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, hematoma on her arm a couple of days later after that she got it was swollen, bruises she got nose bleed (hematoma) on Apr2021 with outcome of recovered on 19Apr2021, hematoma on her arm a couple of days later after that she got it was swollen, bruises she got nose bleed (Bruising of arm) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hematoma on her arm a couple of days later after that she got it was swollen, bruises she got nose bleed (Swelling arm) on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, my arm hurt on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests which included lipids: unknown (had lipid channel), something checking for heart stress: unknown, both on unknown date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of angina attack, chest pain, nose bleed, hematoma, Bruising of arm, Swelling arm and Pain in arm.  Seriousness for events &#34;anytime i exerted myself it get worse so i went to the hospital and they admitted me because they couldn&#39;t control my angina&#34; and &#34;bypass had developed a huge blood clot&#34; was hospitalization, medically significant. The patient was hospitalized for both events from 20Apr2021 to 23Apr2021. Events chest pain, Light headedness/light headed and dizzy resulted in Emergency Room Visit.  Additional information: Transferring agent stated, &#34;I have patient on the line today and the reason for my transfer today is that she is having adverse effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine, she did clarify it is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and she is experiencing hematoma on her arm a couple of days later after that it was swollen, bruises she got nose bleed as well and on 19th April that she was experiencing chest pain she went to ER and they were thinking it was cause of the COVID Vaccine as well.&#34; Consumer stated, &#34;On 07Apr2021, I have the LOT number and everything of the vaccine I received for both of them on 07Apr2021, I got the Pfizer the second Pfizer shot and I developed a hematoma on my arm which was as big as a baseball. It was really swollen and I take blood thinners and on the next day on 04-08, I started getting a lot of nose bleed. I never get a nose bleed and so I called my doctors and asked what should I do and she said stop taking your blood thinners so I stopped taking the blood thinners and then may be after 7 days, I started taking my blood thinners again. So, it took about 3 weeks for the hematoma to go away on 04-19th, I had a huge chest pain, I have had open heart surgery before and I had to go to the ER because I felt light headed and dizzy. My arm hurt, my chest, I took nitroglycerine (treatment) and it made still little better but anytime I exerted myself it gets worse so I went to the hospital and they admitted me because they couldn&#39;t control my angina and my cardiologist did an angioplasty (Further clarification unknown) and he found that my 2019, I had a bypass of LAD artery with my LIMA artery (Medical History) and he found that my bypass had developed a huge blood clot and failed. So, basically I am looking at go in and having another bypass using my LIMA artery but the surgeon, the coronary surgeon that I talking he wanted me to call Pfizer to let you guys know because he said that that is so weird that it failed and the shot and everything and he just wanted you guys to be aware and you know that&#39;s what we wanted safety because I know that when I went in I had a lot of a questions and none of my doctor could answer. It says I shouldn&#39;t take it if I am on blood thinners but they said it is still better than you getting COVID so I went ahead and took the shot but actually now I have to get a bypass again. It might be from the vaccine, it might not be from the vaccine but the timings is just you close together there.&#34; Patient took Nitroglycerin, she was on now but that&#39;s because of the chest pain so that was on before she had the chest pain when she had the shot (Further not clarified). When probed of the event is still ongoing: Consumer stated, &#34;Yes, because my By pass graph is now failed.&#34; Treatment: Patient took Tranexa (name not clarified). It was a medicine for her chest pain. Outcome: Consumer stated, &#34;As in nose bleed and bleeding are gone, now it is just chest pain&#34;.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

It was unknown whether the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient received her usual home medications (unspecified) within 2 weeks of vaccination. On 28May2021, the patient was presented to hospital after 1 week of right lower extremity swelling and shortness of breath found to have R sided pulmonary emboli. The seriousness of all the events was reported as serious (hospitalization/Prolonged hospitalization). The reporting physician stated that it was unclear regarding the relatedness between second dose of vaccine and the events, but the patient does not have any other known history to provoke DVT/PE. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 Test: Negative (Nasal swab) on 28May2021. Since the vaccination, the patient tested for COVID-19. The device (unspecified) date was reported as 29May2021. The patient received anticoagulation as treatment for pulmonary embolism. The outcome of all the events was reported as unknown.  Information about batch no/lot no has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, dyspnoea  and peripheral swelling cannot be totally excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                On June 8, 2021 I noticed right shoulder/arm pain. Went to my dr on 6/9 and he ordered a port dye study (I have a Bard Power Port for iron infusions that ended in February). The port was fine, everything flowing correctly.  On 6/10, my right arm was swollen and discolored. My Dr told me to go to ER.  A CT scan was  done and  showed 2 DVTs and 1 PE. I was admitted and started on IV heparin. I was on the IV heparin until 6/13 and then was switched to oral Eloquis 10mg twice daily. It is now 6/14, and I should be discharged sometime today. I will continue to be on Eloquis for 3 - 6 months.

Because I had had a surgery 5 weeks before the thought of blood clots was on my mind, I began stretches and walking but it seemed to make it worse. That leg swelled and started to change color, it was my left leg, I went to ER they prescribed Xarelto, I was told I had clotting from my side to my ankle and circulation restriction. Bloodwork showed positive results for blood clots.  I still have some pain and swelling. I did walk with a limp for a couple weeks. Treatments with Xarelto will continue for 3 more months. I had a follow up at trilakes primary on 06/08/2021. She confirmed it was blood clots and said she believes it was vaccine related.

                                                vaginal bleeding; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) via Medical information team. A 45-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient have family history of diabetes mellitus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Vitamin B12 [cyanocobalamin] and experienced allergy rash and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism for more than a year. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 08Jan2021 at 11:20 or 11:25AM and at around 3 PM, she had noticed some vaginal bleeding. She thought it was her period but it stopped during the night (she mentioned she worked that night). She asked if this was a side effect from the vaccine. It was light, like when a person&#39;s period was coming but it was a brownish color, not red. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No treatment given to the patient for the event. The outcome of the event was recovered on 08Jan2021.

                                                In discussion with Dr., medical director at Detox, she  arrived night of 2/3/21 was quite intoxicated so was not going through any  withdrawal.  She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

I quickly took 2 chewable (12.5mg each) benadryl tablets. after about 5 min. i felt stable enough to leave. on the way home I started to  feel the itching intensify and I felt very warm. I had welts forming and hives appeared all over. As I pulled into my driveway( 7 min drive from vaccination site) I felt my lips and eyelids swell, and my throat felt tingly. I took another 2 chewable benadryls. (12.5mg each). I immediately called my Doctor and explained what was going on. I also started to wheeze. I used my inhaler.  He told me to use my epipen. Which I already had prepared since I knew this was anaphylaxis. I started to feel stable enough to go inside. I called my husband to come downstairs to be with me. I still wasnt feeling well and the tightness and wheezing persisted. At around  8:40, My dr. told me to use the 2nd Epipen and use my nebulaizer.  If I wasn&#39;t better in 10 minutes he would call an ambulance. Thank GD the itching and hives subsided and the wheezing and tightness diminished by aroung 8:50am. My dr. comtinued to monitor me and check up on me. By 3pm I was back to myself.

I went to the ER, and they discovered two blood clots in my lungs.  I&#39;ve never had pulmonary embolisms before, so this is a very strange coincidence.  I am in cancer treatment, so my risk of PEs is higher, but the timing is too close for me not to think that the second vaccine traumatized my immune system, causing the PEs.

A 45-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 15Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the first dose on 29Dec2020 in the left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in four weeks. Medical history included allergies: Sulfa. Patient was not pregnant at the time of report. The patient has not had COVID prior vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (SEASONIQUE) taken for birth control. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis in right calf on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. The event deep vein thrombosis in right calf resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received aspirin regimen as treatment for the event deep vein thrombosis in right calf.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, the event deep vein thrombosis most likely represents an intercurrent medical condition and was unrelated to Bnt162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of concomitant drug ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel to the event can not be totally excluded. Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Went to doctor on 3/3 due to severe pain.  No thoughts of what it could be. Continued headaches with no relief.  Received migraine shots in hip on night of 3/11. Severe stroke on 3/13.  Should not be at risk for a stroke and does not have any typical factors for being at risk. Has been in hospital and in-patient rehab since.  Has a fully occluded clot in her right ICA.

Due to fibroids, this caused excessive bleeding leading to anemic condition and the need for several blood and iron transfusions.  Solution was to perform hysterectomy to eliminate fibroids and bleeding to be able to continue use of blood thinners for blood clot condition.

                                                15 minutes after the injection I had an intense allergic/anaphylactic reaction.  I was watched and treated on site by EMS for 2 hours with Benadryl, oxygen and rest.  We did not use epi because I was still able to breath (minus some wheezing, coughing, hoarseness and lung irritation).  I felt the reaction hit when I started seeing green spots and my vitals dramatically increased (BP 181/111, HR 142 and weak).  I then experienced the following symptoms: rash/hives on neck and chest, fatigue and weakness, dizzy and lightheaded and needed wheelchair for moving around, chills and shaking, blurry vision, nausea, stomach pain, headache, chest pain and increased urination.  I also had elevated glucose (147).  During those two hours my vitals decreased a little, but the rest of my symptoms persisted.  I was not getting better and my vitals started to increase again at the two hour mark so EMS called an ambulance and transported me to hospital.  I was treated with solumedrol and observed for several hours.  The meds helped enough to send me home.  (I did have to continue taking Benadryl at home that night and the next day because I continued to have an allergic response). I also had severe injection site pain and bruising.

A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Mar2021 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Within 5 hours after receiving the dose, she developed shingles on 23Mar2021. She stated the pain was so bad she thought she was having a heart attack on an unspecified date in 2021. Her medical doctor (MD) told her that she should get the second dose of the vaccine and that the shingles was dormant in her system and because her &#34;immune system was low&#34; she developed the shingles outbreak. The patient further stated that she developed shingles 4 hours later after receiving the first dose. She stated that the eruptions have stopped but it was still painful. She was asking if she should get the second covax or wait. The patient had not yet recovered from shingles while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I was having my menstrual cycle when I got my second vaccine. Approximately 24 hours after receiving my second COVID vaccine, my bleeding became very heavy and I passed a large amount of clots. This lasted approximately 8 hours then stopped. Previous periods have been light, as I had a tubal ligation and ablation several years ago. After this incident, I did not have a period for 2 months. My cycle has since resumed.

A 45-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm, on 19Mar2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7534) as a single dose (at the age for 45-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma and allergies.  The patient did not receive other vaccines in the 4 weeks prior. She received an unspecified concomitant medication for allergy in the two weeks prior. The patient had not experienced COVID prior to vaccination. On22Mar2021, chills and headache started. On 23Mar2021, chills and headache continued and the patient experienced 102 fever with a little cough. She went to the Urgent Care and they diagnosed it as a side effect of the vaccine. On 01Apr2021, the coughing got worse and it turned into pneumonia. On 10Apr2021, she was admitted to the ER for over 103F fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. &#34;Low immune from pneumonia developed or flared up the Valley Fever.&#34;  The events were treated with steroid shot, antibiotic IVs, fluid IV, and more. The patient was COVID-tested post vaccination with Rapid COVID test (nasal swab) on 25Mar2021 with Negative result, and with PCR test (nasal swab) on 10Apr2021 with negative result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 45-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Jan2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took aspirin (e.c.) and developed allergies (known allergies Aspirin and related products), first dose of bnt162b2 in left arm on 29Dec2020 for covid-19 immunization. The patient developed an ITP (immune thrombocytopenia) flare after receiving vaccine and her blood platelets dropped to as low as 7000 on 22Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included platelet count: platelets dropped to as low as 7000 on 22Feb2021, nasal swab: negative on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Steroids) were taken as a result of events. No other vaccine in four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No covid prior vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The outcome of events was resolving.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

THE HEADACHES CONTINUED ON AND OFF FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL ON 5/24/2021 AT 3 PM, SHE HAD A DEBILITATING HEADACHE WITH DIZZINESS THAT COULD NOT BE RELIEVED. THEN ON THE AFTERNOON OF 5/25/2021, SHE STARTED EXPERIENCING VISUAL CHANGES WITH BLACK SPOTS IN HER VISION. SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE HER DOCTOR ON 5/27/2021 AT 10 AM. HE SENT HER FOR A CT SCAN OF HER HEAD WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A MRI OF HER BRAIN. THE MRI AND CT SCAN REVEALED THAT SHE HAD A LEFT FRONTAL ISCHEMIC STROKE. SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL ON 5/27 AND DISCHARGED HOME ON THE AFTERNOON OF 5/28. SHE HAD A CT ANGIOGRAM OF THE BRAIN, AN ECHO OF THE HEART, ULTRASOUND OF THE CAROTIDS AND A HYPERCOAGULATION BLOOD PANEL. ALL OF WHICH WERE NORMAL AND SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF WHERE THE BLOOD CLOTS CAME FROM THAT CAUSED HER STROKE.  SHE CONTINUES TO HAVE HEADACHES WITH DIZZINESS, FATIGUE, AND NOW BAD ANXIETY.

                                                During our event today, here at the  Church in coordination with the Cleaning Services monthly training event, a patient had an anaphylactic reaction to the COVID vaccine.  Anaphylaxis:   45yoF w/ h/o Rheumatoid arthritis and Wegener?s granulomatosis who takes immunosuppressive infusion 2x/yr, most recently in April, no h/o anxiety, and h/o COVID x2 (4/2020 &amp; 10/2020), experienced an anaphylactic reaction, with symptom onset beginning within 1 min of us administering a 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine.   Sx: throat clearing, cough, chest tightness, diaphoresis  PEx:  Alert throughout Hand over chest/ lower throat Shortness of breath  Voice hoarse, speaking in 1-2 word sentence fragments  Timeline:  10:35 - administered  10:36 - throat clearing  10:37 - advising pt to sign up for V-safe given her underlying autoimmune dz  10:38 - intermittent coughs 10:41 - drawing up epi  10:45 - Epi 0.5ml (1mg/ml) administered IM 10:46 - Called 911 for EMS  10:50 - Epi 0.5ml (1mg/ml) administered IM 10:55 - Diphenhydramine 50mg IM  10:57 - Pt notes throat feels more released from prior tightness 11:01 - EMS arrived, began evaluating patient  11:25 - Patient walked out to car, sister drove her home.   Advised sister for her or their dad (at home) to stay with/watch the patient for at least the next 3 hours, to be sure angioedema does not worsen; I?m happy to giver pt her 2nd dose on the return date, but recommend if she gets it, best to get while in a hospital setting; to discuss whether or not to get 2nd dose with her Rheumatologist, especially given her prior COVID illnesses x2, making this her immune system?s 3rd exposure; consider getting Epi pen to carry with her for future.    Following up with pt to advise her against getting an mRNA vaccine in the future, that currently the only other option in the U.S. is the Janssen/J&amp;J vaccine, and that given her autoimmune disease, I would be concerned about her developing immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, so recommend she discuss with her rheumatologist, and that if she gets a subsequent dose of any COVID vaccine, to have it administered at a hospital location.

Ongoing dizziness and vertigo. Possible intracranial hypertension. I am being tested next week. These symptoms have been ongoing and have not been relieved. I was given Eliquis for the blood clot, which I no longer take. I take Trokendi 100 mg daily which is being increased for the migraine. I am also suffering with chronic fatigue.

Presented to hospital on 06/08/21 after cardiac arrest, sudden collapse at home, refractory PEA with ongoing CPR &gt;4hrs, cardiogenic shock (EF20%), refractory DIC, MOSF and coma. Uncertain antecedent history, pt had tolerated vaccine well w/o untoward reactions, was possibly &#34;sick&#34; in the 2 days prior to admission 06/08, but limited history available. SARS2 PCR and resp path PCR panels negative, no clear bacterial source of shock/collapse initially identified, thus concern for primary myocarditis resulting in refractory shock (perhaps also with ischemic CVA); Tpn not c/w type I ACS/MI. Workup negative for PE, hemorrhagic stroke, PTX/tamponade, etc. 6hrs after death (in evening 06/08/21) BCx x2 resulted Grp A strep, thus pt may have had TSS at home then collapsed in PEA, however source of TSS is uncertain.  Notably patient usually healthy, active, no medications, favorable lipid panel, no illicits; &#43; EtOH binge-drinking last several months but no cirrhosis/ESLD previously doubt primarily Etoh-related process.  Pt had ongoing PEA arrests with brief ROSC for approx 7 hrs in field -&gt; ED &gt; ICU until death declared.

                                                Started getting pain in my right leg on May 1st, seen my Family Dr. on 4/29/21 clean bill of health. Pain wouldn?t go away was going to my chiropractor the whole month of May 2 times a week, for my right leg, I favored that leg never missing work, I?m a childcare provider. On 31May2021 the pain went down my leg and behind my knee just throbbing, I was walking up steps and a loud snap happens in my leg dropped me right there couldn?t move. Was taken to the ER, where they found a blood clot in my leg which caused pressure to build up on my knee which ruptured my meniscus, damaged joints, and cartilage in my knee. They put me on blood thinners, have to have surgery and can?t for 3 months I have to be off blood thinners. Can?t work and was forced to close my daycare business of 18 yrs and sell everything due to this injury. My Dr has linked it to the vaccine my blood wok showed high levels of hormones. Never ever had an issue until I got second shot. So now I?m trying to get disability, not looking good due to me being self employed. So who is gonna step up and help me financially, I was open threw the whole pandemic and this is how I go out of Business! Devastating to say the least?. My Community is shook up over this, so I took one for the team my family refuses to get the vaccine and others have decided NO after hearing my story.

                                                On 3/17/2021, I began to have a very heavy mentrual period and it was 5 days early (which never happens). On 3/22/21 I had a nose bleed at work, which also never happens. I got home from work at an RN and took off my compression stocking and had bad petechiae all over my lower extremities and scattered throughout my body. I immediately went to the Emergency Room. My labs at the ER showed my platelets were 2000! Normal platelets are over 150,000. They admitted my for thrombocytopenia and I was hospitalized for 12 nights. I was given platelets, high doses of prednisone, IVIG infusions 8 times, rituximab infusion 4 times, bone marrow biopsy which was negative, and nplate injections. Since discharge, I have been seeing the hematology team 3 times a week at facility, labs 3 times a week, rituximab infusion every friday, nplate injection once a week. I have not been able to work since 3/22/21. My diagnosis is an autoimmune response called idiopathic thrombocytopenia.

Then the next day had pain and welts at heparin injection sites as well as increased contractions.  Two days after vaccine went in for weekly fetal ultrasound and a large subamniotic hematoma [up to 7 cm in the greatest diameter] was found that was not present on ultrasound the week prior.  There was mild thrombocytopenia on testing.  Because of the hematoma providers did not want to continue anticoagulation. However due to an elevated risk of thrombosis due to a compound thrombophilia and pregnancy prolonged pregnancy without anticoagulation would also have a high risk for adverse outcomes.  The decision was made for preterm delivery at 35 weeks.  The postpartum course was complicated by postpartum hypertension.  The newborn required an intensive care unit admission due to hypoxia within the first day of life and was  found to have neonatal pneumonia.

                                                Miscarriage. Had first vaccine dose about 2 weeks after a positive home pregnancy test (on 04/24/2021). Date of last period was 03/19/2021. No fertility treatments. Spontaneous pregnancy at 46 years old. Had 2 previous miscarriages - 6 months earlier and 3 years earlier. Started bleeding and cramping 05/26/2021. Went to emergency room. They checked with ultrasound and said it was probably a miscarriage. The baby should be 9 or 10 weeks, but the ultrasound showed it was much too small for that - probably stopped developing at about 6 weeks. Pregnancy hormone levels were normal, however. Followed up with OBGYN the next day - she confirmed it looked like a miscarriage. The cramping/bleeding lasted for another week. Follow-up appointment on 06/04/2021 showed the uterus had completely emptied.

A 46-years-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0158/Batch number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 24Apr2021 (at the age of 46-years-old) as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history of the patient included hormone therapy, menopause from an unspecified date in Aug2008 (It has been 13 years since patient went through menopause in Aug2008), covid-19 from an unspecified date in Feb2021 (She had COVID She had Covid, she thinks around February. She was not tested but had antibodies. She had COVID then and then she tested positive for antibodies before getting the vaccine), hypersensitivity from an unspecified date in Feb2021 (The only time she did not feel well was with allergy symptoms, around mid Feb2021, around 15Feb2021). Concomitant medications included estradiol at a dose of two times daily (0.5pr, 30mg, one click, twice a day) taken for hormone therapy and testosterone cream daily (2% cream, MWF, 2 clicks per day) taken for hormone therapy. Family medical history included her parents and sister all were vaccinated and were fine. Her dad and sister have heart conditions but have been fine, no one had any effects other than like sore arm and tired. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day of vaccine vaccination. The patient did not have any previous history of immunization with Pfizer vaccine. On 30Apr2021, the patient experienced post-menopausal vaginal bleeding. The bleeding was on and off a couple times, but it was not going on anymore. The reporter stated that, she had spotting occur a week later on 30Apr2021 and then she was full on bleeding from the 03May2021 to 09May2021. She said it was not like it has only been a couple years, she said she normally does not bleed. Patient contacted the doctor when she had spotting. She was having sex and did not really associate it with the vaccine because she had her shot in the arm and didn&#39;t have many symptoms from it. It has been a while since her last period. She used to have lighter periods she was not a heavy bleeder but with this she had super tampons in and pads and went through them in an hour, intermittently. It was a lot of blood. Patient spoke with her gynecologist who sent her to get an ultrasound because she said she should not be bleeding so she wanted to rule out cancer. The ultrasound was on 06May2021 and was normal. The doctor gave her 5mg norethindrone to take every night. It was given to stop the bleeding; it was 5 tablets one every night. She took it from the 06May2021 to the 10May2021 and her doctor said it should stop within a couple days, but it took longer, it stopped on 10May2021. Then it started again and bled from 13May2021 to 17May2021. After 17May2021, there was no more bleeding. Is pretty sure it was 17May2021, was roughly around that time. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included pregnancy test: not pregnant on an unspecified date, ultrasound scan: normal on 06May2021 and blood work: unknown results on 02Jun2021. The outcome of the events was resolved on 17Apr2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient kept bleeding and called md back and notified that not only did the bleeding NOT stop, the flow had increased to an alarming rate and amount.  6/1/21 spoke to office again and nurse advised patient to pick up an rx for progesterone to assist in stopping the bleeding.  Patient started the rx on 6/7/21. The patient had increased blood flow and started passing clots and went in for an exam.  MD changed drug and increased dosing.

                                                I was diagnosed with Atrial fibrillation  after this shot. The first shot was 03-18-2021. A heart monitor for 30 days caught the AFib.  Dr referred me to the electrophysiologist in their office for treatment of A-Fib. I have fluttering that feels like butterflies and it flutters in my back shoulder blade. A heart ablation (surgery) is recommended. The event monitored showed over 8, 500 abnormal heartbeats. A fib was caught during the 2nd week of wearing the monitor which was shortly after the 1st Pfizer shot.

A 47-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:49 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   There were no known medical history or concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced nausea, headache, and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                47-year-old female presented for anaphylactic allergic reaction after getting her first dose of Covid19 vaccine.  Patient was initially seen by Dr., who then signed out to me pending observation and reevaluation.  In summary, patient had received total of 2 EpiPen 1 at home and 1 in the ED in conjunction with soluMedrol, Benadryl, and Pepcid.  Patient has history of anxiety and jittery as well as nervousness after epinephrine.  Patient was then given 1 mg p.o. Ativan for her symptom.     On my evaluation, patient is not in respiratory distress, She is still  Tachycardic in the 110s-120s  Which is likely from the EpiPen.  Patient stated that she normally stays tachycardic for a while after the epipen.  Patient otherwise not in respiratory distress, her posterior pharynx and her uvula is not swelling.  Patient also has no wheezing on auscultation exam.  We discussed the possibility of staying in the hospital under observation versus going home.  Patient reported she is back at baseline and would like to be discharged and I was in agreement with this plan. Patient does has 3 more epipen at home to use for worsening symptoms. She will be prescribed medrol dose pack. Red flags signs and symptoms were discussed with strict return instruction were given. Patient verbalized understanding and was in agreement with the plan. She was then discharged in stable condition.

Had pain and throbbing in leg couldn?t sleep with pain so on  the evening of March 3rd I went to urgent care . Doctor didn?t think it was blood clot because I had no swelling or redness in my leg but gave me a script for ultrasound. I couldn?t get an appointment until  the morning of March 5th . Was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in lower leg  going up past my knee. I am now in Eliquis blood thinner for 3 months while they run tests

Initially they thought it was just a reaction to my high sugar levels, since the mri&#39;s showed I did not have evidence of a stroke. It wasn&#39;t until I saw a retina specialist the following Tuesday that she confirmed that yes I did have a stroke in my eye. I have not recovered my vision fully in my eye or the sensation in my tongue. I didn&#39;t connect it to the vaccination until I spoke with a friend whose sister also got pfizer 5 days before me and suffered a stroke 3 days before me, and two days after we spoke they announced Johnson&amp; Johnson pause due to clots in women. The retina specialist says we will have to wait and see if the damage heals on it&#39;s own in the meantime I need to see her on a monthly basis.

She had chest tightness in the first 10 minutes and received two oral Benadryl capsules. At about 20 minutes post vaccination, she then felt her throat swelling up and we then had to give her three epipens. Her symptoms included chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing, and eventually throat swelling, which resulted in a brief, repeated loss of consciousness.

                                                I had a tattoo done on Sunday night (4/18). I have had many tattoos before this. The first two days of healing went great, but I woke up on Thursday morning with horrific symptoms. Weeping fluid and ink to the point where my skin was coming off in sheets. Extreme pain, swelling and bleeding. I assumed it was an infection or an allergy, but it is not infected. I don&#39;t think it was an allergy, unless it was a mild allergy exacerbated by the vaccine. Healing has been truly terrible and I&#39;m still on the road to recovery now.

A 47-year-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 02Apr2021 (lot number: EW0150) as single dose (at the age of 47-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation, vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included hypothyroidism, anxiety, and chronic migraine (ongoing). The patient had no known food and drug allergies. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); sumatriptan for migraines; and clonazepam for anxiety. The patient received the first dose of BNT16B2 on 15Mar2021 09:00 am (lot number: EN6708) (at the age of 47-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient died on 14Apr2021 01:30 pm of a sudden death. She was found at home unresponsive and pulseless. Efforts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. Her medical history of hypothyroidism, anxiety and chronic migraines do not appear to be contributory. The patient did not receive treatment (as reported). The reporter considered the event to be a serious adverse effect (SAE). A full autopsy has been performed; the results were pending.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: died on 14Apr2021 01:30 pm of a sudden death

                                                I felt light headed shortly after leaving or within the 1/2 hour after vaccine. Later that evening i had a migraine. The following day another migraine. It went away and Monday it returned.  I began taking Aleve and it eventually stopped. The Thursday after vaccination (4/15/21) i woke up full of blood like a period however it was not time for my period and the bleeding went away early that morning. Every other day after that i was getting spotting and i am still getting it.  At the same time the bleeding started, i was having knots in my stomach that made me have multiple bowel movements daily. Every thing i ate would send me to the bathroom a few hours later.   I have chronic constipation and have bowel movements usually 2-3 times a week but this vaccine had me going 2- 3 times a day . This lasted from until a day before i was due for my 2nd vaccine. I had the second dose 4/30/2021 and had no issues until today when the stomach knots and multiple bowel movements resumed. I am hoping it&#39;s going to pass quickly since i had no issues from the second dose. It was the first dose that was awful for me

Minor soreness of nipples shortly after 1st vaccine, which was constant for 4 weeks but has since stopped (this has never happened).

Not normal for her-Severe, Additional Details: Pt had to get a Toradol shot for a migraine in the left arm 6-7 days after the shot in the left arm that was vaccinated. She ended up getting a red , ropey looking line starting from the injection site up her arm that also had knodules going up that line as well. So she thinks that the heavy period with a lot of clots was caused by the injection and that the phlebitis of the left arm was possibly from the shot as well because she has had other IVs in her arms before that did not cause reaction

                                                Monday April 5th I started bleeding.   I thought it was my normal period.    Tuesday I started having major abdomin pain.   It was so bad I couldnt walk.   The pain would subside and then I would bleed alot.    Then the pain would start again.  The pain would subside and I would start bleeding alot again.   This was like labor.  Wednesday I had a lot of tissue come out of me so I realized this must be a miscarriage.   My doctor told me to take a pregnancy test and sure enough it tested positive  I was about 5- 7 weeks pregnant. As far as pregnancy history, I also miscarried February 11th.  (went in for the ultrasound and fetus wasnt moving around 9 weeks).   Had first child at 35 and 2nd at 40.   My instincts tell me the vaccine had something to do with  my 2nd miscarriage (April 5th).

I started having a bad bowel movement, no fever, stiffness, joints aching, and dull aches. I had a hard time resting. The next day when I woke up, I had a bowel movement bad. When I went downstairs, I was bleeding from light to medium from my vagina. For 4 hours I had sharp pains in the middle of my chest. I went to see Doctor; my symptoms were gone for 5 days. Then 10 days ago my eyes were tearing a lot and painful. I went walking and had incredible pain in feet, ankle, knee, and I could barely stand. The next morning, I went to my PCP and referred me to a RA doctor and think it&#39;s an autoimmune disease.

                                                After ten minutes my throat began to feel swollen, a feeling of a lump in my throat.  After around 20 minutes I also began to feel more light headed/dizzy.  I was moved to be observed by a nurse for another 20 minutes and when symptoms did not subside I was moved to the Emergency Department where they administered Epinephrine at 9:27am, Pepcid, 9:24am, Solu-medrol 9:24-10:50am.  Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis. Dr. wanted to prescribe Benadryl IV but I declined as I needed to drive home and the facility was far from home. I was discharged around 1:00pm.   A prescription for an Epi Pen was made by Dr.  and filled that day at pharmacy.  and spoke to my Dr. at another healthcare organization at 4:30pm.  Benadryl OTC was then rx&#39;d by my primary care doctor at 4:30pm-50mg every 6 hrs moving to 25 mg every 6 hours the next day.   Symptoms of swollen throat continued into the next day and have not yet abated but also have not worsened. Due to continued throat swelling I have taken 50mg of Benadryl the next day as well. Dr. my primary care Dr. scheduled an allergist appt for Feb. 3, 2021 and advised I should not get the second dose of the COVID19 vaccine until I speak with an allergist and have a treatment plan developed.

This other HCP reported for herself that a 48-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) at the age of 48-years, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28Jan2021 10:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included nerve damage; multiple surgeries from a wreck. Patient was not pregnant, was not pregnant at time of vaccination, there was no other vaccine in four weeks. No COVID-19 prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA); loratadine (CLARITIN); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D); ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C); probiotics nos. The patient previously took rofecoxib (VIOXX), miconazole nitrate (MONISTAT), gabapentin, flu shot, all experienced allergies. At 10:45 AM on 28Jan2021, the patient experienced shortness of breath (SOB), BP 209/109 within 15 minutes of the shot, clammy, major headache. Received diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) on site and transferred by ambulance to hospital where she received Epishot, dexamethasone and ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL). Diagnosed with anaphylactic shock. Went home with elevated BP and major headache. Daughter called an ambulance that night because the headaches were so bad. Ambulance driver stated they couldn&#39;t do anything for patient at the hospital unless she exhibited stroke like symptoms. BP stayed elevated for 2 days and headaches continued. Started to feel better 5 days later. Followed up with her PCP and patient was put on steroids for 5 days to taper down. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other HCP office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient received BENADRYL, epinephrine, dexamethasone, TORADOL as treatment for AEs. Lab data included: patient was tested negative for COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) on 23Feb2021. Outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the events anaphylactic shock, BP increased and headache with BNT162b2 use can not be completely excluded.

                                                Within a short time after receiving my COVID vaccination, I experienced a burst of energy, pretty severe abdominal cramping, and vaginal bleeding (small amount; very close location-wise to being internal but was external). Bleeding lasted until bedtime and was gone, along with the abdominal cramping and burst of energy by the next morning and has never returned.  Vaccine #2 was on 2/9/21 and the only difference I felt after that one was tiredness; took a 3 hour nap shortly after I returned home and never noticed anything else since.  (Not sure if this helps to know...I had a hysterectomy mid-October, 2020.)

This is my 4th child and I never have a period while breastfeeding.    This period was non stop bleeding for more than 24 hours.   Bright red which is unusual because it shouldn?t be fresh blood since it?s been 18 months.  Happened almost 2 weeks after second shot.   I also had a lot of post vaccine symptoms after second shot which include fever, chills, aches and breathing issues. Those lasted a week.   Tested for coronavirus during that timeframe and was negative.  Still bleeding, on 3rd  day, still bright red but not gushing like it was.

A 48-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: Er8735), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 27Apr2021 at 12:45 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 in Dec2020 and was sick for 4 months, neutropenia, allergy to latex; until the virus in Dec2020, the patient would hemorrhage no less than 3 weeks and spotted always for 4 months since COVID-19. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL), ibuprofen (ADVIL 12 HOUR) and ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (PORTIA 21). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: Er8732) on 31Mar2021 at 10:00 (at the age of 48-years-old) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and felt a little yucky. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) and experienced allergies. On 29Apr2021 at 10:00 (also reported as 48 hours after the 2nd vaccination), the patient started gushing hemorrhaging female-wise. She described this as bleeding through her pads. Within a week in May2021, (also reported as a few days later), the patient experienced malaise, extreme nausea, throbbing of her arms and legs, and dizziness laying down. She said she felt really bad. She said she was rushed to the emergency room on 03May2021, and then again on 06May2021. The patient also reported feeling sick with fevers as of 04May2021 (also reported that she doesn&#39;t know when it started or ended) after the hospital, she was not able to make sense now. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days as of 06May2021 and was considering going back as she was feeling worse. At the hospital, the patient received fluids and antibiotics. The patient was treated with a supplement to slow the blood flow. She did not know if it was improving, persistent or worsening. For 3 days she could not take the supplement but started to bleed more yesterday (probably because she didn&#39;t take the supplement). Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The clinical outcome of &#34;she started hemorrhaging female wise&#34;, malaise, extreme nausea, throbbing of her arms and legs, dizziness, feeling sick and fever was not resolved.

A 48-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 05May2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic smoker 2 packs per day. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications within 2 weeks of vaccination included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, it was unknown if the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient developed headache, fatigue, dyspnea, and chest pain for 3 days. She was admitted to hospital on 08May2021 with a completed right ventricular (RV) infarction. Angio in May2021 showed clean coronaries with the exception of a large amount of clot in the right coronary artery(RCA). Given correlation to vaccine administration, unclear if this was related (as reported). Device Date: 11May2021 (as reported). The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The events were assessed as serious, hospitalization and life-threatening. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As a cautionary measure and considering the drug-event temporal relationship of three days, the company cannot completely exclude a causal association between the administration of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE BNT162B2 and the onset of all the reported events. Medical history of chronic smoker (2 packs per day) cannot be also excluded as contributing factor and additional information of medical history and concomitant medications concerning possible risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, should be also useful for an overall assessment of the case.  The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This is second case of two reports. A 48-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injectio), intramuscularly administered in right arm on 26Feb2021 09:00 am (at an age of 48-year-old during vaccination) as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included Hashimotos disease from 2000 and ongoing, high blood pressure from unknown date and ongoing, breast cancer from 2015 underwent lumpectomy on Dec2015, ovarian cyst from 2020 and ongoing, Afib (atrial fibrillation) from Apr2019 to an unknown date, atrial fibrillation event due to too much thyroid medication and heart had extra beat benign. The patient&#39;s family history included methylation issues, cardiac issues, cancer, higher BP, medication don&#39;t work like they should on many family members. Concomitant medication(s) included levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT) taken for Hashimotos disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing, levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE) oral taken for Hashimoto&#39;s disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing, alprazolam (XANAX) taken for anxiety from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mecobalamin (B12 METHYLCOBALAMIN) methylated B-12 taken for methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency (MTHFR deficiency) from an unspecified start date and ongoing; vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]), zinc (ZINC); ergocalciferol (VIT D); calcium, magnesium (CALCIUM MAGNESIUM [CALCIUM;MAGNESIUM]); calcium levomefolate (METHYL FOLATE).  The patient previously received of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: Not reported), intramuscularly administered in right arm on 28Jan2021 13:30 as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility was reported as high school for 1st dose and public health clinic for 2nd dose. The patient had not taken any other vaccine 4 weeks prior to Covid-19 vaccination. On 31Jan2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedures which include blood work: unknown result, did not show heart attack or blood clot, apple watch as abnormal, heart rate was 144 at rest and x-ray as normal. The patient stated that she had ER trip after vaccination. Doctor though she had an embolism and wanted to do a CT. Because of her breast cancer she wanted to avoid heavy radiation and instead she did her x-ray and blood work. On 31Jan2021, the patient experienced two cardiac events. Heart racing was major, so she went to emergency response center. Her oxygen was 90, her heart rate was 144 at rest. Second time lasted a few minutes. On the same day (31Jan201), the patient stated that both events wake her from sleep and took her breath away and also felt that dermal filling around mouth felt numb right after 1st vaccine around 20 min after which lasted a while ago. On unknown date in Feb2021, the patient experienced stroke like headpain, felt like having stroke then heart racing, fever wiped her out, rapid heart rate, chills, pain, fatigue for a few weeks. She also experienced arm felt it was beaten with a bat. These events were presented for nighttime for 2 days. The seriousness of the events considered as disability and the event arm felt like it was beaten with a bat was assessed as non-serious. Therapeutic measures such as heated blanket was taken to chills and fever. The patient took treatment medication such Tylenol, Xanax to slow heart rate and electrolytes for the resulted events. The outcome of the events was recovered for all events in Feb2021 and unknown for the event arm felt like it was beaten with a bat.

                                                I went to chemo therapy in 2018 for colon cancer after colon resection surgery. During chemo my first port failed and caused a huge blood clot in my neck and left arm. I have had three other events in my life of having blood clots, I did not know getting the vaccine would make me so susceptible for more. I got a huge blood clot in my neck and another one in my left arm after receiving the vaccination, my left arm swelled up huge at the elbow, with pain. Blood clots are not always painful for me, depends on where it?s at. I also have swollen lymph nodes in my armpits from the vaccine, confirmed by my oncologist. I went to the ER for the blood clots and again returned two days later to make sure I did not have PE, however the nodules in my lungs had enlarged and my lymph nodes are swollen. This is well after two weeks after I got the second dose of the vaccine, however, the blood clots take time to get as big as they are, so this probably started after the first injection, perhaps just got worse after the second one. I am now stuck on blood thinners forever because of this vaccine, I will not be getting any more of these shots.

                                                chest pain; shortness of breathe; having difficulty standing; Thought she was having a heart attack; O2 saturation decreased; Another lab (she could not identify) that was high; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 48-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01May2021 (Lot Number: EW0175) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Patient took the first dose in Arm Right on 10Apr2021 (Lot Number: ER8730) for covid-19 immunization, and experienced hand pain, skin tightness, difficulty in standing, pain, heaviness in arm, back pain, walking difficulty. Vaccine Administered at (Name) Facility was No. Medical history included, sickle cell from 01Sep1972 and ongoing, ongoing penicillin allergy since she was a kid, ongoing drug allergy to other medications. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she got the second shot on 01May2021 and she did not experience the funny feeling and had nothing at the injection site. Sunday was okay. Monday morning around 7am she started having severe chest pain and shortness of breathe and couldn&#39;t breathe. It was getting more and more severe. She had an appointment and the Nurse Practitioner said next time don&#39;t stay home and go to an ER if you feel all that pain. So on Tuesday she said let me get out of the house and go to the appointment. Someone that understood saw her and thought she didn&#39;t look well and ambulance people said she did not look well and they wanted her to go to the ER. She said she would watch it because she had a similar reaction with the first one but it was in her back. They checked her out and said it is the vaccine because she was not having this severity of anything before and they wanted to take her to the ER. They took her information and she said let me watch it and see. She continued to her appointment and it got worse and worse and in the evening after the appointment they had to take her to the ER because she thought she was having a heart attack. At the ER they drew troponin, which was normal, and another lab (she could not identify) that was high and they thought she may have had a blood clot so they did a CT with contrast and it was negative for blood cot, so they ruled out a blood clots in her lungs. Patient reported that while she was out for her errands and appointments, someone was concerned for her on the street because she was very short of breath and having difficulty standing. Patient reported that there was a fire department ambulance parked close by. It reported that the paramedics assisted her into the ambulance and took her pulse ox and blood pressure. The paramedics told her that her O2 sat was low and wanted her to go to the hospital via ambulance. Caller reported that she did not want to have to pay the bill for the ambulance, so she declined transport to the emergency room. Caller reported that she want to another appointment. Caller reported that the pain was there and was severe, but she pushed through with the thought in the back of her head that the chest pain would not continue. Caller reported that she kept hanging on to the thought that maybe the chest pain will last the same amount as her back following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that around 4:00 PM or 5:00 PM on 03May2021, the chest pain was not going away and she was concerned for her heart. Caller reported that she was taken over to the emergency room. Caller reported that while she was in the emergency room, she was trying to tell the staff that she had gotten the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that the emergency room staff was more concerned about doing things and wanted to give her aspirin. Caller reported that she refused the aspirin and told the emergency room staff to do lab tests first. Caller reported that her troponin came back and the emergency room staff said that her heart was ok at that time. Caller reported that she was still short of breath and her O2 sat was very low while she was in the emergency room on 03May2021. Caller reported that another lab test was very high. Caller reported that she was not kept overnight in the emergency room. Caller reported that she came home after leaving the emergency room and the chest pain was there during the night on 03May2021. Caller reported that on 04May2021 around midday, the chest pain started subsiding but she was still sore breathing in and out. Caller reported that by Thursday, 06May2021, there was just soreness in her chest and by Friday, 06May2021, she was fine and back to baseline. Caller reported that the emergency room physician informed her that her side effects may be something to do with the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that it has to be the Covid-19 vaccine that caused her side effects. Event chest pain required a visit to Emergency Room, no event required a visit to Physician Office. The outcome of events were reported as recovered on 07May2021.

                                                massive pulmonary embolism; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable physician. A 48-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 (at age of 48 years old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. Medical history included asthma and menorrhagia. No past drug.  Concomitant medication(s) the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (SPRINTEC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient experienced massive pulmonary embolism on 10Apr2021 with outcome of recovering. The adverse event result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was hospitalized for massive pulmonary embolism for 30 days.  catheter-directed thrombolysis received for event. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of pulmonary embolism due to temporal relationship.  However, the concomitant medication of ethinylestradiol, norgestimate may have contributed to the development of the PE.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including VQ scan, pulmonary angiogram results and coagulation panel, and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                &#34;I received the Pfizer Covid vaccine Wed afternoon around 4pm. Thursday morning around 9:30 I started with severe pain in my left leg. The pain worsened through the day and my leg began swelling. No other symptoms at all. This morning my leg was twice the size of my right leg so I went to the ER. I live in so I&#39;m at ED. I have a massive blood clot running the the length of my leg - from my thigh to my ankle. I&#39;m very lucky I got here so fast! I?m a very healthy 49 year old with no history of DVT or blood clots so they dug further to find out why. A cat scan showed I have a congenital condition called May Thurner Syndrome. I?m so relieved to have an answer and it?s fixable! The vascular doctors are not 100% convinced that?s not all that was going on as I was born with the syndrome and I?ve gone this long without a clot. So they are doing lots of labs to see if anything else shows up. This is where we are at. I?m being admitted to take care of the clot.&#34;

A 49-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location; Arm) on 22Jan2021 13:00 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included biotin from an unspecified date and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 29Dec2020 (around 10:00 am to 12:00 pm at a hospital) and had the usual side effects of a little bit of nausea, developed a dry cough, some fatigue, and diarrhea and that kind of stuff. The reporter called about the Pfizer COVID vaccine and was calling on behalf of his wife who was the patient. Reporter stated that before the Pfizer COVID vaccine, patient used to walk the dogs 6 miles a very fast pace and had no problem, then she got her 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 29Dec2020 and had the usual side effects of a little bit of nausea, developed a dry cough, some fatigue, and diarrhea and that kind of stuff. The reporter stated that after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, the symptoms she reported have worsened and the cough, fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea began immediately after the 1st dose of the vaccine where the cough started a week or so after the 1st dose and then after the 2nd dose, the cough never went away and got worse and worse and worse. Reporter stated the fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and cough were all ongoing and have gotten worse. Reporter mentioned that for the cough after the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, it was still there but was occasional and was not too bad but when the patient had the 2nd dose on 22Jan2021 and was knocked on her butt for about three days; also stated that the patient had fever, chills, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and the works and had all the symptoms. It was also reported that the patient was very sick for 3-4 days with same symptoms. Reporter mentioned that fatigue was getting worse and the cough never went away and always had the dry cough which was getting worse and worse and worse with any activity and was a dry cough and she never had any phlegm. Reporter also stated the patient got to where she did less and less activity and was worse and the dry cough was worse with nothing coming up. It was reported that the patient sought treatment for everything she believed last week on Monday but was unsure of the dates. Monday of last week, patient went to the emergency room in a hospital and was told that they thought that the patient had an enlarged heart and severely low potassium and the patient was put on an IV drip of potassium because she could not tolerate the oral potassium and threw up the oral potassium so she was put on two bags of IV potassium. On an unknown date, it was reported that patient started having pain in her chest from the IV drip of potassium but she was released from the emergency room and the 2nd day of last week which was the next day, patient went back to the emergency room because she was having issues and everything was getting worse. Reporter also stated that the 2nd of last week, the patient collapsed and an ambulance came and got her on Tuesday of last week though reporter was unsure of the dates. Reporter also mentioned that patient went to a hospital and had severe chest pain and collapsed pressure on her chest. Reporter stated that the patient at that time had the dry cough and stuff and the hospital told the patient that the patient had fluid build up around her heart and lungs which was maybe due to the treatment from the IV potassium and was told she has a weakened heart. It was reported that with a weakened heart, the heart can&#39;t process fluid around the lungs and the heart and it puts pressure on heart supposedly. It was reported that on Wednesday last week, the patient went to the emergency room for the 3rd day in a row and already had an appointment with the HCP which was an appointment with her new primary Nurse Practitioner for the first appointment and she confirmed that the patient had fluid on the lungs when she saw the patient. Reporter stated that the nurse practitioner could not admit the patient because the hospital she admits too was full so she sent the patient to a hospital emergency room where they did all the tests and everything confirmed what they said and they transferred the patient to another hospital where the patient stayed in the hospital  a total of three days and was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and they started treatment on the patient. The patient was started on Entresto later on and tomorrow there was a follow up visit with her primary HCP and they have to follow up because the patient was released from the hospital and was very weak and she has to wear a lifevest because she is a heart patient and has a weak heart. It was reported that patient is going to be taking medications and stuff and will go see the HCP and they gave her beta blockers and other stuff and she will follow up with the HCP. It was reported that any of the medications including the beta blockers the patient was taking, reporter has no names of the medications, dosages or lot numbers or other information to provide at this time and stated that the patient was treated with those medications in the hospital and that was the hospital in another city and state. Reporter mentioned that it was last week when the patient collapsed while trying to walk across the yard and she was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy where part of the heart shrunk which is the expelling chamber of the heart and the HCP stated where a normal 20-30 year old would have heart function of 55, the patient had an output of 15. Reporter stated that the HCP said that stroke, disease or things like that can cause cardiomyopathy and there are various things that can cause it but they can&#39;t diagnose what caused this in the patient because she has not had various things and the only she had was the Pfizer COVID shots that hit her very hard and she just turned age 50. Reporter stated that the patient was age 49 at the time she began experiencing the symptoms that were reported and just turned age 50. Reporter clarified to state the potassium drip the patient had was not at this hospital but was at another hospital. Reporter stated he has no lot numbers, expiry dates or NDC numbers to provide as he does not have the patient card for the Pfizer COVID Vaccine that the patient received and that paperwork is with the patient who is staying at her sister&#39;s house so the sister can help monitor the patient. Reporter also mentioned that patient was not taking medications at the time she received the Pfizer COVID Vaccine at that time but was taking over the counter Biotin and states he has no lot, expiry date or UPC to provide. Reporter mentioned that patient has no family history of heart conditions but he thinks the patient&#39;s mother is diabetic but she is the only who is diabetic and there is no other history he is aware of. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I was prescribed 15 mg of Xarelto twice a day for 21 days. Prior to this incident I have been on Xarelton 20 mg/day for life since October of 2014 for an &#34;idiopathic&#34; blood clotting disorder.

                                                I waited about 30 minutes.  Felt tingly and a bit light headed but cracked it up to being tired from the shot.  I got in my car and about 5 minutes out driving in the middle of traffic,  I felt like I was going to pass out like I had once before with anaphylaxis- at the wheel.  There is no mistaking the feeling.  I could not feel my pulse at all.    Fortunately I had a EpiPin in my car and I was able to jab it in my leg and within a minute or two I had the energy to turn the car around and get back to the folks at site who were wonderful.  I then took benadryl as advised and the EMS were called.  I was taken to site where they gave me a steriod, pepsid and monitored me until I went home later that evening.  I was told to take benadryl for the next 24 hours and I did.

She thought they had hit bone; less range of movement in her left foot; trouble walking; like someone who had a stroke; numbness; legs felt heavy climbing stairs; immediate pain when needle went all the way in and worse when vaccine went in; pain in shoulder joint; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: Ep6955), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 18:00 (at the age of 49years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included anemia that is treated, living kidney donor, gastric bypass in 1999, gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, intussusception x2, migraines, high heart rate, and smoking. Concomitant medications included omeprazole (OMEPRAZOLE), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine and Tetanus vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. She got the shot on 25Mar2021 on Thursday evening at 1800. She is 49 years old and has had all the flu shots and tetanus shots. She has never had one hurt so bad. She stated that the vaccine was given up high on her arm, not 2 fingers down. She thought they had hit bone. It was reported that the patient experienced immediate pain when needle went all the way in and worse when vaccine went in. The whole time it hurt really bad and her arm hurt severely for 2 days from 25Mar2021. She still has pain in shoulder joint. That aside wasn&#39;t a big deal, it went away even though the joint is sore. The following Monday 29Mar2021 in the evening, her legs felt heavy and she had trouble going up the stairs. Then she had complete numbness of her left leg, from her hip or butt crack to the tip of her toes. It was on the same side she had the shot. It was further reported that the patient&#39;s legs felt heavy climbing stairs then she woke Thursday morning with her left leg numb. She couldn&#39;t feel herself starting to have a bowel movement because the numbness went all the way up to that area. She went to the ER (emergency room) on Saturday night (03Apr2021) because she was afraid of a blood clot. An ultrasound was done on her left leg, CT of head and neck, and blood work with nothing found. She has numbness and less range of movement in her left foot with trouble walking and have had no improvement with calf being numb. It was further clarified that when she was Easter shopping, there was numbness in her foot was causing her to drag her foot around the store. It was like someone who had a stroke, with slight impairment on one side. Her foot slaps the floor. She doesn&#39;t have control of it, she can&#39;t flex her foot up and down at all and she has little movement in her toes, even now. When she went to the emergency room, she thought she had a blood clot. She is a kidney donor and is healthy over all except for anemia that gives her tingly toes since she was 30, off and on. She never had a body part felt so numb, other than when she sits on her leg wrong. They did a bunch of tests there. They did a doppler, CT scan, and an EKG (unspecified date) which was abnormal. Her EKG has never been abnormal before. It said possible septal infarct undetermined time. The doppler showed no deep or superficial blockages noted from her groin down to her toes/ankle. The doppler was to check for blood clots. They referred her to her primary care provider who said that she will do a neurological exam. She has weakness in her left arm as well. The weakness in her left arm was only told by the neuro touch test. The patient further clarified that she doesn&#39;t have less range of motion, it is really just pain (arm). She can still move her arm all the way. Her left side is weaker or less sensitive as far as the neuro test. She wasn&#39;t aware she had less feeling on her arm until the nurse said she did. Her arm pain is nothing significant, it can hurt when moving her arm. She had no leg pain or anything like that until later in the week. She still had symptoms of losing her balance. Getting in and out of the chair she almost fell down. She didn&#39;t realize the numbness. Monday, she felt heaviness going up the stairs. For 2 days she had the worst pain ever in her arm. She had the tetanus shot and didn&#39;t have anything like that. It went away, when she raises her arm off from the side, she still has pain in the joint. She has migraines, it is nothing that is causing difficulty. She is more concerned something else happened. Patient thought maybe it is MS (multiple sclerosis) and asked if it is peripheral artery disease. She did smoke half a pack every other day. She is 49 but didn&#39;t start smoking till she was 36. It is a terrible habit and her doctor is aware. She also had her good and bad cholesterol which was just over 100. She is just reporting it because it happened on only the left side and she is a healthy person. She never had high blood pressure and never been treated for it, but she has had high heart rate before. It is not something that has ever caused any issue. She doesn&#39;t have something like peripheral artery disease, when she (software company name withheld) that is said plaque in the arteries. The doppler showed no signs of blockage superficial or deep on that side. She doesn&#39;t have an appointment until 29Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t know what to do to get more urgent care. The pain in her arm was better after the first 2 days. It is like a tooth ache, a dull ache. It is not all the time, just when moving her arm. Her legs were worse to where Thursday, she woke, and she was numb from the top of her leg to the tip of her toe. She can still lift her leg, but when she walks the tip of her second toe which is longer will drag on the ground. When she walks it is hard to hold her shoe on the left foot or put her shoe on. She can&#39;t maneuver her foot. When her foot hits the ground, the ball area of her foot smacks the floor because she doesn&#39;t have control over it. It is laboring to walk and is hard. She was kind of limping and pulling that leg on the left side. Her laboratory tests were BMP, CBC auto diff, CBC with diff, CT, angiogram of the head and neck, EKG 12 lead, and they did a venous doppler of the left lower extremity. It all came back good except the EKG which says septal infarct undetermined date, which has never come up on any tests before. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, Disability or permanent damage. There was no treatment received for the adverse event. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.

Anaphylaxis, initial encounter  This is a 49-year-old female that presents emergency department 1 hour after receiving her 2nd COVID vaccine (pfizer), and states that she waited her 15 minutes after receiving the shot and felt fine.  She then reports that when she got to the car she started feeling some chest tightness a bit of more difficulty with her breathing and felt like her throat was scratchy and a bit tight as well.  She has had complications with taking the flu vaccine as well as a tetanus shot.  Where she has had rashes then enlarged lymph nodes.  But never this reaction.  She has never been hospitalized or brought to the ER due to anaphylaxis.  She does not use an epinephrine pen at home.  Patient states before the shot she was feeling well.  She does not have any systemic symptoms like fever, nasal congestion or sore throat.  Patient also denies any recent episodes of vomiting or diarrhea. This patient came in the emergency department was concerning signs and symptoms for anaphylaxis.  The patient was immediately given a dose of IV Solu-Medrol 125 mg, IV Benadryl 50 mg, and 20 mg of IV Pepcid.  Patient was placed on cardiac monitor.  I went back to re-evaluate the patient she was feeling significantly improved within a short period of time.  Patient was monitored in our emergency department for most 2 hours.  Patient&#39;s symptoms had resolved.  Patient was comfortable being discharged home.  Patient has several allergies in her history.  Patient was sent home with a prescription for prednisone as well as Pepcid.  Patient also given a prescription for an epinephrine pen and told and instructed on how and when to use this.  The patient is going to have someone pick her up as she was instructed that the Benadryl can make her very drowsy and a would be rather unsafe to drive.  She was going to contact a family member to pick her up.  Patient will return if she has any more symptoms

Left lower extremity VTE found on ultrasound requested by her PCP.  She reports she may have had COVID-19 in December.  She reports she had just completed second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 4/15.  Appears it would give about 7 days since the second dose, and onset of her symptoms. She does state she had been somewhat less mobile after her illness.  She does not smoke.  She is not on any hormone therapy. Not entirely clear that this is related to the vaccination, however, will discuss with pharmacy regarding whether this should be reported. We discussed anticoagulation.  She started on Lovenox and ER.  Discussed subsequently switching to oral anticoagulation. We will assess TTE.  Monitor oxygenation, blood pressure, heart rates.       Status: Acute (2) Deep vein thrombosis of lower extremity:        Initiated on anticoagulation as above.  Ultrasound reports VTE including common femoral vein.  We will try to see if we can get a limited study to assess more proximal veins.  Discussed with her in case of concern symptoms, iliofemoral VTE, consideration may be given as well to catheter directed TPA.  She understands that this procedure is not available at the current facility. We discussed also regarding possibility of post phlebitis syndrome, especially with more proximal VTE.  Discussed strategies going forward to reduce the symptoms.

Please note that this was not like a regular menstrual period and I was not due for my period. I also bled after my first Pfizer vaccine but it was not alarmingly heavy like it was after this second dose. After this second vaccine dose, I was fatigued during the bleeding and after. The fatigue was resolved two weeks after I received the second vaccine. One other strange side effect was that three days after I received the second vaccine my left hand was slow to respond when I needed to type on the computer. This lasted for several days.

                                                I am anaphylactic survivor.  I felt it instantly after the shot: pain up my neck, left side of my back &amp; shoulders, then few minutes later metallic taste in mouth,  then nose was stinging, then runny nose and then a few mins later shortness of breath.  Told my family about it and they said it was probably side affect, minor/seasonal allergies and that I could take Claritin-D 24-hr.  It appeared to have minimized the  shortness of breath, which comes &amp; goes every few (15 or 30) mins, but still runny nose. I took for 3 days.  When I stopped taking Claritin-D 24-hr on Wed in the AM, in the afternoon, started to have difficulty breathing  and runny nose.  But it was stronger,  shallow breathing.  So I took Claritin-D 24-hr again but it wasn&#39;t working that well, so, took Benedryl at night as well. Then I took an additional Benedryl.  I still have the symptoms but manageable with the allergy meds.

                                                acute DVT of left peroneal vein (in the left calf); This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer (patient).  This 49-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number not provided), via an unknown route, on 29Apr2021 11:30 (at the age of 49-year-old) at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No relevant medical history was provided. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Relevant concomitant medications included ibuprofen (ADVIL 12 HOUR). From 03May2021, the patient developed sharp, piercing pain in my left calf over several days. The frequency increased the early morning (06:00-09:00) of 09May2021 so she contacted her primary care physician to discuss what she thought might be an indicator of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). She presented to the Emergency Room the morning of 09May2021 and was diagnosed with acute DVT of left peroneal vein (in the left calf). She was given blood thinner. Pre-vaccination and post-vaccination COVID tests were not performed. The patient was recovering from the events.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

The patient&#39;s significant other/boyfriend was driving when he noticed the patient suddenly started to complain of  shortness of breath with chest pain and a maculopapular rash which later was followed by expressive aphasia and left hemiparalysis. She received Pepcid, solumedrol and Benadryl for the rash in the ER with improvement. Code neuro was called and TPA was given. Post TPA she was alert and oriented and she could currently write with her right hand and think of the words she has to say.  She had associated blurry vision which has resolved after TPA was administered. She also was not able to move her left lower extremity nor her left upper extremity which is also improving to some extent after TPA administration. So far CT/CTA head and CTA neck are negative and she has been admitted for likely acute cerebral vascular accident.

                                                On March 23, 2021, I began having an extremely heavy menstrual flow, passing clots and requiring protection to be changed at least hourly which lasted approximately three weeks.  There has been no period since that time.  Previous periods were irregular presumably related to peri-menopause, but were never heavy enough to change protection more often than every 4-5 hours and never lasted longer that 4-5 days.

On the 3rd of May I phoned the DR and they gave me Tranexamic acid tablets. I took that for several days until the symptoms subsided. I did have this happen seven years ago and had to get blood transfusions. This time, it started on that Sunday night and had resolved by Thursday.

A 49-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Apr2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8729) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation; paracetamol (TYLENOL), route of administration, start and stop date, batch/lot number and dose were not reported for an unspecified indication. Medical history included premature menopause. Patient not diagnosed with COVID-19 Prior to vaccination. The patient previously took penicilline and sulfa drugs and experienced allergy. Concomitant medications within 2 weeks of vaccination include Multivitamin and paracetamol (TYLENOL). No other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID. The patient experienced ITP (immune-mediated thrombocytopenia) on 23Apr2021. Patient received immunosuppression with steroids for the event. The outcome of event was not recovered. Patient received dose 2 administered in left arm on 06May2021 13:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0175). Patient has not been tested for COVID-19 Since the vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current limited available information and the drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event of Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia cannot be totally excluded/assessed.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

At 4am the day after the vaccine, I felt nauseated and feverish.  Within seconds afer taking nausea medication, I fainted.   Not sure how long I was unconscious, but there was a large pool of blood under my head and I was very cold.  I managed to get back into bed and called my husband who was out of town.  He called a neighbor who came and got me around 5:15 am, and took me to the emergency room. I arrived nauseated, with a headache, &amp; bleeding from a wound above my right eyebrow.  I was given a head CT scan &amp; stitches to close my head wound.  CT Scan was negative for brain trauma, but I did suffer a concussion.

                                                anaphylaxis; throat swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 50-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, lipids (as reported) and asthma. The patient was known allergies: codeine, iodine, shellfish, latex, and cefatrizine propyleneglycolate (CEFTIN). Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in hospital. The patient experienced anaphylaxis and throat swelling on 22Dec2020 with outcome of recovered in Dec2020.  The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment of epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, observation was received for the events.    Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis and throat swelling cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

The patient experienced arm swelling /left arm swelling (hospitalization) on 09Mar2021 with outcome of recovering , blood clots in arm/blood clots in left arm (hospitalization) on 11Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , swollen lymph nodes /swollen lymph nodes in left arm (hospitalization) on 11Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , nodules were found on her lungs/nodules in lungs (hospitalization) on 11Mar2021 with outcome of unknown , soreness at the injection site on 05Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , left arm discomfort on 08Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , left arm redness on 09Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient was hospitalized from 11Mar2021 to 12Mar2021. On 05Mar2021 she began to have arm pain.  48 hours later, patient&#39;s arm started really hurting her, something about her arm being sore on the day of injection and reporter said she was going to be sore and when she got back from going away for the weekend, she thought uh oh, there was a problem here, this was not normal, not right. On 10Mar2021, she experienced swells arm swelling and went to urgent care which was diagnosed with swollen lymph nodes and given Cheplex prescription at urgent care. 11Mar2021, daughter was admitted to hospital by her provider. Daughter was found to have blood clots in arm and continued swollen lymph nodes. Daughter was given IV cheplex and Eliquis while in hospital. Daughter will have to be on Eliquis for next 3 months per reporter. The patient had her first vaccine, Pfizer, and became ill with blood clots, swollen lymph nodes, and wound up in the hospital. Reporter stated that she and the patient were worried about her getting the second shot. The patient was on blood thinners and was seeing a pulmonary doctor and hematologist. She didn&#39;t know about her getting the second shot and thought this should be reported. The patient was due for the second vaccine next week on 26Mar2021 and she was still sick, should it be postponed or what? The patient went the night before the hospitalization to the Urgent Care and the doctor prescribed Keflex, an antibiotic and saw her primary care doctor the next morning and she put her in the hospital. Reporter stated they were getting nervous and wanted to report for side effects. She stated the patient was home from the hospital but still sick really bad. The patient went to Urgent Care 10Mar2021, saw her primary care 11Mar2021 and was sent to the hospital 11Mar2021. Reporter later clarified that the patient was sent to the Emergency Room and after a few hours, she was sent upstairs to be admitted for a 24 hour hospital stay. The patient received Eliquis; Keflex as treatment. Fluids at the hospital, unknown type. Reporter stated they decided the patient wasn&#39;t doing really well and went to the Urgent Care that night and were given Keflex because they felt there was an infection. When they discovered it further that there were blood clots, the patient was told to stay on the antibiotic and given fluids and put on blood thinner, Eliquis, states patient had never been on a blood thinner before. Patient was admitted on 11Mar2021 for 24 hours. Reporter stated that they kept the medicine going and then felt she was stable enough to be discharged the next night at around 18:00 to continue with Keflex antibiotic and Eliquis for 3 months. Reporter stated they were told to contact a hematologist and pulmonary doctor for the nodules in her lungs and to contact her primary doctor if not doing better in one week, but they will probably contact her tomorrow. Reporter clarified that the patient had a chest x-ray a couple of months ago and everything appeared fine, so she thinks that the nodules developed after the vaccine. The patient had a chest x-ray on 11Mar2021 and nodules were found on her lungs, scheduled to follow up with lung doctor. Reporter stated whether they were there before or not was unknown. No follow up X ray yet. Reporter would like to know if daughter should get second dose? Second dose was scheduled 26Mar2021. Adverse events required visit to emergency room: Urgent Care the night before, follow up the next morning with primary doctor, the doctor got her in right away and said she needs to go to the hospital. Yes, patient went through the ER, doctor said that she would be coming and then after there a while, she was admitted to the hospital. Adverse events required visit to physician office. Patient saw the doctor on 11Mar2021 and was sent to the hospital.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 02/26/2021.  She noted some wheezing and slight shortness of breath and shared this information with her PCP at her regularly scheduled visit on 03/01/2021.  PCP refilled inhaler at that time.  Her shortness of breath progressively worsened, and she was seen by another provider as a walk-in at the office of her PCP on 03/13/2021.  At that time, she was prescribed prednisone for 5 days, noting some improvement after a few days.  She received her 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03/19/2021.  The patient woke up on the morning of 03/20/21 with a swollen and painful leg and by 03/22/21 called PCP and was seen in the office.  PCP ordered D-Dimer and LE ultrasound. Per the patient, the D-dimer was abnormal and the LE U/S showed a blood clot.  PCP sent the patient to the ER, where a chest CT was ordered and showed a pulmonary emobolus.  She was admitted overnight and started on Eliquis, and discharged the next day after seeing a hematologist.

A 50-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number FR8732, on 05Apr2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot in lung from 26Mar2021 (according to the chest X-ray she did not still have it but she had not been to her pulmonologist yet), complete hysterectomy in Jan2021, liver condition, high cholesterol and blood clot. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood clot, ursodiol for liver condition, and pravastatin for high cholesterol. The patient had the first dose on 05Apr2021. She began feeling muscle pain and a burning sensation in her shoulder blade the Thursday after receiving the vaccine (08Apr2021) and into Friday (09Apr2021). She had muscle tightening and aching in her left shoulder on 08Apr2021. By Monday mid morning (12Apr2021) she had tingling all down her left arm, across her back, down her right arm and into both legs. She began having tingling in her arms and legs bilaterally since last Monday (12Apr2021), however it was more prominent in her left extremities rather than the right. She wanted to know if this was a side effect of vaccine. She got the shot in her left arm. She went to the hospital and they admitted her. She had tests in the ER. She had MRIs, CTs and a battery of blood tests. They could only tell her what it was not and not what it was. It was not cancer, stroke, heart attack, aneurysm or a brain tumor. She was released and did not know what caused it. Again from the above that on Thursday (08Apr2021) her left shoulder muscle started aching and on Monday a week later she experienced tingling. She thought she was having a heart attack and was hospitalized for 4 days. She asked the doctor if this was a side effect and she was told to call the place where the vaccine was administered. She called the nurse and she could not give answers and recommended that she call Pfizer.  Several conditions were ruled out but she was not given a reason for her symptoms. Her HCP has not been helpful. She stated she had a complete hysterectomy in January but doesn&#39;t think that would have any effect. She had a CT on 12Apr2021, a MRI of her head and neck on 12Apr2021, a MRI with contrast on 14Apr2021 of her upper neck, a MRI of her lower back on 15Apr2021 and a bone scan on 15Apr2021. Stated that they all came back normal no abnormalities. The outcome of muscle tightening was resolving. The outcome of heart attack was unknown. The outcome of other events was not resolved.

                                                bleeding from scratching the itching rash of the allergic reaction.; Allergic reaction; night itching; itching rash/rash all over her body; Pain in her arm and ankles; Pain in her arm and ankles/ pain in her ankles, on the bottom part of her legs around her ankles, very bad pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration and administered in left arm at age of 50-years, on 15Apr2021 15:00 (Lot Number: CW0151) as single dose; then second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration and administered in right arm at age of 50-years, on 07May2021 (at 12:30-12:40) (Lot Number: EW0167) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy to shellfish. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. There was no other vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine. There was no any other vaccinations within four weeks before or after the Pfizer Corona Vaccine. The patient previously took benadryl and experienced allergy (Doctor told her never to take Benadryl because she could die, could have anaphylaxis).  The patient administered both doses of the Pfizer Corona Vaccine. She believed she was having a very bad adverse effect from the vaccine, an allergic reaction. She also reported having had pain in her arm and ankles the day of her second dose of Pfizer Corona Vaccine. Onset 2 days after the Pfizer Corona Vaccine, unable to clarify date further or if after the first or second dose of the Pfizer Corona Vaccine. She ate a lot of fruits and vegetables, she had been practically a vegetarian for a long time. Allergic reaction started little by little when she would eat; but now it occurred every time she ate. Usually she ate in the late afternoon so now when she ate a lot of fruits and vegetables she spent the rest of the night itching; she was tearing into her skin now, bleeding from scratching the itching rash of the allergic reaction. Ever since she had taken the Pfizer Corona Vaccine, every times she ate a lot of fruits and vegetables she seemed to be getting this rash all over her body that won&#39;t go away. It was scary, she was scratching and itching, starting to get worried because she was bleeding everywhere. She was afraid she may eat and get anaphylaxis. The patient had Hydroxyzine and asked if she can take Hydroxyzine for the allergic reaction. She wondered if her allergy to Benadryl could be part of the allergic reaction she was having. She had always had an allergic reaction to Benadryl which made her very nervous. She had to just flush herself, drink a lot of water to flush her system.  About events Pain in arm and ankles: Time of onset unknown. Onset the first day (on 07May2021) when she took the second dose of Pfizer Corona Vaccine. She had very bad pain in her arm, could barely lift her arm, and also had pain in her ankles, on the bottom part of her legs around her ankles, very bad pain. The outcome of event Pain in arm and ankles was recovered completely by the following evening on 08May2021, of event allergic reaction was not recovered, while for remains events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.

                                                Wednesday, May 19, 2021 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot  Summary: Wednesday, May 19, 2021 received my 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot.  My body tried to reject it. I threw up 5 times.  Ensued many unwanted side effects.  I don?t think it would be good to get the 2nd vaccine dose.  Given I am not fully vaccinated, I need an alternative solution to prevent being infected with the virus.  Help!!!! Please Help!!!   Bad Side Effects: Stuffy Nose Congested Nose Headaches  Vomiting Nauseous   Upset Stomach  Unsettled Stomach  Unusual Perspiration Pain in Left Arm Abnormal Period Menstrual Blood Clots Shoulder Pain/Tension  Upper Back Pain/Tension  Chest Pain/Tension  Shooting Pain in Chest Heart Palpitations? Numbness Runny Nose Sneezing Profusely Allergies? Hoarse Voice  Winded  Dry Mouth   Existing Worsened: Cold Sores  Stomach Noises  Snoring? Foot Numbness Ear Ringing Eye Floaters Joints Popping Sound    Other Observations: Stomach Bloated  Increased Flatulence    Pseudo Conclusion: Given my body?s adverse reaction I don?t think it is wise to get the 2nd shot. It is obvious my body does not like it.  I am disappointed because I really did not plan to get vaccinated; however, I felt I had no other option when the government made the announcement.  When the government announced No masks for those vaccinated, I know there would be some NOT vaccinated &amp; NOT wearing a mask thus putting me at risk.         I am okay with wearing a mask for another year or even for the next 5 years.  The doctors have said me wearing a mask is protecting others not necessarily myself.  I concluded even if I continue to wear a mask there would be others (NO mask &amp; NOT vaccinated) not following the rules potentially exposing me to the virus. Hence the only way to protect myself is to get vaccinated.  The vaccine appears to have affected so many areas of my body.  I regret getting the 1st shot, I want to remove every trace of it from my anatomy.  Please let me know if it is possible to rid the vaccine along with all the bad side effects from my body.  I do not want to subject my body to anymore of this vaccine; however, I still need a reliable solution to avoid being infected with the virus. I don?t know what to do.    Details: Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received my 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot around 3:30pm.  The medical staff had all those being vaccinated to sit for at least 15 minutes for observation to be monitored.  I stayed for monitoring for close to an hour (wearing my masks).  I felt fine, I noticed my right nostril felt stuffy, congested with a slight burn sensation. I noticed a slight headache when I left.  I had about 3 errands to do.  2 hours later I wasn?t feeling well.  In addition to a stronger headache my stomach felt queasy. Around 6:30pm I had to pullover to vomit; I threw off my mask and threw up once and then a 2nd time. I sat in my car taking deep breaths until I felt I could make it home.  I make it home around 7pm in time to throw up 3 more times, for a total of 5 times. The vomit tasted acidic, sour, citrusy, and metallic at times, and salty.  I was only throwing up the vaccine it was mostly clear with white alka seltzer looking deposits. I last ate some crackers around 12 noon.  Vomiting is NOT normal for me.  I can?t remember the last time I threw up, many many many years ago.  l had a headache, queazy stomach, and was exhausted; about 7:30pm tried to sleep. I got up around 10:30pm ate a few saltines and drank a little water but I still didn?t feel good so I didn?t eat anything else. Rough night trying to sleep, tossing and turning.   Next day (Thursday day 2) I felt slightly better, not comfortable enough for real food so I drank plenty of water in small amounts and ate saltines; headache subsided.  I also had more than usual underarm perspiration with a strong unfamiliar odor.    Wednesday, May 19, 2021 1st COVID-19 vaccination shot  It appears the vaccine affected my menstrual cycle.  My period usually lasts for 3-5 days max, usually light blood flow on days 4 and 5. It was a normal light day 5 when I received the vaccine.  After the vaccine, I began having heavy blood flow.  The heavy blood flow is accompanied by blood clots.  In the past I?ve had a blood clot here and there but not like this.  Menstrual blood clots for 9 days after being vaccinated. This is NOT normal for my body.  My period was 14 days. Prior to being vaccinated, I NEVER had a period last this long. To my surprise the vaccine affected my female organs.    I am right handed, so the nurse recommended using my left arm for vaccination.  Left arm where vaccine injected was very sore. Arm pain subsided after 3 days.  Pain soreness tension primarily on my left side, shoulder, upper back, chest area.  There is a shooting pain on left shoulder, down back to breast, chest heart area; pain comes and goes. Heart palpitations?  Experienced this for over a week about 10 days.    Numbness in left hand when I sleep on my left side, wake with my left hand numb. Numbness in both hands when I try to sleep on my back. Numbness in my feet after standing for about 15 minutes. Numbness in my leg and buttocks, primarily left side after sitting for an extended period of time. Before being vaccinated I only experienced numbness in my right foot after being on my feet for an extended period of over 4 hours.  Last year my right foot/heel would began to hurt after being on my feet for an extended period of time (&gt; 4 hours). Then there would be pins and needles sensation.  The solution would be to rest and elevate my feet. I also replaced my shoes (proper support).  Post vaccination even before the time my feet would hurt now my right foot goes numb within 30 minutes of standing even while wearing supportive shoes.  My left butt cheek goes numb when I am sitting with my legs elevated; this was my most comfortable position pre-vaccination.   Since the vaccine my stomach feels upset or unsettled especially in the morning. I am also noticing bloating and more gas than usual. My stomach is also excessively more noisy.    Before the vaccine my stomach would make noises when I was hungry or hadn?t eaten, but now there are so many stomach noises almost nonstop all day and night long all the time   My nose is feeling congested with a slight burn  sensation since getting the vaccination. Immediately after getting the shot my right nostril felt stuffy, congested with a slight burn sensation. This congested feeling comes and goes, especially noticeable when wearing a mask.  Prior to being vaccinated I had not experience this issue even as I have worn multiple masks for over a year with NO stuffy nose.    Saturday, May 29, 2021 (day 10 post vaccination) I get cold symptoms; runny nose and sneezing. I haven?t had a cold in years; I don?t really get colds; if so the symptoms are mild and quickly dissipate. Now my nose has been running pretty much non-stop causing me to blow my nose just as often.  I am also sneezing a lot. This is NOT normal for me.  I drank plenty of liquids; however, running nose and sneezing continued leading to hoarse voice. These symptoms prevented me from sleeping. I don?t know if these are cold or allergy symptoms. I had NO allergies before the vaccine.  These symptoms finally subsided after 3 or 4 days.   My neighbors are waking up in the middle of the night (2am, 3am, 4am, 5am).  I began to wonder if I am waking my neighbors possibly with snoring. I don?t really know, no evidence.   Throat feels winded and dry when talking especially when I try to whisper. I have to drink a lot of water.   Ringing in my ear started In 2019.  I thought this phantom sound went away; however, post vaccination I?m hearing the ringing sound again. It seems worse than before.   2018 diagnosed with eye floaters. I am noticing floaters more since getting the vaccine.  I usually see the eye floaters when going to light from dark. Post vaccination I am noticing the floaters even in dim light; not normal.   I started getting Cold sores in 2006.  I thought I had them somewhat under control. Since the vaccine l keep getting cold sores, this may be due to my menstruation.   Recently within the past year, my shoulder and elbow joints sometimes make this popping sound when I exercise/move my arm. Post vaccination my shoulders and elbows are making the popping sound every time I move my arm. Now sometimes my knees and ankles are also making a popping .

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

While I have had other cardiac dysrhythmias throughout my adult life, this is the first time I have had diagnosed Afib. I took one dose of my PRN Propranalol (10mg) orally after a few minutes of the abnormal rhythm. When it didn&#39;t convert, I did go to the Emergency Department. My heart converted to normal sinus rhythm while on the monitor but before any other interventions were needed. I have a follow up appointment with my cardiologist tomorrow to determine further care as needed.

I called my PCP who ordered an EKG, CXR, COVID swab, a metabolic panel,  a CBC, and a D-dimer. My D-dimer was elevated and he called me to go directly to the emergency department, which I did and had a CTA chest. I was diagnosed with multifocal pulmonary emboli in my right lung with a slight pleural effusion on my left lung. I had a duplex ultrasound of my legs which was negatve for DVT, and an echocardiogram which was within normal limits. I was finally diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism, given a Heparin bolus and started on a Heparin IV infusion. Ultimately, I transitioned to Eliquis PO and was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours.

Patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Patient was seen at the ED for right arm swelling in the setting of receiving her Pfizer COVID vaccine in the right arm 1 week prior. She was found to have a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) in right medial subclavian and superficial thrombosis in right proximal basilic vein. The events started on 17Mar2021 09:00. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient was recovering from the events. Treatment for AEs include anticoagulation.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of subject vaccine cannot be excluded for the DVT and other reported events, based on temporal relationship.  However the reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient. There is very limited information provided in this report.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Vaccine did hit me hard the day after, all day Friday, and managed as many naps as possible but keeping G?s routine going. As the night went on, I found it more difficult to stay awake. I experienced something I have not experienced in almost 20 years. I suffered from a few bouts of sleep paralysis in my 20s. It was horrifying to be awake and unable to move a muscle and you can even make a sound. Last Friday, I literally stopped breathing (never happened b4) and woke up paralyzed just for a few moments and when I regained movement, I was gasping for air. I was so scared because it kept happening shortly after falling asleep but I could not stay awake. I am not sure if my fibromyalgia played a part in this or not.  I have also been experiencing more shortness of breath since then and the last two days constant ear ringing.  It is hard to focus with the high pitch ringing in my ear. I am out of breath with such little movement required.

I called the dr  on Thursday, April 29 and she set up an ultra sound , but I didn?t even mention to her that I had a shot because I hadn?t heard about this happening until I had already spoke with the dr. Also very tired but I think that?s from bleeding so much. Not sure if there?s any way to know for sure if it was caused by the shot but if they do t find anything else wrong with me I?m going to assume it?s from the shot since it seems to be happening to a lot of women

                                                Ischemic Stroke:  I was sick with flu like symptoms the day after my test, including headache, fever, chills, fatigue and body aches. I rested and treated with ibuprofen and tylenol.  The second day after I was well enough to return to normal activities. However, after dinner, my left hand seized up and I had to shake out my hand to get it working again. This event lasted about 30 seconds. I had some small tingling in the evening after that. The next morining when I woke up my left arm was not functioning properly. It was weak, slow and I could not close my hand in a grip.  My husband drove me to the ER where I received many tests over 3 days, resulting in the diagnosis of an ischemic stroke on the right side of my brain.  Most of my arm function returned late afternoon the same day I was admitted.

A 51-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01Apr2021 12:45 (at 51 years old, not pregnant) (Batch/Lot Number: EP7533) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cholesteatoma from an unknown date (Cholesteatoma as a teen--resolved with modified canal-wall down tympanomastoidectomy. No problems since 1989-1990), Allergy to cephalosporins, Sulfa drugs, strawberries, all from an unknown date. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient had her first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot numberEN6204) vaccine on Mar2021 12:45 at 51 years old on left arm for COVID-19 Immunization.The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After the second dose, after about 12 hours (reported also as 09Apr2021 22:00), as expected, patient had moderate to severe muscle and joint pain and a sensation of low electrical shock in limbs. No other symptoms and this resolved in 24 hrs. Eight days after dose 2 (reported also as 09Apr2021 22:00), patient developed hives all over the body which would welt up like measles if patient scratched them. Patient tolerated them for 19 days before patient finally sought help from a doctor, who prescribed a short 20mg/2X/day course of prednisone and hives are improving significantly. However, wherever she scratches these hives on her legs,especially right, she developed bruises and petechiae, which &#34;travel&#34; up and down her thigh corresponding to where she scratches. She was in good health, active, and don&#39;t bruise easily. Bruising has not resolved over about 23 days, but has not gotten worse. Patient has no other symptoms. Perhaps this is a very mild case of thrombocytopenia. The adverse events resulted in visit to Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment received for the adverse events was Prednisone. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. All the events start date was reported as 09Apr2021 22:00 (for clarification). The outcome of the vaccines was recovering.

A 51-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 51-years-old), administered in Deltoid Right (reported as &#34;right upper arm shoulder&#34;) on 07Apr2021 09:45 (Lot Number: EW0150) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome) and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right upper arm shoulder on 17Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The second dose of the vaccine the patient received on 07Apr2021 and she had a great experience with it and nothing happened. Then on 30Apr2021, patient experienced coughing up blood, which required a visit to the Emergency Room. She was admitted in the hospital on 30Apr2021, and they discovered a clot in her lung she is surprised to find out because she is very healthy individual. She had got out of the hospital yesterday (03May2021) for a blood clot in her lungs where the hospital did a bronchoscopy, they cut it out. The blood clot was big and deep. They did a test to see if the blood clot is from her rare disease which it was not so the doctors have no idea what caused the blood clot. She did her research and the only thing that had changed was she got the vaccine and then she also just switched to a different inhaler for her asthma but she has taken it before. The doctors do not think it is any of the two things. The doctor does not know what caused the blood clot and she saw there has been 35 cases reported of a rare blood clot and according to her findings. She was hospitalized for 3 nights (when discovered a clot in her lung) from 30Apr2021 to 03May2021. The blood clot was removed Sunday 02May2021. She had blood work done prior to the vaccine and her count was excellent. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: her count was excellent prior to the vaccine, blood test: it was not (from her rare disease), bronchoscopy: blood clot, electrocardiogram: well, full blood count: well, liver function test: well, thyroid function test: it need to be adjusted: all on unspecified dates. The patient reported that, &#34;hospital where my blood drawn, oh actual testing too many to mention, CBC (complete blood count), ECG (electrocardiogram), Liver function lot of different test. Everything was well except my thyroid it need to be adjusted am taking care of it. It was Saturday prior to the second shot maybe I don&#39;t know.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included bronchoscopy, they cut it out, they did a catheter in upper part of left lung. The outcome of the events was recovered on 02May2021. There were no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No adverse events following prior vaccinations.

                                                As I stated previously, I received the first shot on 01/05/2021.  One week after I got sick and had a covid test which came back negative.  Then  I got the second vaccine on 02/05/2021. On Feb 14,2021 I woke up at 1:00 am and had severe back pain.  Within about 10 mins the pain shot to my chest.  I went to the emergency room.  My troponin level continued to elevate and I was admitted for 2 days.  I had a cardiac catherization and all my arteries were completely clear.  It was later determined that I had a non stemi MI.  There was swelling around my pericardium of the heart.  Following this event I have also been having shortness of breath and also seeing a pulmonologist.  The pulmonologist believes the lung issue is related to my initial heart problem, from Feb 14,2021.  I am currently being treated for viral asthma.  I am on two inhalers, and a round of prednisone as of May 25,2021.  I have never had any health issues prior to these events.  I do not know for sure that the events are related to the vaccine but it certainly is a coincidence that everything started happening after I was vaccinated.

It hurt most when I bent over and when I laid down.  I got an appt to see my PCP on Jan 21, she had no idea what was going on but scheduled me for a CT for Jan 22.  I never made the CT appt because on the evening of Thursday, Jan 21, I began having an erratic heartbeat and thought I was having a heart attack.  I went to the emergency department and they found that I was in AFIB.  I have never had AFIB before or since this.  I was kept overnight and had many tests run.  I saw my cardiologist days after and was told that I likely had pericarditis due to my symptom of pain when bending and laying down.    I have never had pericarditis or AFIB before or since then.

                                                The patient had mild vaginal spotting the day after her first Pfizer Covid shot (4-15-21) which lasted 1 day.  She gave it no mind.  But upon getting her second shot, she had several days of light spotting and reported to my office on 5-11-21 for an exam.  Bacterial vaginitis was diagnosed at that visit.  The patient wants this event reported, in case this is a legitimately linked event.

                                                while waiting the 30 minutes after the injection. i started feeling sharp pain in the heart area and asked the nurse if this was normal. they took my pressure and vitals and had me sit longer to see how i felt. The sharp pain went away but i felt pressure on the left chest area. I thought i was fine since the shooting pain was gone. The nurse said to go to the ER if the sympotms persisted. I felt tired the following 2 days with pressure on the chest. Monday 4/5 i felt more pressure and pain on the left neck and left upper back shoulder and called the triage nurse and said go to the E.R not urgent care.

                                                Heart attack / she had a MI / diagnosed as a NSTEMI; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). This 52-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in left arm, on 07Jan2021, for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis) from 1998 and vitiligo from 1988. She was overweight. She had really no other risk factors. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced heart attack and she had a MI, then a cardiac catherization that was normal and a normal echo as well. She said it was diagnosed as a NSTEMI and not a large MI, the smaller version. These events required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 12Jan2021. MI occurred after she finished clinic and she was not standing or doing anything, just sitting and she had chest pain. Her office was right next to the ER, so she received treatment within an hour and they were able to help her. She said that her hospital couldn&#39;t do a cardiac cath, so on 11Jan2021 they moved her to an hospital which was another treatment facility. When she had her MI they gave her acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and sublingual nitroglycerin. They tested her troponin and did an EKG which was abnormal on an unspecified date in Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 troponin was increased. When they treated her with nitroglycerin and Aspirin, two hours later her EKG was normal and her troponin came down overnight on 09Jan2021, which was when they said for sure that she had a heart attack. The patient said it was very scary to have a heart attack, but thankfully there was not a lot of damage done and she was able to get treatment quickly. She did not think the event was disabling since they did not see much damage to her heart muscle, it was a near miss kind of thing. She said it was life changing in that she will now be on medication forever, she will be on at least a baby Aspirin and probably something like a statin for the rest of her life. She was recovering, it was unknown what the lasting effects may be, she felt normal but tired from her hospital stay. Heart attack resolved on 08Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event acute myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. The contributory role of the patient age and background of obesity cannot be excluded as well.

This 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EK5730) at single dose on left arm on 23-Dec-2020 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Concomitant Medication was nothing new, her normal medication, she took vitamins, and high blood pressure medication. She had had no positive test for Covid prior to the vaccine, she had had no antibody test, she had had no issues with vaccine in the past. The patient experienced left arm swelling in Jan2021 and pneumonia on 08Jan2021. The patient worked in a hospital and received her first dose on 23Dec2020 and she was supposed to get the second dose today but she was not at work today. She was wanting to know if she should go ahead and take the second dose because her arm was still swollen. The product was the Covid vaccine. She stated that her arm was still swollen, when she got shot she was fine, her arm was sore that evening (Dec2020) and then nothing, then a weekend after new years her arm and shoulder became swollen (Jan2021) and she had been to the ER and the doctor thought the swelling was because of the shot, but she also had something else going on in her shoulder (Jan2021). So in the meantime she went to the ER and they took X rays, and they told her that she was starting to develop pneumonia. She was going back to work tomorrow, being that she was on the antibiotics now, still had swelling in the arm, and had pneumonia, should she still get the 2nd shot. She noticed the swelling Saturday after New Years. She was also achy all over in her neck, arm, and shoulder (Jan2021). She felt sick to her stomach, this was all the first Week of Jan2021. She went to the ER, she was not admitted and came home the same day. She went to the ER on 08Jan2021. 08Jan2021 was also when the pneumonia was diagnosed. The name of antibiotic she was prescribed was doxycycline. She started it on Saturday 09Jan2021, she was prescribed 100 mg 2 pills a day for 10 days. When they did the X ray, they said that the pneumonia had showed up, or she was just starting to get pneumonia. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t believe because they made a comment about the way she was laying however she had been taking the medication and feeling better.

Within the next 5 - 10 minutes she became SOB with respirations 40 per minute.  She was taken to Medical Center and seen by 10:45 - 11:00 am.  She was treated for anaphylaxis and was worked up for any other underlying problems.  She had to be put on the vent due to acute respiratory failure.   She was negative for COVID, pulmonary emboli and pneumonia.  As her status declined, ED felt she needed higher acuity care.  She was over the weight limit to be airlifted so she was transported by critical care ambulance to hospital where she is in ICU and on ventilator.

                                                On Friday 4/16/21 evening, I had my left tonsil spontaneously rupture without any provocation. I was not eating or drinking but felt like I had something in my throat. I coughed it into a tissue, and it was a blood clot the size of a nickel. My tonsil had 2 places that it was oozing blood and continued to bleed for about 1.5 hours. It eventually tapered off and the redness/bruising disappeared over the next 48 hours. There was no pain, no warning - just a mouth full of blood. The tonsil that ruptured was on the same side as where I received the injection and I had swollen lymph nodes under my arm on that same side until Sunday 4/18. I can&#39;t help but think it was related to the vaccine as I had no other cold/hay fever/allergy symptoms of any kind to explain a bleeding tonsil.

A 52-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration at the age 52-year-old on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hemodialysis for many years, adherent to medical care, multiple DVTs and Pes (On anticoagulants), morbid obesity, Patient was on dialysis for renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant (positive), Afib, allergic to shellfish. Family history included renal failure and had lupus anticoagulant. Concomitant medications included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN); metoprolol; amitriptyline; calcitriol; ergocalciferol (VIT D); calcium; calcium acetate (PHOSLO); amiodarone; albuterol. The patient previously allergic to Cipro, clindamycin, doxycyclin, Lyrica, tetracycline. The patient previously was non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient hasn&#39;t been treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient wasn&#39;t smoker/ former smoker. There was no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. A nephrologist who reported patient in her hemodialysis unit who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 but were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. More detail is below on each patient. The patient COVID results were sent to the local health department for genetic sequencing (pending) and SARS titers were drawn (pending). Unfortunately, the HD unit does not have B/L information (although the B/L # was put on the patient&#39;s COVID vaccine cards, a record was not kept in the HD unit). Day she came in for dialysis she was already short of breath she said she&#39;d had body aches for 5 days, got short of breath on 05Apr2021. The day before, started getting cough, nauseous, chills, abdominal discomfort on 04Apr2021. The patient was sent to the ER from dialysis and was admitted for SOB on 05Apr2021 and passed away on 09Apr2021 due to a GI bleed. Patient is over 500lbs so was unable to fit into hospital imaging equiment for CT scans or weight measurements. COVID-19 test was positive on 05Apr2021; the patient experienced COVID pneumonia on 05Apr2021. The patient admitted on 05Apr2021 to regular floor. The patient was moved to an Intensive Care Unit on 06Apr2021. The patient experienced short of breath on 05Apr2021 and required much more O2 than normal. Sometimes required BP support while on Dialysis and BP was 113/61 in ER. Pressure dropped to 100/70 and required mitrodrine after fluid was removed. The patient needed 4 liters supplemental O2 vs. only needing 2 liters at home. The patient experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia and no Respiratory failure. Respiration was 22. After 5 litres of O2 improved. Pulse 93 in ER. Cardiovascular: There was no heart failure, cardiogenic shock, Acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and myocarditis. The patient Had chest pain which resolved when O2 was administered. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic: There was no Vomiting, Diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea and complained of abdominal pain. There was no Jaundice and acute liver failure. Neurological: There was no altered consciousness, altered consciousness, encephalopathy, meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. The patient had headaches a couple days before admitting to ER. Hematological: There was no Thrombocytopenia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. INR was 3 due to large dose of coumadin, and platelets were 180 and white count 6.8. Slight troponin increased at 0.37 at admittance, BNP 39. The patient started coughing up blood, having hemoxysis and bleeding on unspecified date. Laboratory test or diagnostic studies was reported that test for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or other commercial or public health assay. Xray showed vascular congestion with superimposed infiltrate which could represent pneumonia. Blood count was 11 and 36.7% at ER. Clinical chemistry: Sodium was 133; BUN was 68; Creatinine was 10. Evidence of hypoxemia: Pulse oO2 was 90 in ER.  CT scans: unknown results. Urinalysis: On dialysis so does not make urine. The patient had received Remdesivir, from 06Apr2021, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Azithromycin from 06Apr2021 and Corticosteroids from 06Apr2021 for COVID-19.  The outcome of event &#34;GI bleed&#34; was fatal, the event &#34;chest pain&#34; and &#34;body aches&#34; was recovered and other events was unknown. The patient died on 09Apr2021. An autopsy was not performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect drug cannot be excluded for the events vaccination failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis. However, the patient&#39;s multiple medical comborbidities including renal failure requiring dialysis, lupus, and morbid obesity along with the risk of COVID-19 infection in light of the current pandemic are the more likely explanations for the development of these infections. The events gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage, hemolysis and troponin increased are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, and are considered unrelated to the suspect drug. The patient is currently on warfarin which may increase the risk for bleeds. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: GI bleed

                                                TIA; a rush of numbness came over my whole left arm. My arm; My arm was numb, heavy and weak; My arm was numb, heavy and weak; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EN6208, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Mar2021 (at the age of 52-years-old), 8:00am at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 88mg and lisdexamfetamine mesylate (VYVANSE) 40mg both taken from unknown dates and unknown indication. The patient previously took clarithromycin (MACROBID) and experienced allergies. Historical vaccine included first dose BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer) received on 24Feb2021 6:00pm (lot number: EN6202) at the age of 52-years-old in the left arm. It was reported that on Thursday, 08Apr2021 at approximately 7:00pm, the patient was standing in her kitchen when all of a sudden, a rush of numbness came over her whole left arm. The patient&#39;s arm was numb, heavy, and weak. She knew that this feeling was not normal, so she had her husband take her to the hospital, their local hospital. They arrived at approximately 7:30pm where the patient was took in right away. At that time, the feeling had returned to the patient&#39;s arm. The patient was taken back for a CAT scan on her head after which the doctor came to tell her that they would be keeping her overnight for observation since they think she had TIA (transient ischaemic attack). The patient was monitored overnight and at 6am the next day on 09Apr2021, she had an ultrasound on her carotid artery and later in the morning, at around 10am, the patient had an echo cardiogram. The patient was released at approximately 12pm on Friday, 09Apr2021. The events experienced resulted in &#34;Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and Hospitalization from 08Apr2021 to 09Apr2021&#34;. The patient has no COVID prior vaccination and had not tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of all the events was recovering.

Medical history included retinoblastoma, menorrhagia and fibroids from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, norgestrel (OGESTREL-28) taken for menorrhagia, uterine leiomyoma; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop dates for both were not reported. On 03Apr2021, the patient woke up with slight pain in right calf. On 04Apr2021, she woke up with severe pain in right calf (unable to weight bear), then went to Urgent Care and was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 7cm. Started apixaban (ELIQUIS) for 3 months, stopped low norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event. The outcome of the event was recovering.

A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 05Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151) as single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome and ongoing lupus. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  07Apr2021, she started having a nose bleed. She explains she wasn&#39;t doing anything in particular, just talking on the phone, and blood just started pouring out of her nose. Blood clots started coming out as well. She ended up calling 911 and they sent an ambulance. The EMS helped her stop the bleeding. She didn&#39;t go to the ER or anything. However, she is getting implants done for her upper teeth so she wanted to double check and make sure nothing was pressing against her nasal cavity because the nose bleeds were so off/random. The doctor said there was no pushing. The doctor completed a panoramic exam/x-ray and confirmed there was nothing pushing. The doctor did suggest she go to the ENT. She made an appointment with an ENT doctor for the following day, 08Apr2021, and the ENT put a camera down. She confirms she explained to them she just had the vaccine and she was googling information. She was told to not google anything and to let them check it out.  The caller states she explained to the ENT the reason she was there was because she was concerned, she is not a nose bleeder and nose bleeds never happened to her. Once blood clots started coming out that way, she was terrified. They didn&#39;t see anything alarming, but they wanted to make sure and do further research, so basically they planned to do a CT/CAT scan. She was scheduled for a CT/CAT scan on Monday, 12Apr2021, but she was allergic to the contrast and was sent home because they were not prepared for pre-medication. She is waiting for the doctor to schedule another appointment so she can go back. She felt she needed to report these nose bleeds because she has been seeing Johnson &amp; Johnson had severe blood clots, but she took Pfizer&#39;s vaccine, and was also getting blood clots. Her nose bleeds just happened right after both vaccines. On an unspecified date, she had a little bump that went away. She had this big bump on her arm and a big rash developed. At first, the bump was the size of a quarter and then grew double in size. The bump finally went down, but the rash she can still see. The rash hasn&#39;t grown, it&#39;s just there- there is just a red blotch on her arm. She has not had another nose bleed since the one that occurred on 07Apr2021. She just noticed when she had her first dose on 15Mar2021, the nose bleed happened within that week also. The outcome of events was unknown.

Pt received Pfizer vaccine #1 on 4/29.

At the point where I had to go to the hospital was 3 days later. I broke out in a rash of pinprick blood spots all over my body.  immune thrombocytopenia Where my blood platelets dropped. I looked like I was bleeding under my skin. My blood count dropped by at least 200-300. It was not so bad that I had to have a transfusion. It started me into a downward spiral of all my autoimmune system flaring. My dermatomyositis has really heightened. Up my neck, into my face was a deep red/scarlet. I felt like it triggered a flare in all my autoimmune issues. It took about 4 weeks from there for me to get better but months later, I have not regained the level of health I had prior to 3/15, when I received the vaccine. Last month I began taking a new immunosuppressant drug.   I have pictures of the pinprick rash that appeared on my body.

                                                On April 28th I received my shot, within 2 days of that I started to break out in a rash down both arms and legs. A couple days later my breathing got more complicated. When I have my face mask on it&#39;s already hard to breath, but when I take my face mask off I still can&#39;t breath normally. The doc sent me for a CTA of my lungs on May 11th when they noticed I had multiple blood clots in my lungs. I ended up in the hospital on May 11th and started blood thinners the very next day. On or about the day of the vaccine, the rash started. The doctors put me on a dose pack and I had to stop taking my chemo for 3 days while on the steroid dose pack. The rash did go away by May 11th, but I still have the scabs from itching the rashes. On May 12th I started to get a sharp pain in my head that lasted for about a week. The doctors told me to get my 2nd shot. They wanted me to start the dose pack the morning of getting the 2nd shot in the afternoon.  That vaccine was three weeks to the date of my 1st vaccine. I didn&#39;t want to get the 2nd dose because of the reactions to the 1st dose, but I only got it to see my kids to get on a plane. The reaction after my second vaccine was a little worse. My arms got really itchy and my breathing got worse.

                                                reddened area with bruising with nodule; reddened area with bruising with nodule; numbness and tingling in right thumb; numbness and tingling in right thumb; EKG abnormal; large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm; Chest discomfort; Heart attack; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Jan2021 (at the age of 53-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient experienced electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormal and large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm on 08Jan2021; numbness and tingling in right thumb on 10Jan2021; reddened area with bruising with nodule on 26Jan2021; chest discomfort and heart attack in Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: Two days later after vaccination, she noticed bruising on various parts of body. The first bruise she noticed on the 08Jan2021. It was probably about 3.5 inches in length 2 inches in width. The patient stated that it did not necessarily have a shape. She had a large bruise on her right buttock. Two days later, she noticed a similar in size bruise on the front of her right thigh. Then a couple days later, she noticed three quarter size bruises on her right arm (two on the inner part of arm, and one on the outer, both on upper arm). The very next day, she developed the same sizing bruise. It was about the same size on her left upper arm. There were no other side effects besides the bruising. There was no itching or redness, no skin, respiratory, or neurological issues. The day before her second dose, on 26Jan2021, she noticed a 4 inch reddened area with a two centimeter nodule inside that bruise. The patient stated that the initial bruises began to heal. They are not as dark as they were. They were reported to have started out red and then turned black and blue. The patient also had numbness and tingling in her right thumb. She was having some chest discomfort after the initial vaccination that is still ongoing. The chest discomfort prompted her to go to urgent care on 08Jan2021, where she had an abnormal EKG on 08Jan2021. The patient was told to follow up with a cardiologist. The patient saw the cardiologist on 25Jan2021, where he did an EKG and ECHO. The EKG was abnormal and ECHO with unknown results on 25Jan2021, but the doctor was unable to determine when the heart attack occurred. The cardiologist also ran labs: a troponin to see if anything was acutely going on, and a D Dimer to evaluate her clotting factors; both were negative on 25Jan2021. The cardiologist recommended a computerised tomogram (CT) scan, which was still scheduled at the time of report. The clinical outcome of large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm, chest discomfort, numbness and tingling in right thumb, and reddened area with bruising with nodule was not recovered and of heart attack and EKG abnormal was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I received the first covid vaccine on 1/4/21 and the 2nd on 1/25/21.  On Feb 22nd I started having heavy vaginal bleeding and severe stomach cramps.  These continued for 9 days and then I went to the Emergency department because I felt like my HGB was low.  They checked it and it was 11.3 and did an abd US that showed my endometrium was thick.  They recommended follow up with GYN and a biopsy.  I continued to have significant bleeding and cramps until the next week when I called the nurse line and they set me up with a virtual visit with GYN provider.  She started me on progesterone and scheduled a hysteroscopy and D &amp; C for the following week.  The progesterone slowed the bleeding down but I continued to experience abd cramps.  I had the D &amp; C and after getting home started to have heavy bleeding and bad cramps again.  The following week I called the GYN provider and she had me come in for another Abd US and checked my HGB which was 9.3.  She also checked for infection and other labs which were all within nml range.  The pathology from my D &amp; C was neg and the GYN really was not worried that is was anything other than a period but was surprised that it was lasting so long.  She gave me TXA and after 5 days on that the bleeding has now stopped but I am still having bad cramps in my lower abd and a lot of bloating.  Also having lots of jolting pains in lower abd.  I have never had  periods that were anything like this and never really had bad cramps like this before.

A 53-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection) dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 23Mar2021 (Lot number and Expiry date was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ischemic colitis in the past and she thinks that maybe the cramping started triggering it again. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 02Apr2021 strong cramps in her stomach (stomach flu-like symptoms) and on an unspecified date, the patient experienced the contractions and cramping sensation went trough out her entire chest region and her back (like heart attack symptoms), in the left arm it was cold and tingling (vaccination site coldness), (paraesthesia), experiencing contractions and cramping in her arm and the left side of her torso in the ribcage area that continued for 24 hours (muscle spasms) and diarrhoea on the weekend. Her second dose is scheduled on 13Apr2021, she would like to know if there are recommendations for her second dose because she heard that with the second dose the side effects are worse, she would like to know if someone else has reported these symptoms. She would like to know if she should possibly receive the vaccine in her thigh instead of her arm and if that would be helpful. The outcome of the events diarrhoea was recovered on 05Apr2020 and outcome of contractions and cramping sensation went trough out her entire chest region and her back (like heart attack symptoms) was not recovered and rest of the events was unknown.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested

                                                I have an IUD (I&#39;ve had it for 3 years - no trouble) for controlling my fibroids and have not had a period or any bleeding for 3 years. 3 days after my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, I experienced very heavy bleeding which was a bright red color. The next day, (4 days after my first dose), I experienced very strong (the strongest I&#39;ve ever felt) cramping and a very large piece of uterine lining expelled from my body. Again, very bright red color. I just received my 2nd dose on 4/22/21 and am waiting to see if I have bleeding and/or cramping again.

                                                On the morning of Saturday, March 13th my mother had a CARDIAC ARREST,  luckily i was with her when this happened and called 911 immediately and followed an emergency/cpr protocol.  She had no pulse when the emergency team arrived and they used the defibrillator on her three times in our house before they took her in the ambulance where they used the defibrillator another time.  She was rushed to the Hospital where she was sedated and put on a breathing machine.  It did not seem as if she would survive,  the entire morning was a whirlwind and traumatizing.  In the afternoon they transferred her to the ICU unit.  Luckily after 24 hours they lowered sedation and she had no brain injury etc.,  we were all amazed she was alive. The doctors ran tests etc. to find out what caused this cardiac arrest event,  they found NOTHING - no blood clot, no clogged arteries,  nothing that could have caused this.  My mother also has had not health conditions before this that would have caused this.  She now has a defibrillator implanted and her life will never be the same,  her families either,  we will constantly worry.  I have post traumatic stress from witnessing my mother turn purple and lifeless right in front of my eyes and the emergency team working on her all morning and in the ER. Thank gosh i was with her that morning and that the emergency team arrived within a few minutes or else my mother would not be here today.   The only thing that changed leading up to her Cardiac Arrest was that she got the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 24th - we need answers,  did the vaccine have anything to do with this?

                                                cardiac arrest; on the ground turning purple and lifeless/ immediate risk of death from the event; she had no pulse; on the ground turning purple and lifeless; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer. A 53-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6200), administered in left arm on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 53-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was reported as other. The patient was not pregnant. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not had COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. It was reported that on 13Mar2021 08:15 exactly 17 days after reporter&#39;s mother received her first Pfizer vaccine she had a cardiac arrest, luckily reporter was with her when this happened and he/she called immediately and followed the steps of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) etc. When the emergency team arrived she had no pulse and they used the defibrillator on her 4 times. The entire day they did not know if she would survive. She was sedated and tested, they got the news that she had survived and there was not brain damage. The doctors had no clue what the cardiac arrest was caused by, she had no prior health conditions and the tests show nothing to what could have caused this event (no blood clots, no clogged arteries etc.). The only thing that changed leading up to the event was her receiving her first vaccine. Luckily reporter was there when this happened or else she would in fact be dead. She now had a defibrillator implanted and reporter had a post-traumatic stress from the traumatic event and witnessing his/her mom on the ground turning purple and lifeless. They need answers. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The events were reported as serious since resulted in hospitalization and life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatments were received for the events and they were reported as multiple lifesaving treatments, tests, and defibrillator implant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedure which included COVID test (negative) on unspecified date post vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved for the event &#34;she had no pulse&#34; and resolved with sequel (reported as recovered with lasting effects) for all other events.

A 53-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 at 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not unknown; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), at age of 53 year-old, as 0.3 mL single, for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver disease from 2016 and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose on 17Mar2021 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced fever. The patient received her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 07Apr2021 and reports having side effects after. She is specifically worried about the leg pain that she is experiencing and would like to know if it is possible that it could be related to a blood clot and if she needs to be worried about it. She stated that with the &#34;swollen joints&#34; and everything from the vaccine, it is possible that it worsened her back condition and may have &#34;pinched a nerve or something.&#34; She describes it as the worst pain she&#39;s ever felt in her life and states it &#34;comes out of the blue&#34; so she does not have time to prepare for it. She likens it to a &#34;Charley horse&#34; but a &#34;really bad one&#34; that goes away and has no pain afterwards. She states she is scheduled for an MRI next week of her lower back to investigate. The patient also mentions that she thinks she had COVID-19 at the time of her vaccine because &#34;when I got the shot, I had a super strong response.&#34; On 07Apr2021, the patient had body aches, chills, she was on the couch for quite a while. The joint pain was incredible, even in her toes. She felt like she had a horrible flu. Her every muscles and every joint hurt, and her head hurt. She was on the couch for like 4 days. On day 3 or 4 she developed intermittent pain in the leg and shin on 08Apr2021. It feels like someone is drilling a jackhammer in it. It feels like a Charley&#39;s horse, but not, more like it&#39;s in the bone. She didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine at first, even though she had never had this pain before until she got the vaccine. She said that she has had some back problems and scheduled a MRI to see if she had pinched nerve or something. On 08Apr2021, she also has some tingling on the skin. She read about side effects of blood clots and doesn&#39;t know if this leg pain could be related to a blood clot. She assumed it could be from her back. She read that with blood clots there is usually an ache and discoloration, which she does not have now. She also read that intermittent Charley&#39;s horse could have something to do with blood clots. She has pins and needles on the skin. She also had a headache after the vaccine, but she does not have it now. She said that the pain in her leg that shoots on and bangs in her tibia hurts when bending over, lifting her leg to her chest, squatting to pick up something, and going up and down the stairs. She said that the pain is horrible and it is worse than leg pain, it is worse than a charley horse, it is the worst pain she has ever felt in her life. She cannot stop screaming when it happens. States with the joint pain that she had, there may be a nerve that&#39;s being pressed on her back. She said that with all of the information being reported in the news about blood clots, she asked is that something she needs to be concerned about. She said that she did a virtual visit with her doctor and notified her of the leg pain and asked the doctor to schedule her for an MRI because of the pain. She stated her hemoglobin and hematocrit, MCV are high.  She also said that the clotting is affecting her red blood cells. She ran a fever with the first vaccine, but she had a high fever between 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit after the second vaccine that stopped on 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021. Her high fever lasted for about 3 days. She had a low grade fever that lasted for about a week. Her body aches resolved completely on 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021. Her joint pain is in her back and elbows. She also had lot of joint pain in her shoulder and arm and radiates to her neck on the left side. She still has some muscle pain in her leg, but overall her muscle pain is gone. For treatment she used Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth and fluids. The day before her shot, her son called and told her he tested positive for covid. She got a PCR test immediately on 07Apr2021 and the next day she was told it was negative. She thinks she might have tested too soon. She also says her response to it was so strong, she must have been getting covid and didn&#39;t know it. She might have tested negative because she had the first shot already. She wasn&#39;t worried about exposing others and went to get her second shot, but she got really sick after that and it kicked her butt pretty hard. The outcome of the events for leg pain and tingling on skin was not recovered, fever, body aches and headache recovered in Apr2021, chills on 11Apr2021, muscle hurt/pain on 12Apr2011, joint pain was recovering, and outcome of other events was unknown.

After 30 minutes, I told the head nurse that I was going to drive home as it didn&#39;t seem to be progressing further than a bit of cough and some very minimal itching. By the time I got to my car, it was a bit worse and I opted to just try to get home for a cold shower and Benadryl. After 10 minutes of driving, I turned around and went back to hospital with a full blown anaphylactic reaction -- throat closing, gasping for breath, unable to talk due to coughing. Nurse walked me through the hospital to the ER where I was given epinephrine injection in Rt thigh &amp; 25 my Benadryl in Rt arm about an hour after vaccination.

She was asking if she can take an alternative vaccine for her 2nd dose (Moderna) or she needs to stop. She needed to know how to move forward for dose 2. She needed hospitalizing and it was to the point she needed to call 911 but it resolved and materialized at home. She clarified that instead of going to the hospital it was a close call at home. She said she used her rescue inhaler because she was an asthma person. She used her rescue inhaler over the course of a few days and it resulted in settling the issue. It lasted several days. She needed to also submit a safety report over to VAERS. She wanted to submit over there as well, online or call in.  Her question was she had a really bad case and nearly had to go to the ER and thought she would die with dose 1, she waned  to know if she should get dose 2.

She wants to know what&#39;s in the Pfizer vaccine, asking what are in the ingredients. Right now, she has one vaccine in the system. She wanted to know how effective is it to prevent her from catching covid. How much protection does she have from one dose. The lady just read the statement to her that people who are immunocompromised she was told something that it would have a lower effect with the vaccine. She would like to file an official report with VAERS she wants to receive the information she needs about the vaccine through Pfizer and move forward. She contacted the CDC and usually with adverse effects Pfizer uses the reports of the vaccine. If she has need or medical assistance needed or she doesn&#39;t know reimbursement billing. If a medical fee was incurred. She said she had to get a chest x-ray on an unknown date with unknown result and it was an emergency she had to go to the doctor which was a medical expense. She wanted to know if she will be refunded. There is compensation on the FDA&#39;s website. On the website from the CDC that says Pfizer has compensation for reaction for the shot for medical expenses. She was informed that she would have to submit a written request to the legal department by mail. She repeatedly asked for a direct phone number for the legal department. She stated her lawyer would not know how to file the claim she would be mailing to them and asked if there is a website to know how to file the claim. Her legal papers. She stated Pfizer cannot be sued they are covered by the government. She wanted to know how effective is it to prevent her from catching covid and stated &#34;the lady just read the statement that people who are immunocompromised have a lower effect with the vaccine&#34;. The event was reported as medically significant and life-threatening and patient stated that it had caused her for a physician visit.

When I went home, I couldn&#39;t walk. I saw my doctor. They said I had a horrible reaction to the vaccine. I was still sick a week later. I called my doctor again. I went back to the hospital for another X-Ray. They told me had I had deflated air pockets in my lungs.   My doctor thought I had pneumonia. I was prescribed two inhalers. The combination of both inhalers provided some relief. I take a lot of supplements to try to give myself relief as well. I still get really winded most days - its sometimes difficult to walk up the stairs, walk to the parking lot, or move around at work &amp; most places. I&#39;m going back to the doctor in July.

                                                I developed pain up and down my right arm quite suddenly, basically from the shoulder all the way in to my wrist and fingers off and on, it got progressively worse it was very painful, I went to the doctor and they ordered an ultrasound to ruled out a blood clot. They had to do the ultrasound on the ER and they found a clot in my basilic vein. They gave me a pain med so I could sleep and add heat and Ibuprofen. I am being referred to another doctor because the pain is coming back and they are going to do more tests. I have donated blood about a month before I had the vaccine and the ER doctor thought this may be because of that.

Still having issues; other vaccine same date product received; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 54-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on right arm at 12:30 PM on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization, and first dose of other Pfizer vaccine same date product (other vaccine same date lot number: elt9899) on right deltoid on 18Dec2020 for unknown indication. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medication included vitamin C and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D). The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction at 12:30 PM on 18Dec2020 requiring two doses of epinephren to control. still having issues, resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Hospitalization in Dec2020. days hospitalization: 1.

Lot/Batch and Expiration date has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and anecdotal and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment of the case. There is a plausible temporal association between vaccines administration and onset of the reported event. It is unclear what is the nature of the vaccine co-administered with BNT162b2. Currently no information is available on the co-administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with other vaccines.

About 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, my throat felt strange, my sinuses started getting congested, my ears started plugging.  I felt dizzy when walking.  I spent extra time at the clinic under observation.  About 40 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly felt like I was being sucked into a vacuum and thought I was going to pass out.  I alerted the nurses, who checked my vital signs and put me on O2.  My heart rate was normal, my BP was high, my O2 sat was 100%.  After about 5 minutes I started to feel normal, they removed the O2.  They continued to observe me for another 15 minutes, until I felt better.  As I drove home (about 1 hour 10 min after receiving the vaccine), my face and lips became numb.  I continued driving home and the numbness resolved in about 10-15 minutes.  I notified my doctor of the event and she advised me not to get the second dose and to report the event.

My husband was making breakfast.  I came downstairs, ate, had a cup of coffee, then got a glass of water and an ice pack and sat on a recliner in the living room.  I don&#39;t remember much of the rest.  It was like a dream.  My husband said I let out a yell, my arms flailed and my eyes were very strange.  I lost muscle strength in my lift side mimicking a stroke.  He called 911.  I was taken to Emergency facility where I gained consciousness.  I was then transferred to Hospital.  So far every test has come back negative.  I have an EEG scheduled for this Thursday.

                                                increased AFib episodes; joint ache esp to left knee with pain; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 54-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 28Jan2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 54-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib), depression, aortic stenosis and allergy to sulfa, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included losartan, HCTZ, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), vitamin D3, magnesium and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12).  The patient previously took LEVOQUIN and prednisone and experienced allergies. On 02Feb2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced increased AFib episodes, joint ache esp. to left knee with pain and headache.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 (nasal swab) test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included acupuncture and the events required physician office visit. The patient outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event atrial fibrillation is related to BNT162B2.  The event only occurred 4 days after vaccination.  And the patient had underlying atrial fibrillation, which is considered the most likely cause of the reported event.

                                                After the first vaccine on 2/6/2021,  I did not have any reaction except a sore arm until 2/10/2021 when developed a bad headache causing me to leave work.  When I awoke on 2/11/21 I felt worse as the day went on until I had complete flu like symptoms.  On Friday, 2/12, I went to my primary care doctor and they did a COVID-19 test which was negative.  Hence, I just waited for the reaction to go away,  I was not better and able to resume normal activity until 2/15/21.  I did decide to get the second shot as I was not entirely sure it was a result of the vaccine. On 2/27/2021, I received the second vaccination.  Again, the immediate side effect was only a sore arm. On the following Monday (3/1/2021) see cont.I began to have what I thought was muscle aches and pains around the mid section on my body but they were manageable.  On Tuesday and Wednesday (3/3/2021) the pain and area of the pain spread and intensified.  I was unable to sleep or find a comfortable position and was losing strength and knew I needed medical attention as I was afraid it was a heart issue.  My husband took me to the ER (3/4/2021).  The ER doctor ran a CT scan with contrast and the result was a blood clot in my right lung and pneumonia in my left lung along with pleurisy. I was then admitted to Clinic on 3/4/2021.  I remained in the hospital until 3/7/2021.  There I was treated with IV antibiotics, warfarin, Lovenox (80mg), and pain medication for the pleurisy. I was also on a full time heart monitor and my heart was checked several times. Since returning home, I finished a dose of two antibiotics and am using an inhaler to help with breathing.  I have also just finished a long dose of steriods.  My INR is still not regulated to the therapeutic level.  Prior to this reaction, I was in the therapeutic range and had been checked.  As of 4/3/2021 I am at 1.8 not in the 2-3 range and have increased my dose from before the reaction at 7.5 mg to 9.0 mg daily.

He tried waking me and I didn&#39;t wake right away.  He got up, turned on the light, noticed that I had wet the bed and he continued to shake me and called my name several times, then I opened my eyes.  My speech was a bit slurred at first, I got out of bed, felt nauseous, and my ears were ringing very loudly.  I sat up for a while, then went back to bed.  I didn&#39;t connect it to the vaccine, but wondered about the connection.  Then I heard it happened to someone else, so I thought I should report it.  I did not seek medical care.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her husband. This is the first of two reports.  A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 54 years of age), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right on 10Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe asthma which started as a child and then it went away and then as an adult it got severe around 2010 and ongoing, she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She had ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), brain surgery in 2007, low immune system, allergies to cephalosporins, pulmonary and stomach issues; and bradycardia (as her BP usually runs 90/45 and she is bradycardic). Concomitant medications included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR HFA), salbutamol (VENTOLIN [SALBUTAMOL]), and montelukast (MONTELUKAST), all taken for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN], omeprazole, phenytoin sodium, azelastine, ipratropium bromide, fluticasone propionate (FLONASE [FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE]), and ipratropium bromide, salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; prednisone taken for an unspecified indication from 2021 and ongoing as she was on this steroid 2 weeks before the vaccine; and  azithromycin which she takes prophylactically for her low immune system from an unspecified start date and ongoing. She was on a lot of medications period and most are for her pulmonary and stomach issues. The patient previously took propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, and Percocet wherein the patient had drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic shock with these; adhesive from nicotine patch made her arm to get red and swollen (Dermatitis contact). She previously took EpiPen for anaphylaxis. It was reported that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She got her vaccine at a hospital in their clinic and she was transferred from the vaccine clinic to the ER. Stated she was given a shot with an Epi-pen in her thigh at the clinic and transferred to the ER. In the ER, she was given Benadryl and watched for 4 hours. She would state this was medically significant because of airway, breathing, circulation and she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She added that it was kind of weird and freaky. She mentioned that along with that, shortly before she was released from the ER, she experienced a very sore arm where she was given the injection. She heard that was very common so she dealt with it. However as the night progressed, it got increasingly worse, it almost felt like she was punched several times in her arm. It probably started between hour 3 and 4 after receiving the vaccine. She added that she had a very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.  It was not serious, just annoying and it was gone 3 days later. She had injection site bruising on 10Mar2021. She stated that she knows this because she was a nurse, but a lot of times, people experienced this reaction when they are given Dilaudid wherein they  get a warm feeling in their chest, so they push it really slow and dilute it with saline so it doesn&#39;t have the respiratory factor. She stated that this was kind of what the feeling was like for her and it was scary because she didn&#39;t expect it. She stated that the ER team that assessed her said, because she wasn&#39;t used to that feeling, she may have had a panic attack and that may have made it worse. After she was treated, she spoke with her husband and he had the shot two minutes before her and he had the same feeling but he didn&#39;t freak out and didn&#39;t want to appear weak. Stated he told her he had the same feeling and it lasted 5 minutes and then it went away. Stated since she got scared, it made it worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she had a panic attack that made it worse. She stated that of course her husband didn&#39;t tell her that until she was out of the ER, that it does go away. That made her feel better because she wasn&#39;t the only one that experienced that. States he didn&#39;t say anything about it, because he was worried about her,  he said it was a warm feeling in the chest and not being able to breathe but he didn&#39;t want to say anything because she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She mentioned that they weren&#39;t going to let her get the second dose, so she went to an allergy doctor and told them what happened and about her husband having the same reaction and because she was severely immunocompromised. Stated the hospital said they were not giving her the second dose unless an allergist says it is safe and sets a protocol and he had to write a letter to the hospital. Stated she was pre-medicated 24 hours before the vaccine with 50mg Benadryl, 50mg Benadryl the day of the shot and 50mg of Benadryl two days after the shot. Stated she will have full immunity on 14Apr2021. She added that she had a pulmonary doctor, brain cancer doctor, ENT doctor, stated they don&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine, but they are pretty sure she had a reaction but they can handle it with pre-medicating her. She received the second vaccine on 31Mar2021. She mentioned that she was happy to be able to get her second shot. She stated that at first they didn&#39;t want to give it to her because of her reaction but she kept calling. So she went to a hospital to saw an allergist and he had to sign off that it was safe to give her the second shot and under what circumstances. Stated she had the letter from the hospital that she was seen by them and she needed to be pre-medicated and it had to be given at a hospital that had the ability to intervene quickly and she needed to be watched for at least 30 minutes after the vaccine. She mentioned that to go through what she went though, and not be able to get would have been disappointing. Because of her immune system, it is important to get the shot and there was a way around the reaction which worked for her. She added that even having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, she was able to recover quickly. Stated with having asthma, COPD and a low immune system, she may not recover from Covid. It makes sense they evaluated it and came up with a solution and a pre medication protocol and when and how long and she was still able to get the shot because it is important. Answers to follow up questions indicated that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was given the shot and getting ready to get out of the chair and her husband was about to sit down for his shot. Stated she would say the time of the course of the reaction was within under 5 minutes of her injection. The patient required medical intervention with Epi-Pen, Benadryl, and Duo-Neb. The patient was not hospitalized because she was immunocompromised, it was better to watch herself at home and because she had an Epi Pen at home in case she has that sort of reaction returning over a 72 hour period. Stated they instructed her husband and told them if she felt any different to come back to ER. She was not admitted to the ICU. Organ involvement included: Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress. The event required initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure including Epi-Pen, Benadryl, DuoNeb. Patient have a history of previous allergies: Medication Allergies to Cephalosporins, Anesthesia medications: Propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, Percocet: Anaphylactic shock; Adhesive from nicotine patch, caused her arm to get red and swollen. She takes EpiPen as she had previous history of allergies and since she had multiple medication allergies and had a history of quickly going into anaphylaxis, stated her BP usually runs 90/45 and she was Bradycardic. She did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the events being reported. She did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. She has not received any other vaccines around the time of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient recovered from &#39;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#39;, Difficulty breathing, and &#39;warm feeling in the chest&#39; on 10Mar2021; while having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress were recovered on an unknown date; Vaccination site pain recovered on 13Mar2021 and Injection site bruising recovered on 18Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events except Vaccination site pain and Injection site bruising. Relatedness of drug to reactions/events: Reaction assessed for events &#34;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#34;, &#39;very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.&#39; and Injection site bruising: Method of assessment: Global Introspection: Drug result: Related.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the Company considered all serious and non-serious events as possibly associated to BNT162B2 injection, due to a plausible chronological sequence. Current patient conditions of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allergic diathesis may have been considered as favoring factors in development of reported events.

                                                I had mild anaphylaxis immediately after receiving the second dose. I did not make too much of it as I have a lot of allergies and carry an epi-pin that I have never had to use. Approximately an hour later I suspect I had a seizure at home.   I got my allergy shots yesterday 3/5/2021 and approximately an hour later I started having the same sort of &#34;spells&#34; for a lack of a better word that persisted through the night. The same exact feeling as the second vaccine injection without the anaphylaxis.

                                                I went back to the hospital and couple days later they told me that actually I have Deep vein thrombosis now in my legs; my Crohn&#39;s had caused really bad flare up/I have been in the hospital for 5 days now with the clot and Crohn&#39;s Flare; I also have superficial clot in that left leg that was the pain began on the edges/blood clot; the arm is much better now. You know that&#39;s not really sore; I just was too tired/extreme fatigue; really bad like pain; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 29Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included multiple sclerosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, ileostomy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, back surgery from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, Crohn&#39;s disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , blood clot in arm back from 2014 to an unknown date. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 on 08Mar2021 and experienced terrible diarrhea and neuralgia. Concomitant medication(s) included gabapentin (GABAPENTIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; diazepam (DIAZEPAM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported;  (ZOFRAN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; oxycodone (OXYCODONE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; lansoprazole (PREVACID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  After second dose on 29th  (29Mar2021) immediately he was really bad like pain and had shortness of breath. The patient stated that she had a back surgery and so she always felt bad, so she didn&#39;t think anything of it. But then she ended up into ER after the second dose and discovered that her Crohn&#39;s had caused really bad flare up. She mentioned her foot was looking strange but she was just too tired and left the ER. She then went back to the hospital and couple days later they told her that she actually had deep vein thrombosis now in her legs. She also had superficial clot in that left leg where the pain began on the edges. The patient reported that the vaccine was basically started the Crohn&#39;s flare up. The patient also stated that  &#34;the arm was much better now and not really sore&#34;.  The patient was hospitalized for DVT from unknown date and for Crohn&#39;s flare up for 5 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included endoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, ultrasound scan: all on  unknown date with unknown result. The patient was treated with Entyvio and on blood thinners now for a blood clot. The outcome of pain in extremity was recovering while others was unknown.

                                                After receiving the first dose on 4/1/21 Lot# ER8733, I had light spotting for 2 days.  Second dose given 04/23/21 and by 04/28/2021 I started bleeding again And by the second day I was soaking through pads and huge clots were coming out. This has never happened to me before.  After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results &#34;there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.&#34;   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain. That evening I passed a huge blood clot!  I&#39;m very grateful it was where it was and I could expel it.  But there&#39;s no doubt the second vaccine caused this issue that has never happened to me before. I still get my periods though irregular and very light. So this event was highly unusual and very painful

This is not normal.  I am seeking treatment from my OB dr.  2 weeks after the 2nd shot, I noticed my shoulder was not getting much better, it was achy still.  I started to have more shoulder pain. It has continued to get worse.  I now have been diagnosed with bursitis at the place where they inserted the needle for the 2nd shot. It continues to alter my way of life, as It is hard to get ready in the morning, and also hard to use my arm to pick things up and bring back to me. So extending my arm out in front of me and brining it back, to drink a cup of coffee gives me much pain.

It was uncontrollable. I tried to get up to walk it off. My body started shaking even more. I felt as though I were having a stroke. To stop my shaking, I placed one hand over the other but that didn&#39;t work. I fell back into bed. I called 911. The person said my reactions were normal side effects. They refused to send an ambulance because they said I sounded fine.  On May 9, 2021, I started cramping. I haven&#39;t had a period in over three years. On May 13, I started spotting. This morning (May 14), I woke up bleeding.

This Physician reported that a 54-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot No.unknown) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation on unknown date. Relevant medical history included Migraines, CAD, CKD III, morbid obesity, and allergy to sulfa. Relevant concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), topiramate (TOPAMAX), metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). No other vaccine was admitted in four weeks. The patient experienced DVT (deep vein thrombosis) and PE (pulmonary embolism) on 19May2021. Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic was visited. Emergency room/department or urgent care required. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days. Treatment therapy included anticoagulation. The outcome of events was resolving. The events were reported as serious (hospitalization and life-threatening). The patient did not have COVID tested post vaccination.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are considered unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine. No details on the administration date of vaccine were provided. The presence of morbid obesity and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are considered possible contributory factors for the events.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Pt was seen on 5/7/21,  Ophtho exam was negative.  MRI brain with MRV done showed a 10 mm bright lesion in the L corpus callosum with possible swelling as well as nonspecific white matter disease.  Pt was sent to ED, left prior to evaluation and returned the next day.  Seen by Neurologist in ED who recommended inpt evaluation.  Pt did not wish admission and left. Outpatient Neurologist evaluation was unable to be scheduled in a timely matter, so pt went to another ED on 5/13/21 and had evaluation including LP.  Working ddx included MS/ischemic stroke, SLE.  Started on ASA and statin. Pt has had outpatient Neurology and Rheumatology followups, planned for Neuro-Ophthlamologist consultation. R visual distortion was improving but still present at her 5/21/21 followup with me.

                                                After vaccination I still had output out of my Ilestomy bag (diarrhea). By Friday evening I began omitting with extreme nausea, incredible chills mixed with incredible sweats (where I saturated the bed and wanted to die). I was too weak to get out of bed and go to the ER in the City.  So I emailed my GI clinic to tell her what happened on Mon March 5th and was told to go to the ER for evaluation. I went to the ER on the 6th. I asked her if she could schedule a CTE to see if the Chron&#39;s was flaring / if I had a blockage. I continued to drink clear broths. Then I had sips of a smoothie and it triggered the nausea vomiting&#39;s, extreme pain of #25 but without chill/night sweats. I went to the ER on the 6th, they did a CT which showed I had an acute Chron&#39;s flair going up a foot of my Ilestomy bag and inflamed causing the bowel obstruction and was discharged to follow-up with my GI.  my leg continued to hurt and when they did the contrast test in the ER my leg turned dark and all veins were really dark.  On the 9th  I saw Dr and told him about the leg pain and what was going on and he told me to follow up with my GI. I tried to get a port in my chest because of the continued diarrhea. On the 13th in the morning I was called to go to the Hospital and went the same day, the nurse was preparing me for all the tests to be done the 14th. I asked the Nurse to look at my leg and she did and then left and got other clinicians and they confirmed I had multiple blood clots. They treated me with high dose Heparin for the blood clots. I couldn?t because I was in so much pain. I was in the hospital for 8 days and left the 20th of April.  I had falls in the hospital. I continue to have difficulty eating and losing a lot of weight. And now getting the Entivio infusions every 4 weeks.

                                                I began coughing the Wednesday after the 1st shot in April.  The cough continued. Just before 2nd shot I asked facility if I should get 2nd shot since I was coughing and they said yes. I had been concerned about family having MG and myself possibly too.  I got 2nd shot 5/7/21. I continued to feel ill. About 10 days ago diagnosed w/ pneumonia.  Took 1 round of antibiotics. Now on 2nd taking 2 antibiotics at the same time.

I had a fever of  102 .The following day the nausea that I started to experience  was horrific to the point where I felt like I wanted to vomit but  I just could not throw up, and  was also experiencing  fatigue and constant vaginal infections. I have had two periods and and nonstop bleeding after the second dose. I will be going to get an ultrasound next week in regard to what I experienced with the vaginal bleeding.

The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. Concomitant medications (reported as other medications within two weeks of vaccination) included estrogens conjugated (PREMARIN), micronized progesterone, colecalciferol (Vitamin D), folic acid (FOLATE), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced profuse watery vaginal bleeding 12 hours after the injection. The bleeding lasted approximately six hours. After the first injection and vaginal bleeding, a gynecology exam was completed for abnormalities. Previously diagnosed uterine fibroids present and some free fluid in the pelvis by ultrasound. Bleeding resolved by the end of post-vaccine day 1. After the second vaccine, heavy vaginal bleeding started 10 hours after a injection. It was reported that the adverse event result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment for the event involved removal of the IUD. Outcome of the event was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is reasonable possibility that the event vaginal hemorrhage is related to suspect drug BNT162B2 based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and the onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The day after the vaccination I had redness around my whole shoulder and arm. On the third day I developed swelling of my shoulder and neck with horrible pain when I breathe.   I went to urgent care and had an x-ray which was clear and they were treating me for myalgia with Motrin. I refused any narcotic pain medication or a Toradol shot.  The pain never stopped on the 19th I went to Work Force Safety and reported it and I was examined by the nurse practitioner who saw all the swelling and the pain that I was in. That nurse practitioner told me if it wasn?t better in a few days to go to the emergency room to be examined.  On January 23 , I developed swelling and pain went underneath my armpit it?s a burning pain that?s constant since the third day after my injection. My blood pressure was 153/104 and I was having nausea and not feeling well at all. On January 25 the pain and swelling were still there I went to work for a few hours and I went to the emergency room. They gave me lidocaine patch and Zofran for the nausea my blood pressure was 159/103 and I had an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot there was no blood clot but there was lymphadenopathy under my arm hurt and swelling and inflammation around the shoulder. The chest x-ray showed left pleural effusion / Pneumonia. My oxygen saturation was 93 and they wanted to admit me but I am a single mom with a new diabetic 14-year-old at home so they let me go home with a pulse oximeter and a prescription for doxycycline For 10 days.  They called me the next day from the emergency room to follow up with a pulmonologist and cardiologist. On January 28 I saw the pulmonologist who did an ultrasound in his office and saw the fluid on my left lung. He said that most likely because the technique of the injection was so high in my shoulder that they probably had a nerve and I did have the swelling in the lymphadenopathy and all the pain and it hurt when I breathe so I wasn?t breathing correctly and I was splitting my arm against me and that?s how I probably developed plural effusion and pneumonia. I am following up with him on February 4. I still have shortness of breath and my oxygen saturation is 93. I am also on two inhalers that the pulmonologist ordered.

                                                Day of shot developed pain in entire right side(chest area), also acid reflux and nausea. That went away about 12 hours after the vaccine. Ten days after I developed a slight pain in right lateral side that progresses to constant pain in 2 places on right side including under right clavicle. I had pain upon taking in a deep breath. Saw MD after 4 days of these SXS. Performed labs, Chest x-ray and EKG. All were essentially normal except elevated WBC count. Have 2 COVID test which were both normal. Md said possibly some sort of inflammation and suggested taking anti-inflammatories which did not help much at all with SXS. After a few more days the SXS changed to constant chest pain(pressure), SOB upon exertion and pain behind knee. F/U with MD again and it was decided to wait a few more days. Upon suggestion from friend asked MD to perform D-Dimer lab test. The result was 4,400. My normal value should have been 550. Sent to ER. CT of chest, EKG and more labs performed. CT revealed large bilateral pulmonary embolisms in pulmonary arteries. Started on blood thinners. Ultrasound of left leg revealed large DVT. Sent home after 2 days on blood thinners. SXS stopped after a few days.

A 55-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in arm left on 19Feb2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201), at the age of 55 years, as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed 3 years ago, ongoing gastrooesophageal reflux disease diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing hypertension diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing food allergy: allergic to eggs, shellfish, dairy/lactose intolerant, ongoing allergies to environmental: standard- hay fever, dust, mold, ongoing allergies to dogs and cats, contrast media reaction (IV contrast CT scan dye- respiratory distress, throat tightens), urticaria, pruritus. She had Covid on 18Dec2020 and &#34;Covid rash it attached her muscular system. She had muscular pain in the wrist and hip on the right side and mild double vision.&#34; The patient previously took vitamin k 2 and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Toradol and experienced urticaria, influenza vaccine and experienced rash at the injection site, at the age of 34 years (because she&#39;s allergic to eggs). The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 on 29Jan2021 Lot: EL3247; 9:30 AM; Right arm for covid-19 immunisation and she did not have any symptoms whatsoever with the first shot. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. Concomitant medications included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease; lisinopril taken for hypertension; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma; salbutamol sulfate (INHALERIN) taken for asthma; start and stop date were not reported for all.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis on 26Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, throat starting to close/throat started tightening on 19Feb2021 with outcome of recovered, severe rash- latus stranding, purple dots, and hives from face all the way down to toes on 19Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, double vision on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right eye is going cross eyed/left eye is dropping on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right wrist pain increased dramatically after the vaccine on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown for Hand swelling and recovered for Localised itching. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events: Benadryl, Zyrtec, Pepcid, New glasses for double vision, Prednisone 7 day ween. The patient underwent lab tests which included Hematology test on unknown date with unknown results; Immune markers on 11Mar2021 with unknown results. Clinical course: The patient received the vaccine on 19Feb2021at 10:00 AM and five minutes after, her throat started tightening and they put her in observation for another hour and then her throat felt fine and they let her go. Caller confirmed she was not referring to this occurrence as anaphylaxis.  The anaphylactic reaction occurred days later. She mentioned from 19Feb2021-26Feb2021, her symptoms were progressing and then on 26Feb2021, it was full blown out; the actual anaphylaxis was 26Feb2021. Between this, she had severe double vision, severe rash from face all the way down to toes, one eye going cross eyed (right eye), left eye is still drooping. On 20Feb2021, she started having double vision that started with the sunlight and fluorescent lights and the next day she couldn&#39;t see anything without double vision, and her eye started going cross eyed. She still cannot see normally now. She is under eye doctor care for that too. The patient was treated with Epi-Pen into leg and then into the Emergency Room. She received 50 mgs of Benadryl and 125 mg of Solu-Medrol IM injection, but still have to give Epi because her throat was still closing. Her airway was intact and no nebulizer treatment needed. The patient reported also that her hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch. The patient reported that her weight at that point was 204, the she had been on Prednisone for a week, and her weight has gone up to 210 now. After her throat closed on the 26Feb2021, caller reports she gained 7 pounds while on it for one week. Caller stated she was also put on prednisone when she got diagnosed with asthma, reactive airway. She confirmed her throat stop closing immediately after the Epi. The patient was also treated with 25 mgs of Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Pepcid a day. Outcome for throat closing was improved with medication. Outcome for rash was not improved and she is taking medicine to counteract it; itch went away when she took the Zyrtec. Regarding right wrist pain, it increased dramatically after the vaccine. Caller reports it felt like a spiral fracture down the ulna and it started to ache on 20Feb2021, by the next day it hurt a 5 out of 10. By 22Feb2021, she was wearing a splint, it was 8 out of 10, and she felt like she fractured it and it was swollen on the ulnar side. Regarding eye disorder, she is now under the care of an eye doctor for her severe double vision, eye crossing, and eye drooping. The blurred eyes give bad balance and that kind of stuff. The cross eyedness gives her poor peripheral vision and also her depth perception has now been compromised. They say the glasses will fix it. As of 22Feb2021, a new pair of special lenses with prisms were ordered for her. The patient was not hospitalized.

                                                Anaphylaxis, confirmed by ER; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 55-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EN6200, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 at 12:15 PM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported as the hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took codeine and hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN), from which she had known allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID post vaccination. On 19Feb2021 at 12:15 PM, the patient experienced anaphylaxis, confirmed by emergency room (ER). The adverse event (AE) resulted in a doctor or other HCP office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of anaphylaxis, confirmed by ER, which included epinephrine, steroids, and antihistamines. The patient recovered from the event on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

A 55-year-old adult female received the first dose of BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot EN6202 and expiry information not provided) via unspecified route in the left arm on 03Mar2021 between 17:10 and 17:30 (at 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Frozen shoulder (2020-2020), and severe migraines (especially in the past ten years). The patient further stated that she has always had migraines. She said sometimes when her migraines escalate, her blood pressure goes up, and her left side tingles. She said several times in the past, she thought her migraine symptoms may have been a stroke. She said she her doctor is checking her for any kind of things like rheumatoid arthritis, mast cells, constant (chronic) fatigue, and fibromyalgia. She said right before the COVID-19 Virus pandemic she had passed out unexpectedly. She said she doesn&#39;t know what caused her to pass out. She said she needs another neurological test done. She said she had a neurological test that maybe showed that veins were dying in her brain, but she wasn&#39;t sure. She said her doctor had been doing heart tests too, but because of the pandemic, it was taking longer to have the tests done. The patient also mentioned that her last blood work was probably in/around Nov2020. There were no concomitant medications or past drug history reported. The patient denied receiving any other vaccination within the four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient also denied receiving any other vaccination on the same date as the vaccination. The patient reported that on 04Mar2021, approximately seventeen hours after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she had what she thought was a kind of severe reaction. She said she had an inside numbness and tingling all over her body. She said the left side of her body, especially, had a very strong numbness and tingling, like a stroke. She said the numbness was in her left hand, and outside left shoulder. She said the left half of her face was numb. She said at the time she felt weird. She said she was speaking to her friend on a video call and did not want her friend to think she was a cry baby. She said then her friend told her there was something happening with her face. She said the right side of her face had dropped. She said her right eye and the right side of her mouth were drooping. She said she told her friend she thought she had an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine.  She said it took about three hours for her symptoms to pass. She said afterward she was so tired, had pain, and a headache. She said it was strange for her to have a headache because she was used to migraines. She said she still had a headache today (08Mar2021). She said she had a heaviness with her headache. She said if she had a migraine, she would not be able to do anything, but with the headache she had, she was able to go about her everyday things. She said her stomach was bothering her too, but she was not worried about how her stomach felt. The events did not require any visits to a physician&#39;s office nor the emergency room. Treatment for the events included drinking a lot of water and moving around. The outcome of the events, inside numbness and tingling all over her body, very strong numbness and tingling, like a stroke¸ numbness was in her left hand, and outside left shoulder, half of her face was numb, right side of her face had dropped, and tongue looked swollen, and allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine was recovered on 04Mar2021 after about three hours duration. The outcome of the events so tired, and pain was recovered on an unspecified date in Mar2021. The outcome of the events, headache, and heaviness with her headache was not recovered.

                                                Received last shot of Pfizer on 3/21/21 Sunday morning. Zero side effects initially--barely sore arm, no malaise--which is what had happened with first Pfizer shot. On  3/26/21 Friday night around 10PM started itching on knees, then legs, then torso, then everywhere. Bad hives--never had hives before. Couldn&#39;t wear clothes. Woke up in the morning  and had scratched myself in my sleep on my arms until I was bruised and spots on my body were bloody. Got some Allegra and took it Saturday morning around 11AM. Got things under control within an hour so I could be functional. But still had welts and was itchy all over. Took Allegra 180mg morning and night through Monday night. Things got better. The following Friday night, 3/26/21, same thing. Body started to itch around 9PM. Welts. Not quite as bad. Took an Allegra 180mg immediately and then morning and night through Sunday night. Not nearly as severe.

My early Monday morning I was in so much pain that I went to the ER. I was diagnosed with acute DVT in my entire left leg from the Iliac vein in my abdomen down to the ankle. The entire leg was occluded.

Then on Wednesday morning, March 31st (two weeks after receiving the first dose), she was found in bed by my mother, unable to walk or talk, her face was drooping, she was very sweaty, and had defecated on herself. My mother called the ambulance. She was transported to Hospital where it was determined she had suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke. She was immediately transported by ambulance to another Hospital. She spent one day in ICU and then was put on palliative care. She died around 12/N on Friday, April 2nd, two days after the stroke.

                                                On April 9th, I developed a headache at 9pm while watching tv. About 15 minutes later I noticed my vision was changing so I called my daughter to come stay with me and took tylenol fast release capsules. I went to bed and woke up the next morning with the same headache so I asked my daughter to take me to urgent care. Upon arrival they did a Covid test. I told them about my previous stroke in July 2020 and that I had a PFO closure done in October and have been on Plavix (clopidogrel) since then so I wasn&#39;t worried about stroke. The dr sent me to the ER immediately and they performed an MRI scan and told me I had suffered a new stroke due to blood clot.

On further history, she was feeling some chest tightness in mid-April, so may have started in between the two doses.  Not sure if it&#39;s related - pt also has MGUS which may be the cause of her hypercoagulable state, but felt I should do my due diligence and report it given the temporal relation to her vaccines.

It was because of that it&#39;s a progressive disease get involved with many part of the body that is all so causes seizure. Concomitant medications included clobazam; lamotrigine; escitalopram; amitriptyline; calcium folinate (LEUCOVORINE); lorazepam; mesalazine; butalbital, caffeine, paracetamol (FIORICET); vitamin b2 [riboflavin] (VITAMIN B2 [RIBOFLAVIN]); ubidecarenone (COQ10 [UBIDECARENONE]); l-carnitine [levocarnitine]; vitamin b complex (B COMPLEX [VITAMIN B COMPLEX]); vitamin a [retinol]; vitamin c [ascorbic acid], all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.

It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. Outcome of events Grand mal seizure and Pulmonary disorder was unknown.   Information on batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported seizures along with the consequent aspirations which lead to death  and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded.

The patient reports that she had a stroke several years ago but for some reason was told to not take aspirin and was not started on Plavix.  Irregardless, the patient came in with a very significant left-sided neurologic deficit.  She states that she could not speak, she had left facial droop, left arm weakness, and left leg weakness.  She initially had an NIH stroke scale in the emergency room of 11.  Initial CT of the head showed nothing acute.  Consultation with neurology was obtained and the patient was sent for a CTA of the head and neck.  No large vessel occlusion was identified and shortly after this the patient&#39;s NIH stroke scale reduced to 2 and shortly after this the neurologic deficit completely resolved and stroke scale return to 0.  At that point, the patient was diagnosed with a TIA and admitted to the hospital for observation.  This morning she states she feels fine.  She has no neurologic deficit whatsoever.  She denies any sensory or strength deficits this morning at all.  The patient sugars have been a little bit high, but otherwise she had an uneventful evening

                                                A few days after the vaccine I began to have a cough about mid morning which changed to SOB.  Covid test on 12/27 which was neg. I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

                                                56 year old female presents with complaint of tingling and numbness that she noticed to her lower left jaw.  It occurred yesterday around 3 PM after she received her Covid vaccination.  She states that then started to move up to her left cheek but has now gone back down just to the lower left jaw.  It is in a specific region of that area.  She states also that she is having a fever today and generalized body aches that are moderate in nature.  She also notes some urinary frequency without dysuria or hematuria.  Patient took Tylenol this morning around 6 AM.  She initially tried to swallow the pill and felt like she was going to choke on it and spit the pill up.  She then sat down for a few minutes and was then able to take the pill.  She denies any actual stridor or wheezing.  No focal weakness or numbness of one arm or leg.  No change in speech. Differential diagnoses include but are not limited to: CVA, TIA, anxiety reaction, paresthesia, metabolic process, bleed, vaccine reaction.  56-year-old female with paresthesia to the left chin.  Otherwise normal neurologic examination.  The TPA window given symptoms started yesterday.  I will get a head CT but I do not feel the patient needs an MRI.  Given the fact the patient does have autoimmune disorder, blood cultures and lactic acid obtained.  I suspect that her fever is in response to her Covid vaccine yesterday.  Covid test negative.  Urinalysis no evidence of UTI.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Head CT negative.  On reevaluation after Motrin patient feels much improved.  At this time I think she is stable for discharge to home.  I do not think this is Bell&#39;s I am finding no facial weakness on my examination.  Follow-up and return precautions discussed patient understood

A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 56-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The husband commented that both of them got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 07Mar2021 and some minutes later, the patient started having a reaction that she had to be taken into the ER with an ambulance: her throat started to close, she could not breath and her pressure raised to 230. Until today, she has not fully recovered, and they have been getting in and out of the ER, in fact they just arrived home from there. Physicians only prescribed antiallergy medications and the patient was still having the same problem and her throat itches on an unspecified date. The physicians they have consulted have contradictive opinions about how she should do: one recommended her not to get the second dose while another recommended her to get started again on the series. The husband wants to know what they can do about this. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Feeling flu-ish by Friday evening?Achy, headache, tired all weekend; my symptoms from my lung problems also seemed to increase. Although it gradual improved a little day by day, I felt like I had the flu for over a week. It is probably important to note that the vaccine shot was approximately 4 1/2 months after I had Covid.

A 56-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 24Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER2613) as a single dose for to prevent COVID (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included having blood clot from 2019 to Mar2021 which the patient stated a couple of weeks ago (Mar2021), she had an ultrascan in her leg and the blood clot was not there, but she is on medication. The patient has recovered completely from blood clot (not ongoing). Concomitant medication included warfarin (WARFARIN) to prevent from having blood clot ongoing since Jun2019. The patient previously took gabapentin for pain but had throat started closing, allergic reaction, coughing and was intubated until she was released from hospital; and albuterol [salbutamol] for dyspnoea but had nebulizer to open up her airways and prevent closing and did not work (drug ineffective). The reporter mentioned that the patient ended up in the ICU because of the COVID vaccine. As soon as the vaccine was administered within seconds, the patient experienced a reaction and was given an epi pen, another epi pen even an epinephrine drip and was sedated and intubated. The reporter mentioned that they gave the patient the first shot of epi pen and it did not work, and she was given a second one and a third one plus steroids. By the time the ambulance people arrived, they hooked the patient up to an IV and gave her additional epinephrine and administered another epinephrine. The ambulance guy told her; she does not need to keep up with them because they needed to go to the hospital ASAP because the patient is not getting better but getting worse. Once the patient got to hospital, she was intubated because her throat was closing. The reporter stated that the patient has allergies to begin with and this was worse than the first time she had to be intubated. The epi pens did not work, the patient was intubated and then had to be sedated. The patient was on Propofol in order to sedate her and later on in the evening was given Fentanyl to relax her then the epinephrine drip was removed at 6 pm on 24Mar2021. The epinephrine drip was started in the emergency room and the patient could not be moved to the intensive care unit until she was somewhat stable. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit and was there overnight and by the time next morning she was able to be extubated where they removed the tube from her around 9:30 to 10:00 25Mar2021. Of course, the patient was taken off Propofol, but she went through a lot and her legs are sore, throat is sore, and is coughing on 25Mar2021 because of the side effects from being intubated and that she went through a lot. The intensive care unit doctor said that the patient can no longer have the vaccine and she would only be 70% protected till whenever they are not sure how long the vaccine will last. The adverse events almost took the patient&#39;s life which made the reporter angry at that. The reporter is not sure what the contents in the vaccine that it in the other drugs and vaccines since there is something that is contained in all of them and the patient was not allowed to have any whether it is the Pfizer or Moderna and it is even up for discussion for even the flu shot because of the reaction and there does not want to be any chances and that everything should be proceeded with caution. The reporter wanted to know what is in the COVID 19 vaccine to see about what could have caused the allergic anaphylactic reaction. The reporter stated and the fact that the epi pen did not work, she was taken aback. The reporter added that the doctor had a hard time intubating because of her throat but they were able to intubate from the second time. The reporter stated that it is taking a while but her wife is recovering and feeling it is taking a while taking a little bit longer. The reporter also stated that they kept the patient in the intensive care unit overnight and after the tube was removed in the morning, by the late afternoon she was moved to a different floor to continue to be observed and the intensive care doctor said 2 days out her wife would be safe to go. The patient stood up but it was hard for her to walk on 25Mar2021 because it could have been from the epi pen, but she is not sure. The patient stated the side effect came out of the allergic reaction and it was on Thursday 25Mar2021. Patient stated the main trouble is her breathing, she is out of breath still and really sore throat on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that the leg sore is still ongoing and is about the same. It was mentioned that the throat sore was still ongoing but some days are worse and some days are better. The patient stated that when she has a problem trying to swallow a tablet and digest it and it gets stuck on Mar2021. It was stated that the cough was not going away. The cough comes and goes away. She will cough for five minutes constantly and then it disappears then she will fall asleep and wake up coughing. It&#39;s as if she is choking (Mar2021). When she is talking, she coughs more. With regards to the allergic anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated she is experiencing the aftereffects of the allergic reaction and being intubated like being out of breath. The patient stated that will come in time and that&#39;s what happens when she gets intubated. Her breathing was heavy and comes back fully with rest on Mar2021. This has taken a lot out of her. She was feeling tired which was still ongoing it is about the same but comes and goes on 25Mar2021. The patient is experiencing lingering side effects and the patient does not feel as if she has recovered completely. It was also mentioned that the patient was intubated on 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021. It was reported that treatment of the patient included Epi Pen, Epinephrine Autoinjector USP 0.3 mg (Epinephrine injection manufacturer was Mylan) which the patient was given at least three injections (two in the right leg and 1 on the left) then received another in the ambulance (unknown site). Patient received an Epinephrine drip and it was like 0.1 mg all the way up until 6 pm (only on 24Mar2021). The epinephrine drip was started when patient was intubated at the hospital. It was given for patient&#39;s allergic reaction through IV. The patient&#39;s lungs were filling up with fluid so her airway was restricting her from breathing and to prevent damage of the lungs that is when the intubation came in. The patient also received Prednisone which the reporter does not recall when this medication was started it may have been after the epinephrine drip was removed but she is not sure if they started the prednisone after or if it was the same evening which the reporter kind of thinks it was. The reporter stated that the patient took Propofol 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 which was given through the patient&#39;s IV and was given to help her airways being intubated, they sedate their patients. The patient also received fentanyl which must have been added either right before Epinephrine drip was removed or after but reporter does not recall. Patient was given Fentanyl 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 through her IV. Patient received this medication to relax because sometimes it is like some patients tend to want to sit up and kind of hear you, hear what people are saying and to relax patient sometimes because they can get scared and not exactly sure what is going on. The events anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary oedema, throat constriction and breathing difficult. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lung was checked from a CT scan was unknown results on 12Jun2019, D dimer test was elevated on an unspecified date, ultrascan in her leg (ultrasound scan) blood clot was not there on Mar2021 and weight was probably weighs 180 or her weight may be a little less like 175 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events anaphylactic reaction and throat constriction were recovering, as for the events leg pain, throat sore, cough and tiredness were not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 56-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 18:45 (Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure (BP), sleeping, cholesterol. Patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included calcium and unspecified Multi Vitamin. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took erythromycin (EMYCIN) and experienced allergies, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (VICODIN) and experienced allergies. The patient experienced her back side was raw and bleeding on 12Apr2021, sour belches on 12Apr2021 08:00, vomited on 12Apr2021 08:00, having dark liquid diarrhea pouring out of her rectum on 12Apr2021 08:00, could not sleep on 12Apr2021, her entire stomach area was swollen and in extreme pain just to touch on 12Apr2021, her stomach and back side were very pain full on 13Apr2021, it was not liquid coming out of her rectum but a grey/taupe very soft stool on 14Apr2021, gassy on 14Apr2021. No treatment received. No covid tested post vaccination. Clinical course: She received the first Pfizer vaccine on 08Apr2021 evening, she thought it was easy, no problems. 12Apr2021 morning driving to work she started having sour belches, she got to work and ran to the bathroom, she vomited #6 times while having dark liquid diarrhea pouring out of her rectum, it finally stopped, 3 hours later it started again, she vomited 4 more times with more dark liquid pouring out of her rectum. Her boss sent me home. At home she was running back and forth to the bathroom the rest of the day with dark liquid diarrhea and another vomiting session throwing up #5 more times for a total of #15 Times. She could not sleep as her entire stomach area was swollen and in extreme pain just to touch and her back side was raw and bleeding. 13Apr2021 morning she vomited 3 times along with still having dark liquid diarrhea pouring out of her rectum and her stomach and back side were very pain full. 14Apr2021 she could not go to work again, she had no vomiting but continued with the on going dark liquid until 3:00 PM, she went to the bathroom and it was not liquid coming out of her rectum but a grey/taupe very soft stool. Her stomach area continued to hurt, she was still gassy. She only ate a banana, toast and Gatorade per the Dr. This was such a horrible experience. After the first shot she was praising the Pfizer Shot, now she would not. She did no really want the second shot after this experience. She was a new widow struggling, she had no one to help her, she had no phone as she had thrown up on her new phone and ruined it. This was such a terrible experience. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I did go to the emergency room two weeks after I had my shot because the doctor my primary could not give me any answers and I questioned him about the second shot and he had no answers. My surgery has been canceled. My back surgeon mentioned something about my lymph nodes that they were swollen which is what he thought was water build up in my left side of my neck during an MRI he then did a CAT scan checking to see what that was and he mentioned my lymph nodes. I originally went for MRI because I had had several falls into surgeries in my neck and he was checking to see if anything collapsed and that&#39;s when he found through the CAT scan that my lymph node was enlarged. I still carry the cough heart palpitations and fatigue and I have put off the second shot but nobody can give me answers so I did research and saw about the MRSA the diabetes and as well as the swollen lymph nodes

A 56-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 18Mar2021 10:30 (at age of 56 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included: Asthma, immune problems, upper respiratory stuff, all ongoing; Her Diagnosed allergies include iodine fish, Propofol, and preservatives, sleep apnea, had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough (Jan2021) from that. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took iodine, propofol and had allergies. Patient took first dose on 18Mar for reason that patient has lost all allergies that cannot be detected by blood work. After first short she was told to wait an extra 15 mins not vitals taken she can leave a felt like a specimen unpaid but paying with life. Patient started coughing while everyone watched her so she said she better take Benadryl cause she doesn&#39;t wanna die. Patient left had off balance couldn&#39;t see straight. She was the one that had all side effects from vaccine as well as COVID signs. She had research medicine/food that cause her to have anaphylaxis. Patient found same ingredients in vaccine but food and drug said it ok. Patient was an experiment. She need to no from your board it is ok for me to take 2nd vaccine. Patient should be getting paid. Her doctor making it seem it up to her she gotta go out and get and epi pen she cant afford. In running out of gloves and mask. The patient experienced Anaphylaxis, has been trapping food since in her throat, headache with numbness, Cough, blurred vision and nausea from headache, all on 18Mar2021. Caller has been coordinating with the CDC by email. Since day one she had a bad reaction to the COVID vaccine. This has been going on a month now. The CDC advised her not to get the second shot. She has went back and forth with the doctor. She had anaphylaxis from the vaccine. Her throat closed. She had irritation in her throat. She has been trapping food since in her throat. This has been since the anaphylactic reaction. She has to chew her food as fine as possible. She tries not to eat that much. This is still the same. It hasn&#39;t improved or worsened. She has also had a headache with numbness that is pretty much 24 hours a day. This started right after. She really felt it the next day. She tried to take Tylenol for four days, three times a day, and nothing happened. It was not going away. Her doctor also put her on a migraine medication, but it didn&#39;t work either. The headache has worsened over time. No medication is helping, and the doctors are confused. The migraine medicine is not helping. Her pressure is going up and down. She is wondering if she needs an emergency echo to see what is going on. She is still having bad effects. No doctor knows what to do. She has been to a lung specialist. Her cough just keeps getting worse. The cough started to get worse after the vaccine. She had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough from that, but the vaccine made it worse. It is a ruff cough. She is on cough suppressant medication. Caller did not have a prescribing doctor. She got it at the hospital. She figured that was the safest, and since she is a patient there they emailed her because she was eligible to get it. She is mostly calling because the doctors don&#39;t know how to help. She is about to pass out from this headache. She is even losing vision from the headache. She feels like she is going to have a heart attack before her time. They are trying to figure out why her head is hurting. They do not think it is a migraine. Her headache is a 9/11 or a 10/12. She feels like after the vaccine she has been chemically off balance. She wants to get her thyroid checked too. Mostly because her food is getting trapped in her throat. Her throat is irritated and hoarse. The headache has given her blurred vision, and a felling like she is going to throw up. She feels off balance from the blurred vision. Caller had difficulty seeing information on Tylenol and Nurtec. She asked her husband to help. They cannot read the lot on the Tylenol. She has been to so many specialists to try to find answers, and no one has a clue. She saw on Pfizer&#39;s paperwork that she needs to reach out to a immunologist. Her allergist had no clue. From the world trade centers falling she has ongoing issues from that. She has sleep apnea, allergies, asthma, etc.  She spent 30 minutes being monitored at the hospital. She had started coughing. Her husband said she needed water. She always carries Benadryl with her. Finally she felt like she needed to take her Benadryl. It saved her. She knows the Benadryl probably won&#39;t work forever, but she cannot afford an epi Pen. Time of Onset (24 hours clock): right after vaccine (18Mar2021). All events require a visit to Physician Office. She didn&#39;t have to go the ER. She was lucky with the Benadryl. She takes Benadryl with her everywhere even to restaurants. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Treatment received for coughing, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache. The outcome of the event has been trapping food since in her throat, had irritation in her throat, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

A 56-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 22Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included disability, obese, covid-19 when she was sick with COVID last year, she has never been that sick. she thinks she made it through because she owns a nebulizer and can say her lungs have never felt like they were full of fluid. If anything, they felt heavy. It was heavy in her back and chest. She also had a fever. She guesses she would be considered obese. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine last week and she has experienced several side effects and is very anxious and nervous. She experienced redness and itchiness at the injection site, pinching sensation on inner thigh that she thinks may be blood clot or a muscle but not really sure, fever of 100.3F from 24Apr2021, burning sensation in her ear, tiredness, headache, heaviness on her back and chest on the left side, no appetite, nauseous, diarrhea, had a feeling of heat on her neck, face, and ears, throbbing sensation to the left side of her belly button from 26Apr2021 and she felt dizzy from 22Apr2021. The patient stated there was a bad connection and she was having difficulty hearing. The patient was a little nervous. Maybe this was a psychosomatic issue and she was thinking of things too much. She was sick for 5 weeks. She was never in the hospital or intubated. The site where she had the injection was large, red, hot, and itchy. It was from 22Apr2021 (Thursday) for the next maybe 3 days. Now the color is diminishing, the color is going down more like to pink and smaller and it not itching anymore. Once in a while she got a pinching sensation on her inner thigh ever since she had the injection. In the last couple days, she has been feeling a that a little more. She wanted to make sure it was not a symptom of a blood clot. She doesn&#39;t feel short of breath. She was nervous talking the call handler so that is why she is talking fast. She doesn&#39;t want to feel so sick like she did last year when she had it in March or April. She wanted to know that it&#39;s not a symptom of a blood clot. It was a throbbing pinching pain that goes and doesn&#39;t come back for a little bit, but it might come back a little bit later. It happened when she woke up. She has no swelling in her legs or thighs or anything else. She says she would not be talking this fast, but her heart was beating fast and she was nervous. She tended to be an anxious and nervous person. The patient never had blood clot issues. She wanted to make sure with everything that she has heard about Pfizer she hasn&#39;t heard of anyone having blood clot issues. She had to read to calm herself down a bit. It is a sharp pain with throbbing that comes and goes. She didn&#39;t read where it could be a blot clot, she just wanted to know. She is horrible at running to the hospital when she feels something because she gets so nervous and she thinks knowing is better because she&#39;s a realist. It takes her a minute to go to the hospital to figure it out. If she continues to feel like this she and her daughter will go to the emergency room. It is 5 blocks away. It is a small little hospital and they will be able to ease her mind. It could be her nerves getting to her too. Her fever got up to 100.3 and that was only on Saturday, 48 hours after the vaccine. Once she took Tylenol it was gone and didn&#39;t return again. She took her temperature; it was a beeping one. She always says she would take like 2 out of 3, and every time she took it went up. She felt a weird sensation of burning in her ears, the same as when she first had Covid, feeling like a fever. It brought her back to a bad place and it freaked her out. She is on disability and has people go to the store for her. She did that for 3 to 4 months. She is not agoraphobic, but she hadn&#39;t gone out until she got the vaccine. It took her all day to get back home because she loves the outdoors. It is kind of sad, and she knows she is not the only one who experienced that. She was able to actually stay at home, and when she went out, she wanted to stay. She still has her second dose to take, not everyone in has this and she doesn&#39;t want to feel that sick again. Eventually she will perish away one day, from God knows what but a slow death of not being able to breathe she cannot picture for herself or anybody else. She tries not to watch the news, it was depressing, because it is all over the news, she tries to stay in the loop. She was tired and had a headache. She took Tylenol and slept for an hour or hour and half. When she woke up she felt heaviness on her back and chest on the left side, and as she moved around more it was on her back and less on her chest. It was the same as she felt when she had Covid. She didn&#39;t have any aches or pains. The other thing was she had no appetite for the next 3 days. Every time she woke up, she felt extremely nauseous but had nothing to vomit. For the next 3 days or 72 hours, she had diarrhea. If she ate anything, she was in the bathroom. On 24Apr2021 (Saturday) after 48 hours she started to feel the heat in her neck and face and ears like right on her ears. She was talking to her daughter and her daughter said these are normal. Where she got the injection was itchy and a little more red. She told herself not to scratch it in her sleep, she is one of those people if something itches, she scratches. What she would do is rub her arm up and down on the site. It was almost the size of an 8 ounce tomato sauce can or maybe the size of a baseball. Then the third day it got redder. In her sleep she was rubbing her arm because it got itchy. Today the swelling went down, the color is like a light pink, and the size is also minimized. The fever lasted that night. She took her temperature again the next day and it was 97.9. That is usually what it is when she wakes up. She is not just tired; she is exhausted and feels like she has to go to sleep. Her daughter came with her granddaughter who is a baby, and she didn&#39;t know how to tell them. She was happy to see them but so exhausted. She worries about the sharp pain in her thigh. The other thing is she started getting pain in the middle of her thigh, her inner thigh. A sharp pain with like a throbbing is almost like a band-aid is too tight. If she rubbed her hand across her thigh, she could feel crushing and throbbing. She can feel it from touching the area. She had this before like when she is stretching. It started maybe 3 months ago and went away but then after she took the injection and heard about thing, she worried about a blood clot with Johnson &amp; Johnson, not that she would know because she has never had a blood clot. It could be psychosomatic and all working in her head. It started the last 2 days when she woke up, she felt fine and as she was lying in bed, she started feeling a sharp throbbing pain that eventually goes away. She has no swelling of her legs or thighs, and her daughter said it looks fine. She is semi-terrified of hearing bad news. It takes her longer to go to the hospital. If she starts feeling worse, she will be there in no time. She does not want to wait until it is worse, but she does not want to spook herself into going. She suffers from anxiety. She definitely had the fever not like she was just tired it was like she was exhausted. She got up early and would take a little nap because she was doing a bunch of stuff. That hasn&#39;t happened, but that&#39;s her. It will be 2300 when she goes to sleep. She was doing a bunch of stuff and felt like she just needed to take a nap. Maybe it is part of that too, but usually she doesn&#39;t feel tired like this. After her daughter left, she read something on her phone and passed out. When she woke up, she saw she actually dropped her phone. Her thigh is now not a pinch but more a little bit of a muscle pain. Now it is not like the inner thigh, it is more behind the thigh now, but not below the knee, right behind the thigh, closest to the knee but not on the knee. It is the same thing as if the middle had gone behind her thigh a bit. The little pillow on her chair is not helping anything either. It feels like it maybe muscular, its deep feeling. It feels like it could be muscle, if she rubs it, she can feel it. When asked has it improved persisted or worsened, caller states it is there, but it is dull. She can say there is pain, but it is a little duller just because it is more in the muscle. It is hard to explain, it was not the same throbbing pain but there is a dull pain, it goes around the chunkier part of her thigh, like the inner thigh. When she rubs it there is pain but a dull pain. When she rubs it, it feels better but she can still feel the site where it hurts. When she rubs it, it is still located right in the lower middle going toward her knee but not at the knee, maybe 3 to 4 inches away from the fold of her knee, almost at the center of her thigh almost. Almost like a dull muscle ache, there is a bit of throbbing with it. She will go to the doctor if something weird happens and will call back when they have an idea of what happened to her. This will sound crazy. The next thing she felt was a light throbbing where her belly button is but more to the left side, but not at the belly button. It was like at her stomach, not right at the belly button but right on the same line as her belly button but more at her waist. It was a small throbbing started today about an hour ago. She is hoping it is gas. Her fever went away pretty fast. She was on the phone and took her temperature to tell what it was. The woman said to take some Tylenol. It went from 99.9 to 100 to 100.3. She thought oh no. That was the highest she saw. Then eventually it started going down to 99.4, and then by morning it was back to normal. She only took Tylenol the one time. She is thinking maybe it is from being nervous and causing her body to heat up. She doesn&#39;t know she is just thinking. She thinks the fever went away the same day within an hour to 2 hours. She also wasn&#39;t drinking enough water. When asked if her fever has recovered completely or with last effects, caller states that is fine now, her temperature today was 99.4 without the fan on, she says she thinks that was pretty normal. When she first wakes up it is 97.9 usually. There was also a 98.4. The redness and itching at the injection site started 3 hours after the injection. She took her 2 sons with her. She took it and then her son took it. They said to wait 15 minutes. As soon as she stepped out, she looked up and felt so dizzy. It looks like when in summer and it seems to be boiling hot, that is how it got for her. Things got blurry. It was not like she was going to black out, but she had to close her eyes because the room was going to spin. She knocked back on the door and took a seat, so she sat down because she was not feeling right. When she gets nervous, she chews gum as a coping mechanism. Her son got some gum for her. She felt better but kind of nervous waiting for 15 minutes to go by, what if she felt dizzy again. She let 20 minutes go by and she got up and was fine. She wanted to be out of there and in the cool air outside. That is the first reaction that she had. She is one of those people that feel so nervous she is sure that happens that they feel like, oh they are so nervous, and they read so much, and it is in our faces everyday no matter what. Maybe it had nothing to do with the injection, maybe more that she was so nervous, but it was a weird sensation after. She knows when people first started getting the COVID vaccine, people were just like falling to the ground, she was like that would be terrible. She went with high expectations and was also nervous. Her heart was beating, and she could hear her own heartbeat. She still feels tired and like she can go take a nap now. She asks if that is normal. She would rather talk to Medical Information now. She is over this statistics part of it. She doesn&#39;t feel a release, she is just giving her information and she doesn&#39;t feel any better. Outcome of the event throbbing sensation to the left side of her belly button/It was like at her stomach was not recovered; of the event dizzy was recovered; of the events the injection was large, red, hot, and itchy/ the swelling went down, tiredness was recovering; of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After the first vaccine, I had the expected headache, fatigue, slightly sore arm, slight nausea, and headache which lasted a couple of days. I then developed what felt like menstrual cramping and acidic stomach pain, but I hadn&#39;t had a menstrual cycle in seven months, and only two in the past two years.  On the 11th day after my vaccination, I had very light bleeding for a day. I didn&#39;t connect it to my being vaccinated at all. In the past, I always experienced acidic stomach pain right before my period. I was concerned about cancer so made an OB appointment right away. I didn&#39;t see her until two weeks after my second vaccine. I was given the second dose three weeks later on April 21, 2021, and the morning after I had the same side effects as with the first dose--headache, fatigue, slightly sore arm, slight nausea, and headache. Two days later on April 23rd, I began having vaginal bleeding again, only three weeks after the first vaccine. The bleeding was very heavy and lasted for ten days--longer than any vaginal bleeding I&#39;d ever had and much heavier in flow.

                                                The day after the shot I experienced rib pain and shortness of breath which seemed to get better over the next few days.  On 5/29/21  I initially had pain in right side rib area and shortness of breath. Pain migrated to chest and became more severe. Shortness of breath also persisted.  I was unable to lie flat and tried to sleep sitting up in a chair, however the pain got so bad that I had to go to the emergency room where I was diagnosed with pericarditis and Afib.  I was put on IV and given Torodol pain meds. I was in hospital from around 4am Sunday May 30th until being discharged June 2. I have had follow-up visits with my primary care doctor and cardiologist and am currently on Metropolol. Dosage is 25mg two times daily and one baby aspirin once a day.  I was not in Afib on leaving the hospital but was back in Afib 6/17 at my cardiologist visit.

                                                I had the vaccine around 2:30. Around 6:15pm my heart started racing even if I was walking. I became dizzy, short of breath and just exhausted, and it got worse. After 24 hours I couldn&#39;t function and had to go to bed. Even a week later I was still fatigued and had shortness a breath. After 7 it started to linger away. I went for a walk a week later and was short of breath and went to dinner and was exhausted. I was hit by car and when I got a ct I had fluid in my heart which they didn&#39;t know whether it was from the vaccine or the accident.

It happened between 6-11 pm on 4/12 (the day after receiving the vaccine at 6 pm on 4/11). It did not impact my breathing, but I had itchy welts and hives over most of my trunk and arms and upper legs. I took a Claritin and it helped relieve the symptoms.   After the 1st dose on 3/20/2021 I also experienced mild rash like symptoms and hives for several weeks following the vaccine.

As the pain persisted the pain radiated to the left arm/shoulder.  We sought help at our local emergency department where she was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation.  A battery of tests were ordered including a troponin which was noted to be:  1.48.  She was transported via ambulance to the hospital to be admitted and undergo left heart cardiac catheterization with the presumptive diagnosis of NSTEMI.

                                                On the fourth day after the injection, I experienced blurry vision that was relatively mild over the course of maybe an hour. The next day, the same thing. The following day, March 25 (vaccine was 3/19) I experienced transitory vision field impairment in the left eye which came in from the left periphery. This came and went over the course of about 1-1/2 hour, including throughout the visit to my doctor.  Prior to this, both my 21 year old daughter (who was vaccinated the same time as I was), experienced sudden migraines at the same time.   On Saturday 3/27 I began to experience a twitch/pulse which is still happening intermittently in my left cheek.   I received the second dose of the vaccine April 9th. The twitching continues. Additionally, I had sharp pain across the length of the sole of my foot that was brief. It recurred three times.   I&#39;ve had a thorough workout which does not indicate the source of the problem.   I&#39;ve begun taking baby aspirin, but experience minor bleeding if I take it more than once weekly.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EW0150; expiry: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Mar2021 01:30 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was a warehouse. The vaccine was not administered at a military facility. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and no following prior vaccinations. Medical history included covid-19 in Nov2020. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 on 31Mar2021 and 12 hours later (on 01Apr2021), sore arm, fever, chills and headache. Got a swollen lymph node in armpit, same arm as injection left side, today tip of left ring finger turned white and numb. She thinks it was Reynauds phenomenon. The patient called and told nurse in her doctor&#39;s office and they said if it was painful, it could be a pain clot. It was painful at first, that lymph node started 24 hours later with a sharp pain, and then she just assumed it could be a lymph node. Swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and it was very sore. The nurse told the patient to call Pfizer. The patient was fine until the tip of her finger happened. The patient said If it was painful it could be a blood clot, would need an x ray and asked if did the shot cause this. The complete ring finger left hand, the patient looked it up and it said it could happen to her feet and she looked, and her feet were modeled red, blue it was bizarre. Never happened before. The patient was not happy about getting the vaccine, she already had covid in November of last year (2020). The patient wouldn&#39;t have called if it wasn&#39;t for her finger. Not just her feet, her hands got like this too. The patient didn&#39;t want to get the second shot. The patient asked if there was any information or mandate on timing information for the second dose, should she needed to postpone it. The patient asked if what was the efficacy after first dose as she felt like she was immune because she had the virus and now the vaccine. She was very hesitant to get the Covid 19 vaccine. She thinks her body created Covid 19 antibodies. A couple days ago she was very sick. The swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and could be a blood clot as far as she knows (in 2021). Even putting on deodorant she can tell it&#39;s there, it was very sore and there&#39;s a lump. Today (on 01Apr2021), she noticed the tip of her finger got white it was numb. She looked it up online and she thinks it was Reynaud&#39;s phenomenon. She has a picture if Pfizer needed it. The finger was on the same arm that she received her vaccine in. It was the ring finger on left hand. Once it started happening her finger felt funny and felt numb. She put her finger under warm water. She reported that the white color was maybe a third of the way down towards her knuckle. She was asking if this was normal or has this been reported. She had called her doctor today and spoke with the nurse who told her to call the CDC and report her symptoms. She needed her glasses trying to give her primary care doctor&#39;s phone number. The patient wanted to add that she has something like gout in her foot and on that side too, the left foot, it was pulsing and throbbing all night. She&#39;s had this pain in her left foot, she thinks its gout because it was all the symptoms of gout and she had it for a while, it hurts off and on but that night it was hurting and throbbing. She has not been diagnosed with gout in that left foot. She still has a headache but today she felt good except for her finger turning white and going numb. The lymph node in her armpit hurts. Her doctor&#39;s nurse told her if its painful to the touch it could be a blood clot so she was nervous about that. The tip of her finger was completely white and the rest of her hands were blue and red and white and yellow. She reported that her finger was back to normal now. She didn&#39;t want to get too inoculated since she also had the Covid 19 virus. The events did not require visit to emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events was unknown for thrombosis, Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon, erythema, cyanosis, illness, visual impairment, and gout while for the remaining events was recovering.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 20Jan2021 13:30 (at the age of 57 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, at a workplace clinic. Medical history included hypertension (HTN) and depression, both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no history of COVID prior vaccination. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT); and benazepril hydrochloride, hydrochlorothiazide (BENAZEPRIL/HCTZ) both taken for an unspecified indication. On 22Jan2021 the patient experienced arm pain and severe general back pain. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced severe dizziness and vomiting. She went to urgent care and symptoms were treated. The patient was advised to have follow-up with the patient&#39;s professional care provider; she had MRI and CT angio of head on an unknown date with unknown results. The patient was diagnosed with cryptogenic posterior cerebellar CVA on 23Jan2021. Due to the events, the patient was recommended to have full diagnostic working including cardiac and neuro workup as treatment. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization for three days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT angio of head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): both with unknown results on an unknown date, and Nasal Swab: negative on 12Apr2021. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that vaccine BNT162B2 contributed to the reported events; these are likely intercurrent medical conditions in this patient with underlying hypertension. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 57-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 17Apr2021 at 14:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162), at the age of 57 year, as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included anaphylactic reaction to spider bites, pruritus, ongoing hypersensitivity, ongoing allergy to arthropod sting. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took Lortab [hydrocodone bitartrate;paracetamol] and experienced drug hypersensitivity, singulair and experienced drug hypersensitivity. Concomitant medication included neocell super collagen, 6g collagen six per day as supplement.  On 17Apr2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic shock, reported as medically significant. The patient reported &#34;I started to pass out. She had tingle in her lip/her tongue was tingling. Her BP was 150 something over 90 she thinks she heard 159 before they gave her; her throat was starting to close up, she had trouble swallowing.  She went to the hospital straight from the clinic where she received the vaccine.  The patient reported the following: she went for shot at 14:30 and they didn&#39;t take her in until like 14:45. Patient stated after the shot, she sat down and knew she had to wait for at least 30 minutes because 10 years ago she had a couple events of anaphylactic shock due to spider bites. So patient stated she knew she should wait. Patient stated she started reading her book and had trouble swallowing at 5 minutes later, but she decided to keep reading book. Patient stated that 10 minutes she started to feel a tingle in her lip and then she started paying attention. Patient stated she then went over to the staff and found someone who was not busy and explained to them what was happening. Patient stated that staff member walked her over to the nurses station and at that time her tongue was tingling and this is not even 15 minutes later. The patient stated they gave her 10 ml of Benadryl and at about 15:05 at about 15:20 they had to give her the epinephrine because her throat was starting to close up and they called 911. The patient stated unfortunately the epi didn&#39;t; it may have slowed it down but she started to pass out. She don&#39;t know what her oxygen level was at that point. The patient recalled that her BP was 150 something over 90, she thinks she heard 159 before they gave her the Benadryl or at the same time.  The patient stated once the EMT&#39;s showed up they gave her an IV and gave her steroids and that stopped her throat from closing and they gave her oxygen and that made her feel so much better. The patient stated it&#39;s like reliving the story here and her throat is starting to close up, patient clarified she is just choking up thinking about it and denied that her throat is actually closing up during call. The patient stated they did a lot of testing after did not show any signs of clotting which was good. Patient stated she did have trouble breathing, and they checked heart and her heart was fine. Patient states her throat, that is the part she needs to talk with her doctor about. Her throat didn&#39;t start to completely relax. Patient stated it was still tight on Sunday and Monday and that was a little concerning for her, but as far as lab work, no. Patient stated she was not admitted to the hospital, she spent 5 hours in the emergency room (ER) for observation and got sent home with an epi pen which she is not going to get and steroids which she finished yesterday. Patient stated she is not going to get the EpiPen because she does not foresee any need for it due to the amount of money it costs. Patient stated it costs $232 dollars and that is just too much, not to mention the amount of money she will have to give to hospital for the bill due to this event. Patient stated she is pretty clear that she won&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t get the next shot. The clinical outcome of Anaphylactic shock  was recovered on 20Apr2021.  The clinical outcome of her throat is starting to close up was not recovered. The clinical outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 57 year old woman works as a cleaner with PMHx morbid obesity, HTN (on amlodipine, metoprolol, triamterene-HCTZ), CKD3 (baseline Cr 1.1-1.2) who presented to the ED on 5/28 with worsening shortness of breath, cough with yellow sputum, fatigue, and weakness, found to be COVID-19 positive. She was subsequently admitted to the MICU for acute hypoxic respiratory failure.    At baseline, she is independent in all ADLs and works as a cleaner at an office building. She got the first dose of the pfizer COVID vaccine series 5/10, scheduled for second dose 6/2. She lives with her husband and nephew in a house with additional family members who live downstairs. She says she only really goes to work and always wears a mask while there. Her daughter (lives downstairs) helps with grocery shopping. No recent travel or sick contacts that she is aware of.   She was in her usual state of health until 5/22 when she said she started to feel poorly. She had increasing shortness of breath over the next few days with worsening fatigue and cough to the extent that she was considering calling off from work. She continued to feel poorly and decided it was time to go to the ED on Friday, 5/28.    Today, she says she is feeling better and is less short of breath. She still has coughing that is occasionally productive for clear sputum. No fevers, chills, lightheadedness/dizziness, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Her appetite is improved, and she is eating and drinking better today.   Patient is a 57 year old female with PMHx obesity, HTN, CKD3 who presented to the ED with shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, found to have COVID-19. In the ED, she was hypoxic requiring increasing amounts of oxygen, ultimately with 40% FiO2 via Ventimask and HFNC when admitted to the MICU. CT chest with GGO/patchy consolidation in posterior lung areas and bases as is typically seen with COVID-19 infection.   She has been started on remdesivir and dexamethasone and is now requiring HFNC for oxygen supplementation. Likely her single dose of vaccine has helped to lessen her disease severity. She meets criteria for addition of tocilizumab.    Recommendations: - Continue dexamethasone and remdesivir - Can add tocilizumab - Health care maintenance: Screened for HIV 2009, HCV 2018, HBV 2018. Last TDAP 2015.    I saw and examined the patient. I strongly agree with the resident/fellow&#39;s findings and plan of care.  Patient with risk factors for severe Covid including obesity underlying kidney disease and hypertension presents with fever fatigue malaise and infiltrates on chest CT a little over 2 weeks after initial mRNA vaccination Denies any anosmia Agree with current treatment plan including dexamethasone and 5 days of remdesivir duction and maintenance and okay for tocilizumab as she is less than 24 hours into the ICU Other health maintenance up-to-date HIV negative remote hepatitis negative I will ask lab for cycle threshold out of curiosity as she has been vaccinated which likely has mitigated severe disease   Explained to patient in detail and questions answered.

Arrived here, trop is 0.21, CTA chest neg for PE, labs otherwise ok, DR consulted with another Dr, thought it was ok to go home on low dose metop, but patient has continued chest discomfort and was afraid to go home, was decided to admit for serial trop. Dr will see in am.   No cardiac risk factors; nonsmoker, brother has svt and had successful ablation, no fam hx CAD. Drinks up to 3 glasses wine per night. Office worker. EKG now nsr without ischemic changes.  Hospital Course by Problem:  #Paroxsymal SVT: No recurrence of sxs following adenosine administered by EMTs. Associated mild troponin elevation as below to 0.41 likely due to persistent tachycardia. EKG NSR w/o ischemic changes. Admitted and started on metop 25 mg XL nightly without recurrence. Cardiology consulted. Echo showed no WMAs or valvular issues, with preserved LVEF (although E/A flow reversal suggestive of possible diastolic dysfunction). Pt stable to discharge 3/16 with outpatient cardiology follow-up.  - discharge on metop XL 25 mg nightly - referred to follow up w/ Dr (info added to AVS) w/ TOC cardiology. Since she is a patient, she may elect to seek a referral through her PCP.   #Elevated troponin: Trop peak 0.4. No ischemic changes on EKG. Suspect due to prolonged tachycardia. Also possible mild pericarditis as below. No WMAs seen on echo. Outpatient stress test recommended by cardiology. - outpatient follow up with Dr for stress test  #Small pericardial effusion, ?mild pericarditis: Small effusion seen on echo. Given associated mild chest discomfort, query possible pericarditis. Unclear if this triggered SVT or vice versa. Hemodynamically stable w/ no evidence of tamponade physiology on echo and only mild symptoms. - given small size and mild sxs, no anti-inflammatories rx&#39;d - pt given return precautions and advised of signs/symptoms that should prompt her to reach out to PCP or cardiologist

                                                Patient presented on 4/8 to  Hospital for COVID pneumonia, transferred to another hospital on 4/21/2021.  At Hospital, she was treated with convalescent plasma, course of remdesivir, and dexamethasone. She was requiring HFNC during day and BiPap overnight. She began to improve with decreasing O2 requirements on 4/15. On 4/17, she was found to have L-sided deficits and increasing hypoxia, which required emergent intubation. Dexamethasone was increased to 6 mg BID and she was started on Levaquin and Flagyl for aspiration penumonia, consolidated to ertapenem on 4/20. She had been on Eliquis prior to this, but this was discontinued after she developed the stroke sx on 4/17, switched to Lovenox. Initial head CT negative, but repeat head CT on 4/19 showed large R sided MCA territory infarct. She was placed on ASA. 4/21 head CT showed edema and mild midline shift. Neurology was consulted, who recommended hyperventilation, 3% saline, and elevating HOB &gt; 30 degrees. She was then transferred to St. Mary&#39;s ICU on 4/21. At  Hospital, patient was treated for aspiration pneumonia (cefepime 2g Q8H on 4/22-4/25, meropenem 2g once on 4/22, tobramycin 400mg daily on 4/22-4/23) and COVID.  However, she had significant difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation. Given her prolonged course and her right MCA CVA with significant deficits it was predicted that she would need long term ventilatory support therefore PEG and tracheostomy were placed on 4/29. She remained relatively stable until 5/2 AM when she suddenly developed massive subcutaneous emphysema and hypoxia. It was suspected that her tracheostomy had become dislodged. Patient was re-intubated orally with difficulty however there was no color change with EtCO2 and patient was in cardiac arrest. CPR was briefly performed however code status was clarified and patient was DNR. Trauma surgeon and intensivist were in agreement that any other interventions would be futile. Time of death was 0645 on 5/2/21.

The Doctors did not know what was wrong and ended up being diagnosed with a septic kidney and the Dr. said that normally that occurs from a UTI and I have never had a UTI; however, now, I have three and I just came from the Dr.&#39;s office today with another checkup.

EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; palpitations; tachycardia/heart rate 141; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP). This HCP reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of two reports.  This 58-year-old female HCP (patient) reported for herself that received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176) on 10Jan2021 at 0.3 mL single by intramuscular injection left arm for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension and diabetes type 2, both diagnosed about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that a few days after receiving the 2nd dose (on 14Jan2021), she went into atrial fibrillation and had been having palpitations ever since. She had a cardiology appointment in a few weeks and they started her on apixaban (ELIQUIS). Lab data on 14Jan2021 included EKG: normal sinus and Kardiamobile (a medical grade ECG): it showed tachycardia and at least one other time showed atrial fibrillation, heart rate 141. The outcome of palpitations was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown. Reporter seriousness for atrial fibrillation and palpitations was medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of  atrial fibrillation cannot be fully excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.  ,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021111803 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

A 58-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 31May2021), intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 29Jan2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation (has a pre existing atrial fibrillation), patient also has under active thyroid from unspecified date. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included magnesium taken daily from an unspecified date and for unknown indication, an unspecified medication for atrial fibrillation and an unspecified low dose medicine for cholesterol. The patient previously received the second dose of unspecified shingles vaccine on an unspecified date for immunization and felt sore arm maybe a little under the weather. On 22Feb2021, the night before the second dose of vaccine, patient reported she was in atrial fibrillation, she was tired but she didn&#39;t sleep the night before second dose because she was in atrial fibrillation and was exhausted. She took extra of her atrial fibrillation medications. She does not think she took Tylenol after first one. Does not think arm was sore after the first one. The patient was vaccinated at a mass vaccination site. The events did not require emergency room or physician&#39;s office visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                bilateral pulmonary emboli; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician. A 58-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: unknown, Expiration Date: unknown) via intramuscular in the left arm on 05Mar2021 10:15 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included psoriatic arthritis and asthma. Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: unknown, Expiration Date: unknown) on 12Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. On 09Mar2021 17:00 (5.00 PM), the patient experienced bilateral pulmonary emboli, which resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The patient received blood thinners as treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the event bilateral pulmonary emboli mostly represented intercurrent condition in this patient with advanced age, unrelated to Bnt162b2. Relevant medical history and concurrent treatments are missing for a medically meaningful assessment.

Chills and fever came next, at around noon. Sudden onset of Shortness of Breath came on around 1:30 pm, with O2 sat dropping to 79-80% at home. Went to ER by 2:00 pm. Fever spiked to over 102. O2 sat fluctuated between 80s and low 90s %. Admitted with new onset of mild CHF and SOB.  Remained in hospital for 2 days/nights until O2 stayed in the 90s. Fever and other symptoms remained, and I have continued taking Tylenol every 4-6hours.

It felt circulatory, not muscular or skeletal. Swelling behind knee. I went to ER for ultrasound and they found a blood clot. Cat scan revealed pulmonary embolism. The nurses at the hospital confirmed that this was happening frequently. They said it wasn?t rare. My PA at the clinic told me it was 1 in 5000 like me. Why doesn?t the hospital report?  I?m on bed rest for 10 days, compression stockings and Eliquis to thin my blood. I have halted all HRT, but have been  told by my dr that it?s clearly not related since i e been on them for over 6 years and never had a blood clots.

Currently is receiving supportive care by mechanical ventilation with ARDS. Question is why such a severe response to rhinovirus infection and whether vaccine induced an inflammatory response causing ARDS / diffuse lung injury.

It wasn&#39;t heavy enough to require a pad or tampon, and occurred around the same time as I was relieving myself.  I had read that others had experienced  post-menopausal vaginal bleeding as a side effect after receiving the vaccine, so I decided I should report this instance.   Other than being constantly exhausted - which I&#39;m not sure is a side effect of having had Covid-19, a side effect of receiving the vaccine, or just because I&#39;m older - I haven&#39;t had any adverse side effects.

Her friend that took her told me that she was having a reaction to it when he took her home that day. He said she had the chills really bad that he had to turn the heat on in the car and give her a coat. He said later she was sweating. She didn&#39;t make any calls on her phone after 5:20 pm. Her sister found her dead inside her home the next day.

                                                Rash appeared after first shot on January 18 in my groin area and then again after second shot on February 8, 2021.  Rash disappeared by March 15. It reappeared as hives on April 7. New hives would appear each morning with severe itching. Over time they would go through 4 states - bright pink and itch, splotchy red, red, and then bruise. I was diagnosed with urticarial vasculitis on April 23 by a dermatologist and now I have seen a rheumatologist that confirms it.  I am on steroids to suppress the hives that can cause damage to my blood vessels and organs.  I am on Plaquenil for at least a year and Dapsone.

                                                This was a 58 year old female who received her 1st dose Pfizer on 4/6/21 (Lot# EW0175) and 2nd dose Pfizer on 4/27/21 (Lot# EW0151).  Of note, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident on 4/12/21 with a diagnosis of concussion and cervical/thoracic strain/sprain (see history under patient information).  On 4/29/21, the patient&#39;s sister contacted the patient&#39;s primary care clinic with the following documented concern:  &#34;Pt&#39;s sister calling to report that two days ago pt got 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine and has been sick. This morning they found her passed out against the her bedroom door. Pt reports that she can&#39;t remember much other than going to the bathroom.  Pt&#39;s sister states that patient totaled her car a week ago, and that it was determined she had a concussion.  &#34;She hasn&#39;t been herself since the wreck and I am very concerned.&#34; This caller recommenced the Ed or UC but caller denied stating that either needs to see her today. This writer is reaching out to nurse to see if they can advise from here.&#34; A RN assessed the patient virtually with the following documentation:  &#34;RN note:  Call transferred from patient&#39;s sister.  Pt noted to be found on her floor this morning. Pt unsure if she hit her head.  Spoke to patient.  She reports body aches, and feeling weak.  Pt is slow to answer questions, and had a lot of difficulty hearing me (sister did not have any difficulty hearing me).  Pt is noted to have more rapid breathing, and some slight wheezing.  Speech is clear when she is speaking.  Sister gave patient water to drink.  She drank out of bottle and was able to hold on her own (though had difficulty with this at first).  Sister noted some water dripping down face, but was able to swallow okay.  Sister also noted that patient&#39;s lips seem to be pursed. Plan: Given recent concussion, and patients change in behavior per sister (pt more irritable, speaking more slowly, moving slowly, breathing faster, and wheezing), recommended patient be taken to the ED today--recommended ambulance since it took 2 men to help patient back to bed this morning.  Sister states patient is not agreeable to going to ED at this time.  Advised to try to encourage her to drink more fluids, and continue to monitor her sxs, and if any worsening, to call for ambulance transport.  Sister agreeable to plan, and will discuss with sister, and recommend ED visit today.&#34; On 4/30/21, the patient&#39;s sister contacted the clinic to inform them that the patient was found dead that morning.  The medical examiner is completing the further investigation. If additional information is needed from the primary care physician for this patient.

A 58-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8729), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 09Apr2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neuropathy on the bottom of her feet, cancer and cannot sleep from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included metoprolol succinate at 275 mg, daily (125mg of metoprolol succinate in the morning and 150mg of metoprolol succinate in the evening) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 19Mar2021 at 10:00AM (at the age of 58-years-old) in left upper arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 09Apr2021. She was sick all day the day after (10Apr2021) but was fine by Sunday. On Monday, 12Apr2021, she mentioned that she underwent radiation therapy, then noticed that her injection site was swollen, red, and warm to the touch on 13Apr2021. On 10Aapr2021, her heart rate also went up because she is scheduled for chemo, radiation and has an a-flutter. She mentioned that the COVID shot made it go up. She is asking how long these side effects should last and for what to do. She mentioned that the nurse at her doctor&#39;s office told her to contact Pfizer on what to do. She is a high-risk cancer patient. She received her second dose of the COVID vaccine on 09Apr2021. The next day, she experienced tiredness, a headache, chills, and body aches. She also had a fever of 99.4, 99.7, and 100.8. She was feeling unwell. Then she got a fast heartbeat. She has been having that problem. She has A-Fib and A-Flutter. She has been doctoring every week about her A-Fib and A-Flutter. Then she was fine. On Monday, she had radiation. After radiation, on Tuesday, 13Apr2021, her arm at the injection site was swollen, red and hurting. Then her heartbeat started back beating fast. She has had a headache on and off. She had a headache on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. She does not look at her weight. She has gained so much weight since cancer. She retains liquids because of her cancer. She is probably about 230 pounds. She has been tired because of her cancer. But this was different, this was extreme tiredness. Began on Saturday, 10Apr2021 whenever she woke up. With her cancer, she cannot sleep. After the second dose of the covid vaccine, she was so tired, she actually rested well. She was feeling yucky, with chills, a headache and a fever. She is grateful that she was able to get some sleep. It was completely resolved on Sunday morning, 11Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Bad headache began on Saturday, 10Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Sleeping relieved her headache. She took some Tylenol even though she is not supposed to take Tylenol because of her chemotherapy. Tylenol could affect her liver because of the chemotherapy. She took the Tylenol for her fever and to help her headache. Her headache is on and off, but it is a lot better since her first headache. Her headache was the worst on the first day. She thought her symptoms were clear until her arm at the injection site was swollen, red and hurting. It was also hot to touch. Chills, body aches and fever of 99.4, 99.7, and 100.8, feeling unwell began on Saturday, 10Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Completely resolved on Sunday morning, 11Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Her heart started racing on Saturday, 10Apr2021. Then it resolved on Sunday, 11Apr2021. Then her fast heartbeat came back whenever her arm at the injection site started to get swollen, red and hurting. She thinks that her fast heartbeat could be anxiety too. She has anxiety. She takes heart medications that are supposed to slow her heart down. The medications are not working. Chemotherapy makes her heart worse. She called her doctor about her heart beating fast. She has not heard back from her doctor yet. Usually her doctor will up her mediations. Now tomorrow, she will be filling her body with poison. Chemotherapy makes her heart worse. Chemotherapy name, lot number, NDC and expiration date: Not provided. The Pfizer covid vaccine made her heart worse. She is supposed to get chemotherapy tomorrow. She does not know what will happen tomorrow. She thinks that her doctor is going to have to up her medications. She has been seeing her heart doctor every week. Because of radiation, she has not seen her as much. She is going to see her heart doctor on Tuesday. Her heart doctor has been doctoring her for forever, and she sees her every week since she was diagnosed with cancer. She prefers for Pfizer to contact her heart doctor if there are any follow up questions. She had to have surgery, and after that she went into A-Flutter. Her heart doctor has been on it since. Clarified that her heart medications normally do work. She thinks that the COVID vaccine counteracted her heart medications. Normally her heart rate is under 100. After the COVID vaccine, at 7:00PM, her pulse was 104. On Saturday, at 4:30PM, her heart rate was 111. At 8:00PM, it was 109. On Sunday, it got better. At 7:30AM, it was 96. At 6:00PM, it was 90. On Tuesday, whenever the injection site turned red, was hurting and swollen, her heart rate was 104. Currently her heart rate is 94. She has A-Fib and A-Flutter. She has been doctoring that every week about that. After that she was fine. On Monday, 11Apr2021, she had radiation. After radiation, on Tuesday, 13Apr2021, her arm at the injection site was swollen, red, hurting and tender to touch. Her heart started beating fast again. The redness is the whole width of her arm. She is asking how long she can expect this redness to last. She does not know if radiation triggered this. It happened right after radiation that she started on Monday. Her daughter told her that this is normal, and a lot of people have this happen. The day before the second dose of the COVID vaccine, she had internal radiation. That was her third radiation treatment. She told her oncology doctor about the COVID vaccine and her doctor talked to her about it. Her doctor told her to go on and get the COVID vaccine, and that people like her needed the vaccine. She did not have radiation with first dose of the COVID vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bad headache and fever of 99.4, 99.7, and 100.8. The outcome of the events sickness, fever, chills, feeling abnormal, body aches and feeling unwell was recovered on 11Apr2021, headache was recovering, while of the rest was unknown.

Pain appeared approximately 1 day after receiving second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. Second dose received on 4/29/2021. Additionally, the patient experienced fever, chills, and fatigue, which had resolved by her presentation to the clinic on 5/3/2021. Pt noted the pain was partially positional, but was constant and found little relief with tylenol purchased over the counter. On physical exam, swelling of the lower extremity was noted with decreased hip ROM. Pain was ellicted on palpation of the calf. No erythema was noted. Pt was sent for Venous Duplex Ultrasound of both legs which was positive for deep vein thrombosis in the right leg.

Since my second dose (April 15) , I am now experiencing menstrual-like vaginal bleeding. Because I am post-menopausal (last period was in December 2017), this is concerning to be experiencing a menstrual like side effects. I continue to have minor vaginal bleeding for the last 7 days. I don&#39;t believe this is related to my tamoxifen prescription, as I have been on tamoxifen since April 2018 with no such side effects.

A 58-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 14Mar2021 10:00 as 2nd dose ,single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN BAYER). The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Feb2021 for COVID-19 Immunization. The patient received the Second dose of Pfizer on 14Mar2021, states, &#34;On 17Apr2021, Saturday, nose bleed started, and my blood pressure went up. I Called ambulance took blood pressure and it was 210/107. I didn&#39;t go to hospital, nose bleed had stopped while they were there, I stayed in ambulance until blood pressure came down. Sunday I went to ER  (emergency room) because my nose started bleeding again, it stopped Sunday, but they checked the nose, nothing was there. I stayed in the hotel, Monday morning I blood again, Tuesday I bled even more starting at 7am and it didn&#39;t stop. Went to the hospital to ER (emergency room), they packed my nose to stop it from  bleeding, clots were coming out, clots coming both ways, they checked blood, not anemic, everything okay with blood.  on 23rd they removed the pack from nose, ENT told me no vessels were broken, he said I was fine. That is when I received a phone call about someone else having this problem. A week later a class mate said her sister had the same reaction after getting the Pfizer vaccine.&#34; She was calling about the Covid 19 vaccine. She received her second vaccine on 14Mar2021 and had no problems during that time. On 17Apr2021 she called an ambulance because she had a nosebleed. Her blood pressure was also high at that time around 210/107mmHg. Her nosebleed stopped with emergency management technicians and her blood pressure came back down. She did not go to the emergency room at this time. On 18Apr2021 at around 3:00AM, she had another nosebleed and she did go to the emergency department at about 10:00AM. She has never had a nosebleed before. When she was examined in the emergency room on 18Apr2021, she had no blood in her nose that the doctor could see. On 19Apr2021 around 7:00AM she had another nosebleed but the nosebleed stopped and she did not go back to the emergency room. On 20Apr2021, her nose started bleeding around 5:00AM and it didn t stop so she went back to the emergency room around 7:00AM and the doctor in the emergency room packed her left nostril and the blood was coming out of the right nostril and out of her mouth. She was bleeding for a few more minutes and then the bleeding stopped. Her blood pressure was fine. Her bloodwork was checked and everything was fine. She wasn t anemic or anything like that. She didn t have an bad effects from the nosebleeds. The emergency room told her to follow up with her primary care doctor on Thursday, 22Apr2021, but her primary care doctor no longer takes her insurance. She did go see an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor on Friday, 23Apr2021. The Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor removed the nasal packing and examined the inside of her nose and told her that he could not see any broken vessels or any cause as to why she would be having nosebleeds. The patient&#39;s apartment is being renovated and she thought she might be having a reaction to the hotel she s staying in. She moved out of her apartment on 12Apr2021 and her nosebleeds started 17Apr2021. She has missed work because of her nosebleeds and she started back to work this week. When probing for her Covid 19 vaccine information she reports she does not have the vaccine record card with her. She received the second Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021. NDC/Lot/Expiry not known. First Covid 19 vaccine date is in the suspect product field. She does not have the NDC/Lot/Expiry for the first date either. She reports she had a regular physical with her doctor in Nov2020. She received a tetanus vaccine at that visit. She reported she sometimes takes 2-3 regular Bayer Aspirin for minor pain. She took the Bayer Aspirin on Saturday, 17Apr2021, because she was going somewhere and she knew she would be sitting for a while at that place. She would like to report she experienced no discomfort, or aches or pains or headaches with her Covid 19 vaccine. There is no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The outcome of the events was unknown.

Patient had metastatic ovarian cancer on chemotherapy who was admitted to the intensive care unit with severe sepsis with septic shock and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation mechanical ventilation. She was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but did not have an obvious source of infection.  She remained on mechanical ventilation, with profound metabolic acidosis.  She required high doses of norepinephrine and vasopressin drips, but on arterial blood gas had a pH of 6.98.  The patient had a cardiopulmonary arrest in the intensive care unit.  1 round of ACLS protocol was performed, with return of spontaneous circulation.  After discussion with the patient&#39;s mother by phone, she opted for DNR status, comfort care, and to allow for natural death.  The patient was kept on mechanical ventilation, and she passed away.

A 58-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 17Mar2021 (at the age of 58-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included stroke in 2012 (first stroke was from a heart attack), heart attack in 2012, stroke in 2017, stroke in Dec2020, high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing, diabetes from 2013 and ongoing, glaucoma from 2009 and ongoing, ongoing at risk for heart failure, ongoing tumor in her stomach (23 years, benign and hasn&#39;t been surgically removed due to other issues and not harming her), ulcers (3 ulcers in the past and none currently), broken ankle in 2014, preeclampsia attack in 1990, baby being strangled during birth in 1994, broke her pelvis during birth in 1996, and complicated birth in 1996 (which she was in a coma for). The patient had no family history. Concomitant medications included labetalol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for heart condition from Dec2020 and ongoing; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; furosemide (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) from an unspecified date and ongoing; atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for stroke from an unspecified date and ongoing; ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, calcium, chromium, copper, folic acid, iodine, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, zinc (CENTRUM WOMEN 50&#43;) from an unspecified date and ongoing, and unspecified eye drops for glaucoma from an unspecified date and ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced stroke like symptoms/minor stroke, high/extremely high blood pressure, blood sugar numbers were very high in the 700s, face on the left side felt paralyzed like she couldn&#39;t feel if something was in her mouth, trouble seeing on the side of her eye/can only see straight on the left side, and blurry vision on 08Apr2021, which all required hospitalization from Apr2021 to Apr2021 for 4 days. The patient also experienced losing her balance, numbness in her arm, soreness/sharp pain on her arm, dizzy spells, and fatigue on 08Apr2021 and fall and splintered hand on 30Apr2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: It was reported that the patient had stroke like symptoms, which were reported to be not a result of the vaccine as the patient had a lot of health issues. The patient had the vaccine and was completely fine and then right around the time she was supposed to get her second dose she was showing signs that could have been a minor stroke. She just had high blood pressure and her blood sugar numbers were very high in the 700s on 08Apr2021. It affected her face. It was not a full on stroke, she got to the hospital in time. The patient had strokes before. They thought it was better to stabilize her blood pressure and blood sugar before getting the next shot. She was in the hospital for 4 days. They gave it time to stabilize and come to a normal number. When it did and they went back to the pharmacy, they said they did not feel comfortable administering the second shot after 42 days. Now it was pushing more than 42 days. The reporter stated she would not necessarily call it a stroke. Her mother had symptoms leading up to a stroke but not a full on stroke. She had numbness of her arm and blurry vision, but not a full on stroke. She was in the hospital the week of 07Apr2021. She was supposed to have the second shot on 14Apr2021. She was discharged from the hospital the week of 12Apr2021, either that Monday or Tuesday. She had trouble seeing on the side of her eye. She can only see straight on the left side. Her face on the left side felt paralyzed, like she couldn&#39;t feel if something was in her mouth. She has been losing her balance. Her blood pressure was through the roof on 08Apr2021, as well as her blood sugar. She did a video chat with the doctor the night before going to the emergency room (ER). They monitored her symptoms, and they started within the first 72 hours before going to the hospital. She had a blind spot in her left eye. The other one she can see just not as great as before. Before this instance she did not have a blind spot, and now she does. The patient walked with a cane now. If she is outside, she is held with someone and cannot just walk along because she does not see well by herself. She had to sit at a certain angle to see clearly. Her vision is not well. The numbness in her arm comes and goes. Sometimes it is a sharp pain and sometimes it is numb. It was definitely worse when she was at the hospital. The numbness and sharpness level goes hand in hand with when her blood pressure is too high and fluctuates with her blood sugar and blood pressure. With her face feeling paralyzed, her left eye socket is closed a little bit. She has more mobility than when it happened. She has been working on it with physical therapy trying to get it back. Her balance was off when she wasn&#39;t seeing well and was unassisted. She would get dizzy spells and fall. Now she is more aware of when she will feel dizzy and will let them know. The cane helps her balance. The dizzy spells came at the same time as the other symptoms. They fluctuate. They have stabilized over time. When it first happened, they were a lot more frequent. Now they almost never happen. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, all in 2021, which included bloodwork: unknown results, computerised tomogram (CAT) scan: unknown results, and x-ray: unknown results (on her hand when she broke it in the past 2 weeks). The clinical outcome of stroke like symptoms/minor stroke, soreness/sharp pain on her arm, fatigue, fall, and splintered hand was unknown; high/extremely high blood pressure, blood sugar numbers were very high in the 700s, face on the left side felt paralyzed like she couldn&#39;t feel if something was in her mouth, losing her balance, numbness in her arm, and dizzy spells was recovering; and trouble seeing on the side of her eye/can only see straight on the left side and blurry vision was not recovered.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.

The patient previously took historical vaccine of first dose of bnt162b2 for covid-19 immunisation and experienced trouble Breathing; she took generic for crestor and experienced massive weight gain so she has stopped that now. She was taking CoQ10 to keep the muscle pain down from the statin but it couldn&#39;t get rid of it. Concomitant medications included cortisol hydrocortisone [CORTISOL [HYDROCORTISONE]] taken as 12.5 mg when wakes up, 5 mg at 1:00pm, 5 mg at 5:30 pm. Also as needed, when needed, levothyroxine(LEVOTHYROXINE) taken as 88 ug, 1x/day  (88 mcg once a day), metformin taken as 500 mg, 2x/day (twice a day), rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken as 5 mg, diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken as needed, dhea(DHEA) taken as 5 mg, fish oil, magnesium (MAGNESIUM) taken as 800 mg, daily (800 mg a day), ascorbic acid (VIT C) taken as 100 mg, daily (100 mg a day), acetylcysteine (NAC [ACETYLCYSTEINE]) taken as 600 mg, 1x/day (600mg once a day), Nattokinase taken as 2000 UNK, 1x/day (2000 fu once a day), ubidecarenone (COQ-10) taken as 100 mg, ergocalciferol (VIT D) taken as 4000 iu a day.  The patient reported that 10 minutes after the second shot she had breathing problems and was in the emergency room and then 40 minutes after that, she really decompensated. The caller treated it herself because she kept her inhaler, epi pen, and benadryl on her. She is cortisol dependent and had to take an extra 20mg of cortisol.

I was in the library at the time.  Several people ran to my side and sat me down on the floor. My O2 sat was 86, pulse 120. I was able to start breathing without epi. O2 went up to 100. Was taken to the ED and given Benadryl and Prednisone. I waited quite a long time. The ED was packed. I ended up leaving, as I felt fine. I am fine today and at work. This was my second vaccine.  No adverse event after the 1st dose.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Mar2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included exposure to SARS-COV-2 on 02Mar2021 (reported as &#34;daughter tested positive for COVID on 02Mar2021, patient had been around their daughter and their daughter&#39;s husband, they went out to eat with them on the night of 02Mar2021&#34;). Concomitant medication included esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 09Mar2021, the patient received her first shot. About 20 minutes after she took the shot, she started feeling bad and became nauseated/felt sick to stomach. On 09Mar2021, the top part of her stomach would hurt, and she started developing a cough. On 11Mar2021, the patient felt like she doesn&#39;t have any energy. The coughing went pretty bad so on 12Mar2021, the patient took a COVID-19 PCR test and it came back negative. The patient kept having a bad cough so then they went to the doctor where they put the patient on prednisone 20 mg and amoxicillin 875 mg on 12Mar2021. On 16Mar2021, the patient went to the family doctor and the doctor put the patient on azithromycin and gave her a steroid shot. Then the patient kept coughing and her stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage. The patient was never getting better or anything. So, on 18Mar2021, the patient had COVID-19 Virus test where they swabbed her nose and the test came back negative. The patient was taken to the hospital on 19Mar2021 at 11:30 where they did an x-ray of the patient&#39;s lungs and her O2 level was 82-86 sitting in the bed (also reported as 84-86 so she was put on oxygen), performed CT scan of her lungs and it looked like there was inflammation in the lower lungs that was rubbing on her diaphragm, and performed Chest CT which determined pneumonia. That night they did another COVID-19 virus test where they went really deep and it came back negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the night of 19Mar2021. The patient was given IV ceftriaxone, IV azithromycin, azithromycin (also reported as Zythromax), one breathing treatment, and they said they may have to send the patient home with some oxygen. It was also reported that on 19Mar2021, the patient did really good with coughing, she didn&#39;t cough that much. The patient had a dry cough that wasn&#39;t productive at all. The patient acted kind of short of breath because she wasn&#39;t breathing deep because of the pain in the top part of her stomach, but the reporter doesn&#39;t believe it was true shortness of breath. When the patient got out of the hospital on 22Mar2021, she didn&#39;t need to come home with the oxygen. The patient&#39;s oxygen level is running pretty good at the time of the report, in the lower 90s (Mar2021). The patient was on Decadron 6 mg for 5 days and she&#39;s doing pretty good, she still has a little bit of a cough. It was also reported that in Mar2021, the patient only ate about half of her breakfast, this lasted for several days, she wouldn&#39;t eat much. The patient pretty much recovered from the nausea. When she ate, it felt like everything would make it to her stomach and just sit there. The emergency room doctor said it could be from gastroenteritis, also they gave the patient several rounds of Protonix. The patient usually takes Nexium every night. The doctor felt that this event could very well be from the vaccine. The reporter asked if the patient could get the second shot on 30Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Cough/bad cough/dry cough&#34;, &#34;Stomach pain/top part of her stomach would hurt/stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage&#34;, and &#34;O2 level was 82-86/ Oxygen level was like 84 or 86 so she was put on oxygen&#34;; has recovered from &#34;nauseated/felt sick to stomach&#34; on an unspecified date.

I went to Urgent Care. They did a CBC to rule out internal bleeding, an ultrasound of stomach and an internal vaginal ultrasound. These tests were normal and they referred me to an obgyn, for an Endometrial Biopsy. This biopsy was completed on 3/17/21 and on 3/20/21, the results came back as normal. I am post-menopausal and have not had my period for about 10 years. I also submitted a report today to document the adverse event after my 2nd Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine that I got on 4/5/21.

                                                To summarize our conversation, you stated that you received the second Pfizer vaccine on 3/4/21.  Three days later, on 3/7/21, you began to have fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and chest pressure. Because all symptoms continued for 24 hours, on the evening of 3/8/21, you took yourself to the Emergency Department.  Your ER work-up included a CXR (negative), an EKG (showing a left bundle branch block), serum bloodwork (negative for MI), however, the D-dimer and spiral CT were both positive for a pulmonary emboli (i.e. a blood clot in your lungs).  You were admitted to the hospital and started on the blood thinner, Eliquis.  During your 3-day hospital stay, your work-up also included a bilateral lower extremity Doppler study (negative) and an echocardiogram (showing left ventricular hypertrophy).  You were discharged on all of your previously prescribed medications (see list below), except for the fish oil.  You were also started on Eliquis.  Since discharge, you have followed up with your PCP and have been referred to a cardiologist and pulmonologist.  To date, you have had no further symptoms.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, pre-diabetes.  PRE-VACCINE MEDICATIONS:  losartan, HCTZ, amlodipine, Welchol, fenofibrate, fish oil.  POST-ER VISIT MEDICATIONS:  losartan, HCTZ, amlodipine, Welchol, fenofibrate, Eliquis.

A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ENB207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 19Mar2021 08:00 AM (at the age of 59-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma since 1990, obese since 1990, Congestive heart failure about 4 years ago in 2017, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease since 1989; all were ongoing. She had a chemical exposure in a small town that started the COPD since about 1989. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received fluzone on unspecified date for flu vaccine and caused COPD exacerbation, she was given doxycycline and prednisone with that. The patient is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19, her first dose she received on 19Mar2021. She isn&#39;t going to take the second Covid 19 vaccine. On 19Mar2021 at 7:00PM on the day she received her Covid 19 vaccine her arm was killing her all the way down/ arm hurt so bad she wanted to cut it off. That lasted the whole next day and she took 2 Tylenol arthritis pills. Her arm was real sore the next day but it wasn&#39;t paining her like it was that first day. It was still a little sore but not like it was. The pain was down the whole arm.  Last week (on unspecified date in Mar2021), she started getting headaches and chills.  She&#39;ll get a chill and the chill will go away. Then a couple hours later the chills will come back. Her headache comes and goes. She checked her blood pressure and her blood pressure is normally low, she checked it and it was 117/76 in 2021. She knew her blood pressure wasn&#39;t causing her headaches. And she checked her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 and it was good. She normally does not have headaches. She&#39;s on 4L of oxygen because of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her breathing has been, she can&#39;t describe it. Her doctor prescribed some steroids yesterday, 30Mar2021. She is asking if this is normal after 2 weeks. When asking her about her breathing she reports it&#39;s like her chest is tighter and she has shortness of breath. If she moves, her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 drops with the slightest little movement. Her oxygen has been dropping into the 70s and she has to do the pursed lips breathing to recover. It&#39;s taking a while to recover. She has to really work to get her oxygen back into the 90s. That started last week some time. She did call her doctor and her doctor prescribed prednisone and doxycycline (Prednisone 4, 10 mg tablets for 3 days, then 3 tablets for 3 days, then 2 tablets for 3 days, then 1 tablet for 3 days and Doxycline Hyclate 100mg 1 capsule twice daily for 7 days). She forgot to mention that her left leg hurts from her knee to her hip on unspecified date in 2021. That started a couple days ago. She didn&#39;t have any problems with her hip before. She&#39;s scared because the second vaccine is more potent, it&#39;s worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;s going to get that second Covid 19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 59-year-old female patient (Non Pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 12:15 PM as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Graves Disease and seasonal allergy. Concomitant medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, liothyronine and seasonal allergy, etc. Allergies to medications, food, or other products: penicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Late night on Saturday 27Mar2021 23:45, the patient started getting cramps in abdomen, then she noticed blood in urine. Cramps subsided after Advil but work up the next morning with a blood flow. It&#39;s been 5 years since her last menstrual period, with very little spotting in those 5 years. It&#39;s been a week since the cramping and she was still getting dark (gross) spotting. This was very unusual for her body. Not sure if she should take the 2nd Pfizer shot. No treatment was received for the adverse event (except cramps in abdomen). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of cramps in abdomen was resolved with sequel. The outcome of others was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 59-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number ER8727, expiration date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 07Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy ( macro Danton, sulfa). Patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included Nerontin. The patient reviously received flu vaccine and had normal things, previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN5318; Expiration Date: 31May2021) in arm left on 17Mar2021 16:00 and experienced acute lymphatic response, brain fog and arm started to hurt. The pateint was calling because her doctor, who she saw yesterday 14Apr2021, told her she should let Pfizer know what was going on. She had a reaction to the Pfizer Covid19 Vaccine. she was now having PVCs. The patient added that all of the events started with a fever, and throwing up. She had a fever and threw up for 36 hours. She had to contact her physician to get medication and to stop vomiting and the nausea and everything. During that time, she was sick. She was having intermittent breathing issues which she did not think she felt too much of until after the other sickness was over. She was weak, like people get after they are sick, and had bizarre shaking legs and arms which was strange. She added that she had breathing issues and difficulty breathing and hard to get a breath. That was what she was dealing with. Treatment: caller took Pedialyte and all the proper things to get back into better shape. The breathing issue still remained. The doctor called in a rescue inhaler. She kept going downhill so he called in a rescue inhaler. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Caller added that this one will not be believed but on Monday, she woke up and got dressed again and was just weak and had breathing issues but was just doing work on the laptop. She did not fall, she did not run into anything. In the evening, she went to take a bath and saw that when she took her clothes off there was a large black bruise on her left breast, it was probably 2 inches in diameter. It is very large, but does not hurt like a bruise. She checked the rest of her body for blood issues and only saw a couple normal looking bruises. She contacted her doctor, and they questioned her thoroughly on her bruising and activity. This was on Monday. Tuesday, she still felt the same headache, weak, and breathing issues. PVCs (Ventricular premature beat) after second vaccine: Yesterday, 14Apr2021, she started declining and the doctor wanted to see her. Caller stated the doctor heard PVCs in her heart. Caller asked clarification of PVC abbreviation and does not provide. She never had heart issues ever. The doctor did blood work and a chest x-ray, and saw the bruise and was worried about her blood. Caller added that even though these are not listed as side effects of the vaccine, she was worried. Her doctor sent her to a facility for chest x-rays to make sure there is no pulmonary embolism. Caller confirmed this was on 14Apr2021. She has not yet heard back. PVCs after second vaccine: Caller added the doctor said her lungs sounded good but wanted to see what was going on to see how her breathing was because there was difficulty. The doctor wanted to cover bases and check. Today, caller can tell her heart is still not in correct rhythm and that it is in continued PVCs. She still had the same breathing issues, limbs were weak, she was shaky, and she is lightheaded. She was hoping to wake up today and feel better. Fever after second vaccine: started 3am 08Apr2021. She had a fever and was throwing up at this time. Throwing up and nausea after second vaccine: caller add that throwing up and vomiting with nausea occurred at 3 am, all of this occurred 08APR2021. The vomiting lasted 36 hours, and it ended when she took medication. The fever lasted 40 hours. Even after the medication worked for her fever, she had nausea. Around Friday was when it went away. Intermittent breathing issues after second vaccine: caller adds it started with throwing up and fever, but she did not think a lot about this or know when it started because she was dealing with the fever and vomiting. It continued, and it has not subsided or ended. As a matter of fact, there are 2 or 3 times it has gotten bad which is why she was given an inhaler. Treatments: caller took a Phenergan suppository, which she adds is the best medicine in the World for nausea and beats Zofran. She had used two or three doses and it did work. She used a rescue inhaler, Albuterol Sulfate HFA. She took Tylenol for fever. She is also now taking an aspirin daily because of the blood issues. No additional information regarding the products. Weak after second vaccine: caller adds that this started at the same time, she was over the nausea and noticed this. It felt different than what it feels like with the flu. This is still going on, she did not think too much about it but it has persisted. Sometimes there is a little bit of shaking but that is intermittent. Caller states she can not put it into words. Bizarre shaking legs and arms after second vaccine: this goes with the weakness, she is continually weak but she has a shaky feeling that will come every now and then and is random. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Monday this started, 12APR2021 and it is still there but it is the same. It has not been sore like a bruise but it is black and large. The physician has seen it now and it is bizarre and scary. It is the left breast on the outside.  Headache after second vaccine: started probably an hour after the vaccine, pretty quick. There were degrees to this headache because it was an actual migraine for a good 48 hours and even after the fever was gone it was terrible. It started out just a mild headache and then was very severe for a couple of days. Then, after that it was just there but not as severe. PVCs after second vaccine: caller adds that she went to the doctor yesterday 14APR2021 and she can tell every now and again that she is having these but there is nothing she can do about it. Caller adds this is everything new she can think of, but some of it is foggy, she thinks this is the main information. Brain fog after first and second vaccine: Caller then states, by the way, after both vaccines within 2 or 3 minutes of having them her head started feeling foggy and weird.  Investigations: caller has not received any results yet. She did get an EKG, Chest XRAY, blood work, and the doctor also rattled off a bunch of things the doctor was going to check. These all were on 14Apr2021 and she is waiting on results. Caller confirms the physician told her she had PVCs while listening to caller&#39;s heart. Did any AE require a visit to: Physician office? 15Apr2021 she was in contact with her physician, and the whole week they were on the phone. Yesterday 14Apr2021 the physician wanted to see her. The doctor figured out something was going on with her heart so thankfully the doctor wanted to see her. It was discussed if caller should go to the ER but caller did everything she could not to go because that is the last place she wants to go. Emergency Room: no. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of fever, vomiting, nausea was recovered, intermittent breathing issues, shaking legs and arms, weak, severe migraine, headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 59-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8737), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Apr2021 08:30 (at the age of 59years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (not bad enough that she takes treatment, but she is diagnosed; she was diagnosed way back in 2006). Concomitant products: patient stated she takes some medications (not further specified). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that she had her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 05Apr2021 and got very sick. She was down for two days and after day 10 (as reported) she has a blood clot under her eye. She would like to know what would happen if does not get a second dose. She consulted if there is any talk on whether or not people should receive an additional dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine next year. The patient further reported that on 06Apr2021 she woke up feeling crummy right away and a couple of hours into that day she couldn&#39;t lift her arm, literally couldn&#39;t lift arm for 6 inches and stated it went on for 2 days. She further stated that her arm hurt all the way below her arm pit into her breast. She stated that it all ended on 08Apr2021 and she went back to work on 08Apr2021. The patient added that she was down for two days, had headaches, and stated she never knew what people meant when they said they got hit by train. She doesn&#39;t believe she had a fever and couldn&#39;t move. The patient further stated that she got pretty darn sick and this morning 14Apr2021, she woke up with a blood clot under her eye. She is an esthetician and is pretty good with skin. She stated that she doesn&#39;t know how she could get this overnight unless she injured herself in her sleep, but she is a light sleeper. She does not know if it is a clot. She also stated that she called a medical esthetician who told her to take a baby aspirin and cold compress. The patient clarified that she didn&#39;t feel so good and today she feels better. She doesn&#39;t know that it is a blood clot, it is not raised and not hard, it looks like she has a bright red bruise in the corner of the eye to the middle of the eye underneath, not in the eye. She wants to make it clear she doesn&#39;t know if it is a blood clot. She feels like if she hurt herself, that would be the reason, but it would be painful, and it is not. She added that the bruise is about the same. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events (except for feeling down and couldn&#39;t move). The outcome of events thrombosis and contusion was not recovered; the outcome of other events was recovered on 08Apr2021.

She wouldn&#39;t call those spots a rash; itching kept her up all night/ She was up all night; rash and welts and the rash was moving up in her face; welts; hands started itching/itching moved up her arms and down her legs and then her whole body was itching; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 05Feb2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure and did have surgery in Jan2021, a week before she received the Covid 19 vaccine. She had screws placed in her foot. Her foot had been injured from being twisted too many times. It was an old injury. Concomitant medications included atenolol; omeprazole; venlafaxine; and hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HCTZ TEVA); all ongoing. Probably about 15 years ago, she received a flu vaccine where her husband worked. His place of employment offered flu vaccines to employees and their families every year. She went to get the flu vaccine and that was probably around 9:00AM and by the time she got off work that day she was so sick with the chills that she crawled into bed. It felt like she had the flu. The next day she felt better just worn out. She hasn&#39;t had a flu vaccine since then. She received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 05Feb2021 and about 20 minutes after (05Feb2021 13:50), she received the vaccine her hands started itching and she didn&#39;t think a lot about it. As time wore on, the itching moved up her arms and down her legs and then her whole body was itching. By Sunday, 07Feb2021 she had a rash and welts and the rash was moving up in her face. She went to the emergency room on Sunday, 07Feb2021 because the rash was on her face. She was getting scared. She was miserable. She was taking Benadryl and it wasn&#39;t doing anything for her. The emergency room gave her a Benadryl injection and liquid steroids and prescribed 2 epinephrine pens (Epi-pens) in case she started to have problems breathing. She did not have trouble breathing. She also received pills to help with her itching. She was still taking those pills because she was still itching. As of 23Apr2021, it was still persisting nothing has improved slightly. It keeps her up at night, making her miserable, and described it as severe. She had spots where she bleeds from scratching.  She was up all night two days ago because the itching was so bad.  The pills do help but she has to work so she can not take too many or she will be asleep at her desk. Patient hoped that Pfizer would have something to tell her healthcare provider about what to do for her. She was advised by her doctor to not get the second Covid 19 vaccine.  She went to her family doctor about a week later and explained what had happened with the Covid 19 vaccine and her doctor was able to review her emergency room visit paperwork. Her primary care doctor prescribed more of the pills for itching because she had gone through the pills that the emergency department prescribed. She reported that the rash has improved but at times, all of a sudden, she&#39;ll start itching and it&#39;s the type of itching that she can&#39;t stop scratching. With scratching it will grow into welts and a rash and then it goes away. She doesn&#39;t like to take the pills prescribed for itching because she doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. The itching kept her up all night in different parts of her body. The itching will ease down and then the itching will stop and then probably a good hour will pass and the rash will go away. The only thing that was left to see was where she scratched on her body. She still has red spots on her arms that weren&#39;t there before. She wouldn&#39;t call those spots a rash. The pill she was prescribed for itching is Hydroxyzine 25mg take one by mouth every 6 hours as needed for itching. This one helps but she doesn&#39;t want to take it because it can make her tired and she has to work. Outcome of the event &#34;hands started itching/itching moved up her arms and down her legs and then her whole body was itching&#34; was not recovered while unknown for other events.

                                                I was hospitalized for bilateral pulmonary embolism 4/18/2021 at hospital. I think I had symptoms for over 3 weeks prior to hospitalization. I was rapid COVID tested on 3/26/2021 the nurse at CVS asked why my blood oxygen was low. I did not know but had me pant and move my fingers and it went up to 96. I also remember severe leg pain on a drive 3/25/21. I noticed shortness of breath 4/5/21 and fast pulse but didnot go to hospital until 4/18/21. I previously had a PE 7/2009 and also had it for ~2 weeks before going to hospital. I was not on blood thinner since 2015. The doctors at the hospital and primary care doctor did not seem to think the PE was vaccine related but they also do not believe I had symptoms for over 3 weeks.

The patient received her second Covid 19 vaccination on March 11 but was experiencing some myalgias.  She had multiple sick contacts at home with COVID-19 infection.  Unfortunately she had diarrhea and poor p.o. intake and developed dehydration.  She came to the emergency department for further evaluation after she had her vital signs at home and saw her heart rate was elevated and her blood pressure was low.  She was found to have a sinus tachycardia with hypotension upon arrival despite the fact that she has been holding her blood pressure medications for several days.  She was hypokalemic.  Covid swab came back positive.  She was given IV fluids and potassium was replaced her blood pressure remained on the lower side.  She was admitted to the hospital and started on steroids.  She met criteria for remdesivir and convalescent plasma with saturation at 90% on room air on the second day of her admission.  She completed a 5-day course of remdesivir.  She was given a unit of convalescent plasma.  Her potassium normalized.  Her heart rate normalized.  She had a better oral intake.  Metoprolol tartrate was started on a lower dose for blood pressure and heart rate control.  Her blood pressure remained in the normal range off her lisinopril and Norvasc.  She does have history of Leiden 5 and with a history of DVT and takes Xarelto.  She had a D-dimer which was checked which was normal.  She continued on her Xarelto as an inpatient.  She has clinically improved and is now ready for discharge.  She is agreeable to remote patient monitoring and that has been arranged.  She should follow-up with her family doctor in 1 week.  Her lisinopril and Norvasc were discontinued at discharge.  I have recommended close follow-up with her family doctor to reintroduce these medications as needed pending on blood pressure trend.   _ Labs/Imaging   LABORATORY:   CBC:  Results from last 7 days Lab Units 03/22/21 0629 03/21/21 1224 03/20/21 1528 03/19/21 0550 WBC AUTO K/mcL 5.8 6.2 4.4 3.8* HEMOGLOBIN g/dL 13.8 13.4 12.7 12.2 HEMATOCRIT % 41.1 39.9 38.9 37.3 PLATELETS K/mcL 237 204 187 147 NEUTROS PCT AUTO % 63  --  81 75 LYMPHO PCT MAN %  --  17  --   --  LYMPHS PCT AUTO % 29  --  14 18 MONO PCT MAN %  --  2  --   --  MONOS PCT AUTO % 6  --  3 6 EOSINO PCT MAN %  --  0  --   --  EOS PCT AUTO % 0  --  0 0     CHEMISTRY:  Results from last 7 days Lab Units 03/22/21 0629 03/21/21 0642 03/20/21 1529 03/19/21 0550 SODIUM mmol/L 141 140 138 143 POTASSIUM mmol/L 3.8 3.9 3.6 3.6 CHLORIDE mmol/L 105 106 106 110* CO2 mmol/L 28 26 21 24 BUN mg/dL 18 18 16 8 CREATININE mg/dL 0.77 0.79 0.81 0.71 CALCIUM mg/dL 8.7 8.9 8.6 8.3* TOTAL PROTEIN gm/dL 7.1 7.2  --  7.1 BILIRUBIN TOTAL mg/dL 0.3 0.4  --  0.4 ALK PHOS IU/L 103 101  --  106* ALT IU/L 12 15 | 15 14 15 AST IU/L 15 17  --  22    Results from last 7 days Lab Units 03/20/21 1529 03/19/21 0550 03/18/21 0601 MAGNESIUM mg/dL 1.9 2.2 2.0     COAGULATION:      OTHER TESTS: No results found for: TROPONINI     IMAGING: X-ray Chest 1 View - Portable   Result Date: 3/17/2021 XR CHEST 1 VW PORT IMPRESSION: Limited patchy bibasilar airspace disease, right worse than left.
