                                                December 28,(before the vaccine) I was exposed to COVID at work.  I started feeling feverish on Monday at work. I needed to use my inhaler twice that day. I couldn&#39;t stop coughing at work. At home that night - used inhaler again and I had an elevated temperature - 99. something is high for me. I missed work on Tuesday. Couldn&#39;t breathe and it hurt my chest to breathe. My temp was over 100. Dr appt - went to it late afternoon he wanted me test for COVID. Took vitals - mostly normal - temp.; checked OXYGEN - normal. COVID test - was positive. Temperature went to 101 that night - couldn&#39;t breathe good - couldn&#39;t stop shaking; I was aching and I was in pain; I couldn&#39;t feel warm enough. Tried to sleep and drink fluids. Still didn&#39;t have test results from COVID test on Thursday - temp was up to 102 now. The doctor said they couldn&#39;t do anything until they had results back of test. Friday - 101 and 102.8 - temperature that day. After hours clinic - I called them - Dr - I had to gasp for every breath and I was coughing a lot. He prescribed Benzymidate - cough pearls and Azithromycin  - started taking those that night. By Sunday afternoon, my fever continued and I still didn&#39;t have COVID results yet.  My mom took me to  Urgent Care on Sunday - still running fever; he looked at my lungs and listened -  he could hear wheezing and crackling in my lungs - he determined pneumonia - he didn&#39;t know what kind - he gave me Augmentin - he told me to use both my Albuterol inhaler and steriod haler;  Mucinex expectorant twice a day; Vit C and Vit D and Elderberry and Tylenol and two antibiotics. Saturday - before I went to Urgent Care on Sunday - I noticed I couldn&#39;t smell.  Monday is when I got the positive test for COVID.   Provided info to work and I tried to figure out how to work. Even though I was still very sick, I worked again online on Monday. But I couldn&#39;t keep working - got really whoozy; coughing and gasping  felt like I was going to pass out and felt like I could hardly breathe.  My mom called 911 for me. I managed to get to the bathroom - but having trouble breathing and I almost threw up - heard ringing in my ears and room was spinning. There is a lot of things after that I don&#39;t remember - when they moved me to ambulance to hospital  bed I realized I had an IV in me.  They stabilized me. They let me go home. I took the rest of the week off from work. Took a lot of medication and was keeping up with my vital during that week - 99.8 - 102.8 - for ten days I ran that fever. Broke Jan 20th. I went back to work on Jan 25. Still had to use an inhaler a lot. I&#39;m slowly getting taste back; I can&#39;t taste flavor but can taste salt . I&#39;m slowly getting smell back. I still have a lot of congestion but not as bad. Ears were bothering me this weekend so I did go to urgent care on they put me on a third antibiotic for an ear infection. Gave COVID to my son and my mother. Still have trouble catching me breath. January 23  - my isolation was extended to . the county extended my isolation period because of my family getting COVID. I&#39;m about 75% recovered, I&#39;d say.

I began bleeding and cramping and having headaches approximately 10 days after my second dose. I sought medical attention and was told that my baby no longer had a heart beat and that growth (based on ultrasound) had stopped around the 9 week mark. I had medical assistance to physically miscarry the deceased fetus. I have one healthy living son (2 years,  4 months old) who was delivered without complications naturally.

                                                My first dose was 1/14. I found out I was pregnant on 1/26/21 and I miscarried at about 10 weeks. About 15 mins after I got the vaccine, I had a racing heartrate and my palms were hot, but it went away. Around 3pm, I had a right frontal headache. I took a nap and it went away. About 5am Fri, I woke up to severe arm pain and it felt like I was being stabbed in the stomach. I took about 400mg of Ibuprofen, went to sleep and was fine when I woke up. About 5pm Friday, I began having vaginal bleeding. I called my doctor and was able to get in on Feb 11th. At my OB/GYN appointment, they tested my blood and urine, which confirmed my pregnancy. The NP examined me and told me that the bleeding was coming from my cervix, so they sent me for an ultrasound the following week. That&#39;s when I was given my calculated date of 10 weeks. A gestational sac was observed, but they weren&#39;t sure if a fetus was present. I had to see my doctor every week since I was still bleeding and that continued until March 18th, when I lost the pregnancy completely. I took my specimen to the doctor the following day. They told me that they were sending it out to be tested, but I&#39;m not sure if the results are back. They did confirm that it was a fetus.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting my vaccine I noticed the roof of my mouth itching as well as my tongue and back of my throat.  I waited to see if it would go away and then a couple minutes later noticed my lips started itching and swelling and from there it just got worse.  I told the nurse practitioner that I think I was having a reaction, she had me take a seat told her my entire mouth throat &amp; lips felt swollen and itching and she looked and said it was full blown anaphylaxis reaction.  Administered EpiPen, benadryl and called ambulance where they took me to medial emergency department.

On 1/11 she had intermittent chest pain that lasted a few days and started to notice small purpura rash on left breast.  She didn&#39;t think much of it but noticed the same type of rash on her pant line and then right thigh.  On 1/15 she called Occupational Health who advised her to go straight to the ED.

Went to ER on Feb 15th, and ultrasound revealed a blood clot near the junction of the subclavian vein and cephalic veins.  Diagnosis was idiopathic subclavian deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Started on enoxaparin and warfarin on Feb 15th.  Referred to hematology and coumadin clinic to monitor INR.

                                                Short Summary: DVT followed by Multiple Bilateral Pulmonary Embolisms (significant blood clots in both lungs). Context: After the first vaccine (about a week before my second vaccine), I self diagnosed myself with a calf injury due to extreme pain in my calf that felt like a continuous cramp. The extreme pain lasted until my second shot (about a week). When going for my second shot, I reported a rash with hives on my lower abdomen that had appeared within five hours of my first shot, so they requested I stay a little longer for observation. That night I began having some breathing difficulties, but assumed they were to be expected. The breathing difficulties continued to get worse until my nurse practitioner told me to go directly to the nearest ER (2/16/21), where I was officially diagnosed with multiple bilateral pulmonary embolisms. I was admitted to healthcare facility for 24-48 hours, until an EKG revealed heart abnormalities that caused them to use a physician&#39;s transport to move me to another unit. I was discharged from the hospital on 2/2/21 after I stabilized from heparin shots, avoiding more invasive procedures. I have been in ongoing recovery since then, receiving ongoing care from a hematologist and pulmonologist. A little extra context for you - I arrived to the hospital with diabetic ketoacidosis and have an endocrinologist since hospitalization that has diagnosed me with Type 1 Diabetes (previously misdiagnosed as type 2 - I&#39;m now on insulin which is controlling my blood glucose well).

                                                anaphylactic reaction; not able to breathe or talk; Her throat was closing up; This is a spontaneous report from contactable pharmacists and an other hcp and a nurse. A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EN5318) intramuscularly on 25Jan2021 15:15 in right deltoid at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. No known allergies. Concomitant medications included high blood pressure medication. Patient was not able to breathe or talk. Her throat was closing up. They had to use epinephrine to help her breath. It was reported as anaphylactic reaction. The vaccine was administered at 15:15, patient was interacting with HCPs who asked basic questions and at some point (15:17) patient was not responsive, patient was not able to breath and talk. All events started from 25Jan2021 15:17. Patient was administered Epipen (also reported as Benadryl and Epinephrine) and &#34;she came back&#34;. Patient was taken to hospital. Patient refused to call an ambulance. She was taken to hospital. The patient was not seen in the Emergency Department. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. No other vaccine in four weeks. No covid prior vaccination. Unknown if covid tested post vaccination. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient has not received any other vaccines around the time of bnt162b2 vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included heart rate with result of went up as soon as epipen was administered, O2 saturation and vitals with unknown results, all on 25Jan2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Two days after the 2nd injection I started to have chest pain and not feel right. I went to the Station where I volunteer. I did and EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I went to the ER. They gave me 4 baby aspirin to take and some blood work. I was told the blood work showed elevated levels consistent with a blood clot as well. I had a CT scan to rule out a clot in my heart or lungs. Which it was negative. I was released and told to see a cardiologist in the next few days. I saw the cardiologist two days later who said I ended up with Pericarditis and that it should resolve on its own. I was feeling better until two days ago when I developed chest pain again. I again went to my fire station I volunteer for and did an EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I am currently waiting for treatment from my cardiologist.

The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) on 29Jan2021, which caused hospitalization for 5 days from an unspecified date to an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, which included direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC). The clinical outcome of DVT and PE was recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 or comirnarty in triggering the onset of Deepvein thrombosis,pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.But also consider relevant medical history of hypertension and fibroids tendency to form blood clots and concomitant medications also have possible contributory role. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 42-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 19Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL3249) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included post-partum hypothyroidism. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 29Dec2020 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient stated &#34;The day after second vaccine and that week, I had chills, aches, fever 101, left neck and chest swollen lymph nodes, stomach aches. 28Jan2021, I started having severe left flank pain and abdominal pain. On 04Feb2021, I had a heart attack, was in V-fib arrest, and subsequently found to have fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), which caused 3 artery dissections and narrowing of other arteries. Did not know I had FMD prior to the heart attack. Most people who have FMD never show signs or symptoms and don&#39;t know they have it. Others with FMD have it affect maybe one artery. Something caused my FMD to go into overdrive, affecting 3 arteries. It also affected a renal artery, causing lack of blood to my left kidney, causing part of that kidney to die - that was my 28Jan2021 pain. Coincidental my FMD acted up this way a little over a week after receiving the second Pfizer shot?&#34; Events were reported as serious and resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient hospitalization for 9 days. Treatment received for all events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-CoV-2 test (Nasal Swab): negative on an unknown date (Covid test post vaccination). The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This 43-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), (Lot number: EL1285) via intramuscular route on 29Dec2020 14:30 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anxiety. No known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Patient hospitalized for stroke on 31Dec2020 two days after vaccine (Days of hospitalization: 4). Day of vaccine-6 hours after patient had dizzy and lightheaded for about 45 min then went away. On 31Dec2020 at 19:15 had sudden loss of hearing to right ear and severe dizziness, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and felt like fainting. Paramedics were called-sent to ER, had CTA which showed partial blockage and received TPA. Treatment included TPA, fluids, medications, hospital stay, outpatient follow ups, physical therapy. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. Patient has been tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: Negative and Pixel: Negative on 08Jan2021. Outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events including stroke, dizzy/lightheaded/felt like fainting, difficulty breathing, vomiting, and sudden loss of hearing to right, and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the patient&#39;s underlying medical conditions, relevant lab tests would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

                                                I was approximately 4 weeks pregnant at the time that I received dose #1 (12/23/20)- I was unaware of the pregnancy. I was diagnosed with COVID on 12/28/20, but was first symptomatic on 12/24. I attributed my s/s initially to the vaccine. I was eventually tested on 12/28/20, as my symptoms worsened and I was positive for COVID.  On 1/14/21 I received my second dose, my COVID s/s had been resolved since 1/4/21. On the evening of 1/18/21 I started experiencing mild abdominal pain. This progressed, on the evening 1/20 the pain was no longer tolerable. I went to the ER where I hemorrhaged and needed emergency surgery and a blood transfusion for a miscarriage. The surgery ultimately took place in the early morning hours of 1/22/21, followed by the blood transfusion.

I&#39;m in healthcare and in the operating often for airway and ENT procedures.  I received my shot at 9:00am on 1/29/20201 and began spotting at 11:00am.  The spotting continued (very light) until 9:00pm.  I decided to go to bed since I wasn&#39;t feeling well.  I woke at 2:00am with contractions and heavy bleeding.  I went to the ED at 3:00am on 1/30 to confirm my miscarriage.  I weighed 121 at the ED when triaged. My EDD was 08/19/2021

The joints that do normally hurt were way worse (my back, and right big toe joint). There was a pain in my right eye, and that eye had blood vessels burst in it.  36 hours after the shot= started bleeding from my vagina. My last menstruation was 2 weeks ago and this is VERY unusual for me. Normally my periods are 30-32 days apart.

This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

A 43-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 15Jan2021 at 06:30 (at the age of 43-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 (with taste and smell loss). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and duloxetine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 17Dec2020 at 14:00 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization and experienced head to toe itching and progress with taste and smell disappeared/worse than COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced mild anaphylactic reaction on 16Jan2021 at 20:00 and itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss on an unspecified date. The patient reported that all the progress she made with taste and smell, disappeared after the vaccine and was actually worse than when she got COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild anaphylactic reaction, which included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The clinical outcome of mild anaphylactic reaction was not recovered and of itching throat, cough, and taste and smell loss was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known safety profile, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

                                                Starting on February 24, 2021, I started to have shortness of breath. This slowly got worse until on March 2, 2021 I was unable to breathe in all the way and was getting a sharp pain in my side/back when I tried to breathe in more than half way. I then went to the emergency room recognizing the symptom as likely being a pulmonary embolism, as I had experienced one four years earlier. It was, in fact, a PE. I was in the hospital for five days as they treated the clots with blood thinners. I slowly got my breathing more back to normal and was discharged. They are still runnying myriad tests to try to determine the cause or causes, but I thought it wise to report here in case the vaccine is a factor. I received my second dose on 2/26/21, a few days before I went to the hospital but my symptoms started a few days before that.

Immediately following the statement I was having difficulties speaking, slurred speech, and my body felt weighted. This lasted 2 minutes. This experience happened two more times so we left for the ER. Another episode happened while checking in the ER and they responded as if I was having a stroke. A 5th episode happened while in the ER waiting for a room and a 6th time after admission in the room with a nurse. This last episode was at 1:00pm on 3/5/2021. I could feel each of these coming on.

A 43-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm in the morning of 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8727) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing complex regional pain syndrome, ongoing fibromyalgia, ongoing arthritis - all diagnosed 20 years ago. Her mother has lupus and rheumatoid arthritis and she can&#39;t have the vaccine, states she doesn&#39;t know if something could be genetic. Low potassium in the past and stated that she has a lot of allergies to medications, but she consulted with the pharmacist and he said it would be okay. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccine was administered on the same date of BNT162B2 and no prior vaccination within four weeks. The patient was having weird symptoms and she tried looking online and in different groups to find out if anyone has similar symptoms, but she hasn&#39;t been able to find anything. She began by saying she has health issues; she has Fibromyalgia and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. She doesn&#39;t know if studies were performed on patients with those disorders that took the vaccine. It&#39;s been about 3 weeks since getting the vaccine (Apr2021) and she started having symptoms that she thought could be a blood clot. From the knees down, she was having a lot of pain, cramps, burning from her calf to her feet. She would keep rubbing them and massaging them. It was excruciating pain. She was having symptoms and she did go see her Nurse Practitioner on 14Apr2021 because she thought she was having a stroke or a clot or something in her legs or that she was having a problem with her cholesterol. The nurse thought maybe it was her electrolytes, because she had low potassium in the past, but everything came back normal. Her feet were painful but not as bad in Apr2021. She felt like her condition but it&#39;s flaring up like 200% it&#39;s like over a 10 on the pain scale. She can&#39;t think right, she can&#39;t work, and was very uncomfortable in Apr2021. The leg pain felt like it is really deep in the vein, it doesn&#39;t feel like it is superficial, and she can feel stuff or liquid flowing. Her pain alternates from her head to her neck to her feet and it is very uncomfortable. Her hands and feet started to go numb, not completely numb but like when they fall asleep from sitting on them and then hit something and it hurts. Her arms were burning like crazy; they itch, they burn in Apr2021. Different temperatures like hot and cold make it painful, bad and irritating, and she can&#39;t sleep well because of her symptoms. She doesn&#39;t know the exact dates, but it has been about a week, but it is changing. It started with cramps in her legs from her knees down. That is where she had injuries and she thought it was her cholesterol. From her knees down, she has cramps and pain and it is very uncomfortable, she felt a really deep pain. She has pain in her neck then to her back, it started in her lower extremities and it is going up. It has stayed the same and she has to keep taking Tylenol to control the pain. Her symptoms got worse and she started taking Tylenol and that helped and then on 15Apr2021, her hands and feet started going numb and she had a headache and pain on the top portion of her head (reported as brain) and her hands hurt, and she was nauseous. She hasn&#39;t heard back from the nurse practitioner, so she decided not to go and get it done because she felt it is from the vaccine. She also has swelling of feet in Apr2021, and now she just woke up an hour ago and she slept somewhat okay, but she had to take Tylenol. Now that she is standing, it felt like her legs are starting to hurt again. Treatment included Tylenol, which helps a little and she has to keep taking it. If she doesn&#39;t take Tylenol, she can&#39;t even function. The events from the knees down I was having a lot pain/leg pain felt like it is really deep in the vein, cramps, my hands and feet started going numb, they itch they burn, feet are painful, uncomfortable, pain on the top of my head and my hands hurt/headache, swelling in her feet, nauseous, pain in her neck then to her back, different temperatures like hot and cold make it bad and irritating had not resolved, while the event can&#39;t sleep well because of her symptoms was resolving, and the outcome rest of the events was unknown.

A week after #2 my menstrual cycles (which have been clockwork all of my life-I have 4 children and track it monthly)  became much more frequent and heavy with excessive clotting. I thought perhaps I was going though early menopause (44) but then realized correlation with vaccine. My mood changed, I feel sad all of the time, I am dreading recommendation of additional shots.

A 44-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELI283), via an unspecified route of administration single dose on 12Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation. First dose was received on 22Dec2020 10:00 left arm (lot# EJI695). Medical history included chronic skin condition. No other vaccine was received in four weeks.  Concomitant medications included oxycodone for pain, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D). The patient experienced myocardial infarction on 10Feb2021 20:00, very high troponin levels (4.79 &amp; 12.49) on 11Feb2021, repeat episodes of chest pain on 10Feb2021 20:00, heart attack on 10Feb2021 20:00, thrombus formation on 10Feb2021 20:00, coagulopathy on 10Feb2021 20:00. The patient was hospitalized due to the events from 11Feb2021. Patient reported to be a healthy 44 year old woman with no history of hypertension or high cholesterol. She was now on 7 different medications to protect her heart, including blood thinners and antihypertensives that result in daily headaches and fatigue. She had had several repeat episodes of chest pain which has required taking sublingual nitroglycerin. She was off work for an undetermined amount of time. Her primary care physician was baffled by her case and reached out to a number of experts who have agreed that her heart attack was caused by a thrombus formation/coagulopathy most definitely related to the Covid vaccines she received.  The events outcome was recovered with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  myocardial infarction and other events. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this 44-years-old patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline and during subject drug therapy, echocardiogram, electrolytes, chemistry panel and coronary angiogram, and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                nausea; vomiting; chest pain; myocarditis; thrombocytopenia; This is a Literature-spontaneous report 2021, 1-4; entitled Thrombocytopenia following Pfizer and Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. A 44-year-old woman was hospitalized for nausea, vomiting and chest pain on the day that she received the Pfizer vaccine (BNT162B2) via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number unknown) at single dose (at 44-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Her laboratory values included a platelet count of 85 x 109/L and a peak troponin level of 4 ng/mL (normal &lt; = 0.04 ng/mL). The patient was diagnosed with myocarditis but did not require treatment for thrombocytopenia. Her platelets were 61 x 109/L on discharge, but subsequent platelet counts were not reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information on Lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal association cannot be excluded between the reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine use. The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for AE. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, ethics committees and investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 4 hours after the first vaccine, numbness and tingling all over the body. Left arm went completely numb and tingling. Scalp tingling and numb. Felt like circulation was cut off. Severe Shortness of breath. Extreme feeling of adrenaline. The next day on March 14th, had extreme vaginal bleeding on day 14 of cycle. Bled for another 7 days which led to extreme anemia. The shortness of breath is every day since the first dose. Heart palpitations (heart rate went up to 190!). After the second dose on 4/03, all symptoms got worst. Left leg went completely numb the same day which I went to the emergency room for. The neurological tingling and numbness was spreading to my whole body. Arms, legs, face, ears, scalp, inside my head. I was worried for a heart attack since all of my symptoms of left arm and shoulder pain and numbness etc. I was released from the emergency room 12 hours later. I continued to have severe symptoms. The shortness of breath was so bad that I didn&#39;t sleep for 2 nights straight because my oxygen would drop. I also had severe insomnia and no appetite and lost 5 pounds in 1 week. Major adrenaline feeling. I went back to the emergency room 2 more times this week to check out my heart and lungs. All of my doctors recommended ER since they couldn&#39;t help me. My neurologist said he is getting lots of these symptoms from people post vaccine.  My shortness of breath and elevated heart rate and numbness and tingling are still here and I can barely go up and down stairs without being out of breath and having a 130-140 heart rate and super low blood pressure and night sweats. It is awful.

She thought it was her period but it stopped during the night (she mentioned she worked that night). She asked if this was a side effect from the vaccine. It was light, like when a person&#39;s period was coming but it was a brownish color, not red. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No treatment given to the patient for the event.

She was getting vitals and CIW  checked regularly.  First dose of  chlordiazepoxide 25mg was 2/4 at 1:25pm for CIWA 9.  She had repeat vitals at  5:50pm, CIWA 1, vitals: P 67, 118/79, 94% on RA, T 98.3.  she had complained of  some &#34;pressure in her head&#34; and feeling anxious, but otherwise denied other  complaints.  she was talking with others in the group, then other patients report  she suddenly started having seizure like activity around 6:45pm, med techs came  to help and found her stiff, gurgling.  they tried to get vitals on her, called  911, noticed that at 6:54pm she had lost a pulse and they started CPR.  paramedics arrived at 7:08pm and she was brought to ED.   Pt BIBA in cardiac arrest. Pt was at Detox Center when she  was reported to have seizure-like activity followed by collapse. She  was found to be pulseless and CPR initiated by staff members. EMS  arrived and performed approx 15 min of CPR and gave pt epi x 3 and  bicarb. No shocks administered but they did not report a rhythm.   In the emergency room the patient arrived and was found to be pulseless with PEA arrest, CPR was initiated, patient was intubated. ROSC ultimately achieved, patient remained very acidotic despite ventilator adjustment, head CT revealed cerebral edema. Pt also found to be profoundly anemic with a hemoglobin of 5 and platelets of 37, she was thought to be GI bleeding so medications for this were initiated. Patient then became more hypoxemic with bradycardia, consultation with neurosurgery and critical care medicine at tertiary care center deemed ongoing CPR futile. Patient arrested at 2:30AM on 2/5, pronounced dead at 2:48AM.

                                                I had my second vaccine on Monday, 3/22, and woke up at 1am on Thursday 3/25 with extreme chest pain, shortness of breath, sweating and chills.  I went to the ER, and they discovered two blood clots in my lungs.  I&#39;ve never had pulmonary embolisms before, so this is a very strange coincidence.  I am in cancer treatment, so my risk of PEs is higher, but the timing is too close for me not to think that the second vaccine traumatized my immune system, causing the PEs.

A 45-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 15Jan2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the first dose on 29Dec2020 in the left arm for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines in four weeks. Medical history included allergies: Sulfa. Patient was not pregnant at the time of report. The patient has not had COVID prior vaccination and was not tested post vaccination. Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (SEASONIQUE) taken for birth control. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis in right calf on 13Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. The event deep vein thrombosis in right calf resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received aspirin regimen as treatment for the event deep vein thrombosis in right calf.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, the event deep vein thrombosis most likely represents an intercurrent medical condition and was unrelated to Bnt162b2 vaccine. A possible contributory role of concomitant drug ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel to the event can not be totally excluded. Case will be re-assessed upon the additional information provided. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                immune system was low; shingles; heart attack; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) via Medical Information, also received via Pfizer-sponsored program. A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Mar2021 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Within 5 hours after receiving the dose, she developed shingles on 23Mar2021. She stated the pain was so bad she thought she was having a heart attack on an unspecified date in 2021. Her medical doctor (MD) told her that she should get the second dose of the vaccine and that the shingles was dormant in her system and because her &#34;immune system was low&#34; she developed the shingles outbreak. The patient further stated that she developed shingles 4 hours later after receiving the first dose. She stated that the eruptions have stopped but it was still painful. She was asking if she should get the second covax or wait. The patient had not yet recovered from shingles while outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 26 Mar2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat, my blood pressure was high, my throat was closing, she experienced body aches and at home she started wheezing/bilateral wheeze. Within minutes of receiving the vaccine, my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat and she had a weird sensation in her throat, 15 minutes later she was not able to form words. The patient was given liquid Benadryl (oral) for my tongue swelled up to the back of my throat and her symptoms resolved. She went to the nurse station, who took her BP which was high, which it normally is not so the treating physician felt confident in letting me go home. She was monitored for an hour and was sent home with no more tongue swelling. At home she started wheezing. She called her HCP and was advised to take a nebulizer with no effect. At around 14:00, when the Benadryl wore off, her throat was closing so she was directed to epi-pen herself and call 911. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital and treated for anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine. She was given prednisone 50mg by mouth daily for four days and a refill for her Epipen. No additional Epipen was administered. On 29Mar2021, the patient experienced skin hurting like a neuropathy, chills and she experienced a rash.

A 47-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 08:49 (at the age of 47-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   There were no known medical history or concomitant medications.  The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Dec2020 (Lot Number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization and experienced nausea, headache, and fatigue. On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took Benadryl, an epinephrine pen, and a nebulizer and began to start feeling better in 15 minutes. Following the 2 weeks I felt nauseous, chills, cold sweat, lightheaded, weak, tired, headache and pain in arm/shoulder.

                                                47-year-old female presented for anaphylactic allergic reaction after getting her first dose of Covid19 vaccine.  Patient was initially seen by Dr., who then signed out to me pending observation and reevaluation.  In summary, patient had received total of 2 EpiPen 1 at home and 1 in the ED in conjunction with soluMedrol, Benadryl, and Pepcid.  Patient has history of anxiety and jittery as well as nervousness after epinephrine.  Patient was then given 1 mg p.o. Ativan for her symptom.     On my evaluation, patient is not in respiratory distress, She is still  Tachycardic in the 110s-120s  Which is likely from the EpiPen.  Patient stated that she normally stays tachycardic for a while after the epipen.  Patient otherwise not in respiratory distress, her posterior pharynx and her uvula is not swelling.  Patient also has no wheezing on auscultation exam.  We discussed the possibility of staying in the hospital under observation versus going home.  Patient reported she is back at baseline and would like to be discharged and I was in agreement with this plan. Patient does has 3 more epipen at home to use for worsening symptoms. She will be prescribed medrol dose pack. Red flags signs and symptoms were discussed with strict return instruction were given. Patient verbalized understanding and was in agreement with the plan. She was then discharged in stable condition.

Had pain and throbbing in leg couldn?t sleep with pain so on  the evening of March 3rd I went to urgent care . Doctor didn?t think it was blood clot because I had no swelling or redness in my leg but gave me a script for ultrasound. I couldn?t get an appointment until  the morning of March 5th . Was diagnosed with a very large blood clot in lower leg  going up past my knee. I am now in Eliquis blood thinner for 3 months while they run tests

                                                After ten minutes my throat began to feel swollen, a feeling of a lump in my throat.  After around 20 minutes I also began to feel more light headed/dizzy.  I was moved to be observed by a nurse for another 20 minutes and when symptoms did not subside I was moved to the Emergency Department where they administered Epinephrine at 9:27am, Pepcid, 9:24am, Solu-medrol 9:24-10:50am.  Diagnosis: Anaphylaxis. Dr. wanted to prescribe Benadryl IV but I declined as I needed to drive home and the facility was far from home. I was discharged around 1:00pm.   A prescription for an Epi Pen was made by Dr.  and filled that day at pharmacy.  and spoke to my Dr. at another healthcare organization at 4:30pm.  Benadryl OTC was then rx&#39;d by my primary care doctor at 4:30pm-50mg every 6 hrs moving to 25 mg every 6 hours the next day.   Symptoms of swollen throat continued into the next day and have not yet abated but also have not worsened. Due to continued throat swelling I have taken 50mg of Benadryl the next day as well. Dr. my primary care Dr. scheduled an allergist appt for Feb. 3, 2021 and advised I should not get the second dose of the COVID19 vaccine until I speak with an allergist and have a treatment plan developed.

                                                Within a short time after receiving my COVID vaccination, I experienced a burst of energy, pretty severe abdominal cramping, and vaginal bleeding (small amount; very close location-wise to being internal but was external). Bleeding lasted until bedtime and was gone, along with the abdominal cramping and burst of energy by the next morning and has never returned.  Vaccine #2 was on 2/9/21 and the only difference I felt after that one was tiredness; took a 3 hour nap shortly after I returned home and never noticed anything else since.  (Not sure if this helps to know...I had a hysterectomy mid-October, 2020.)

                                                &#34;I received the Pfizer Covid vaccine Wed afternoon around 4pm. Thursday morning around 9:30 I started with severe pain in my left leg. The pain worsened through the day and my leg began swelling. No other symptoms at all. This morning my leg was twice the size of my right leg so I went to the ER. I live in so I&#39;m at ED. I have a massive blood clot running the the length of my leg - from my thigh to my ankle. I&#39;m very lucky I got here so fast! I?m a very healthy 49 year old with no history of DVT or blood clots so they dug further to find out why. A cat scan showed I have a congenital condition called May Thurner Syndrome. I?m so relieved to have an answer and it?s fixable! The vascular doctors are not 100% convinced that?s not all that was going on as I was born with the syndrome and I?ve gone this long without a clot. So they are doing lots of labs to see if anything else shows up. This is where we are at. I?m being admitted to take care of the clot.&#34;

                                                she thought she had a blood clot; maybe it is MS (multiple sclerosis); possible septal infarct; weakness in her left arm; losing her balance; vaccine was given up high on her arm, not 2 fingers down. She thought they had hit bone; less range of movement in her left foot; trouble walking; like someone who had a stroke; numbness; legs felt heavy climbing stairs; immediate pain when needle went all the way in and worse when vaccine went in; pain in shoulder joint; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: Ep6955), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Mar2021 18:00 (at the age of 49years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Medical history included anemia that is treated, living kidney donor, gastric bypass in 1999, gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, intussusception x2, migraines, high heart rate, and smoking. Concomitant medications included omeprazole (OMEPRAZOLE), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine and Tetanus vaccine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. She got the shot on 25Mar2021 on Thursday evening at 1800. She is 49 years old and has had all the flu shots and tetanus shots. She has never had one hurt so bad. She stated that the vaccine was given up high on her arm, not 2 fingers down. She thought they had hit bone. It was reported that the patient experienced immediate pain when needle went all the way in and worse when vaccine went in. The whole time it hurt really bad and her arm hurt severely for 2 days from 25Mar2021. She still has pain in shoulder joint. That aside wasn&#39;t a big deal, it went away even though the joint is sore. The following Monday 29Mar2021 in the evening, her legs felt heavy and she had trouble going up the stairs. Then she had complete numbness of her left leg, from her hip or butt crack to the tip of her toes. It was on the same side she had the shot. It was further reported that the patient&#39;s legs felt heavy climbing stairs then she woke Thursday morning with her left leg numb. She couldn&#39;t feel herself starting to have a bowel movement because the numbness went all the way up to that area. She went to the ER (emergency room) on Saturday night (03Apr2021) because she was afraid of a blood clot. An ultrasound was done on her left leg, CT of head and neck, and blood work with nothing found. She has numbness and less range of movement in her left foot with trouble walking and have had no improvement with calf being numb. It was further clarified that when she was Easter shopping, there was numbness in her foot was causing her to drag her foot around the store. It was like someone who had a stroke, with slight impairment on one side. Her foot slaps the floor. She doesn&#39;t have control of it, she can&#39;t flex her foot up and down at all and she has little movement in her toes, even now. When she went to the emergency room, she thought she had a blood clot. She is a kidney donor and is healthy over all except for anemia that gives her tingly toes since she was 30, off and on. She never had a body part felt so numb, other than when she sits on her leg wrong. They did a bunch of tests there. They did a doppler, CT scan, and an EKG (unspecified date) which was abnormal. Her EKG has never been abnormal before. It said possible septal infarct undetermined time. The doppler showed no deep or superficial blockages noted from her groin down to her toes/ankle. The doppler was to check for blood clots. They referred her to her primary care provider who said that she will do a neurological exam. She has weakness in her left arm as well. The weakness in her left arm was only told by the neuro touch test. The patient further clarified that she doesn&#39;t have less range of motion, it is really just pain (arm). She can still move her arm all the way. Her left side is weaker or less sensitive as far as the neuro test. She wasn&#39;t aware she had less feeling on her arm until the nurse said she did. Her arm pain is nothing significant, it can hurt when moving her arm. She had no leg pain or anything like that until later in the week. She still had symptoms of losing her balance. Getting in and out of the chair she almost fell down. She didn&#39;t realize the numbness. Monday, she felt heaviness going up the stairs. For 2 days she had the worst pain ever in her arm. She had the tetanus shot and didn&#39;t have anything like that. It went away, when she raises her arm off from the side, she still has pain in the joint. She has migraines, it is nothing that is causing difficulty. She is more concerned something else happened. Patient thought maybe it is MS (multiple sclerosis) and asked if it is peripheral artery disease. She did smoke half a pack every other day. She is 49 but didn&#39;t start smoking till she was 36. It is a terrible habit and her doctor is aware. She also had her good and bad cholesterol which was just over 100. She is just reporting it because it happened on only the left side and she is a healthy person. She never had high blood pressure and never been treated for it, but she has had high heart rate before. It is not something that has ever caused any issue. She doesn&#39;t have something like peripheral artery disease, when she (software company name withheld) that is said plaque in the arteries. The doppler showed no signs of blockage superficial or deep on that side. She doesn&#39;t have an appointment until 29Apr2021. She doesn&#39;t know what to do to get more urgent care. The pain in her arm was better after the first 2 days. It is like a tooth ache, a dull ache. It is not all the time, just when moving her arm. Her legs were worse to where Thursday, she woke, and she was numb from the top of her leg to the tip of her toe. She can still lift her leg, but when she walks the tip of her second toe which is longer will drag on the ground. When she walks it is hard to hold her shoe on the left foot or put her shoe on. She can&#39;t maneuver her foot. When her foot hits the ground, the ball area of her foot smacks the floor because she doesn&#39;t have control over it. It is laboring to walk and is hard. She was kind of limping and pulling that leg on the left side. Her laboratory tests were BMP, CBC auto diff, CBC with diff, CT, angiogram of the head and neck, EKG 12 lead, and they did a venous doppler of the left lower extremity. It all came back good except the EKG which says septal infarct undetermined date, which has never come up on any tests before. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, Disability or permanent damage. There was no treatment received for the adverse event. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.

The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment of epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, observation was received for the events.    Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis and throat swelling cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

A 50-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number FR8732, on 05Apr2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot in lung from 26Mar2021 (according to the chest X-ray she did not still have it but she had not been to her pulmonologist yet), complete hysterectomy in Jan2021, liver condition, high cholesterol and blood clot. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) for blood clot, ursodiol for liver condition, and pravastatin for high cholesterol. The patient had the first dose on 05Apr2021. She began feeling muscle pain and a burning sensation in her shoulder blade the Thursday after receiving the vaccine (08Apr2021) and into Friday (09Apr2021). She had muscle tightening and aching in her left shoulder on 08Apr2021. By Monday mid morning (12Apr2021) she had tingling all down her left arm, across her back, down her right arm and into both legs. She began having tingling in her arms and legs bilaterally since last Monday (12Apr2021), however it was more prominent in her left extremities rather than the right. She wanted to know if this was a side effect of vaccine. She got the shot in her left arm. She went to the hospital and they admitted her. She had tests in the ER. She had MRIs, CTs and a battery of blood tests. They could only tell her what it was not and not what it was. It was not cancer, stroke, heart attack, aneurysm or a brain tumor. She was released and did not know what caused it. Again from the above that on Thursday (08Apr2021) her left shoulder muscle started aching and on Monday a week later she experienced tingling. She thought she was having a heart attack and was hospitalized for 4 days. She asked the doctor if this was a side effect and she was told to call the place where the vaccine was administered. She called the nurse and she could not give answers and recommended that she call Pfizer.  Several conditions were ruled out but she was not given a reason for her symptoms. Her HCP has not been helpful. She stated she had a complete hysterectomy in January but doesn&#39;t think that would have any effect. She had a CT on 12Apr2021, a MRI of her head and neck on 12Apr2021, a MRI with contrast on 14Apr2021 of her upper neck, a MRI of her lower back on 15Apr2021 and a bone scan on 15Apr2021. Stated that they all came back normal no abnormalities. The outcome of muscle tightening was resolving. The outcome of heart attack was unknown. The outcome of other events was not resolved.

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).  The patient previously took erythromycin, morphine and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis, throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache on 06Jan2021 11:15. Seriousness criteria reported as life threatening. Taken to ER had IV benadryl, solumedrol, pepcid for anaphylaxis. Placed on O2 and given albuterol nebulizer. Had IV fluid bolus. Now on benadryl and 5 days of prednisone. The patient felt completely fine prior to vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

While I have had other cardiac dysrhythmias throughout my adult life, this is the first time I have had diagnosed Afib. I took one dose of my PRN Propranalol (10mg) orally after a few minutes of the abnormal rhythm. When it didn&#39;t convert, I did go to the Emergency Department. My heart converted to normal sinus rhythm while on the monitor but before any other interventions were needed. I have a follow up appointment with my cardiologist tomorrow to determine further care as needed.

I called my PCP who ordered an EKG, CXR, COVID swab, a metabolic panel,  a CBC, and a D-dimer. My D-dimer was elevated and he called me to go directly to the emergency department, which I did and had a CTA chest. I was diagnosed with multifocal pulmonary emboli in my right lung with a slight pleural effusion on my left lung. I had a duplex ultrasound of my legs which was negatve for DVT, and an echocardiogram which was within normal limits. I was finally diagnosed with acute unprovoked pulmonary embolism, given a Heparin bolus and started on a Heparin IV infusion. Ultimately, I transitioned to Eliquis PO and was discharged from the hospital within 24 hours.

A 51-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right in Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hyperlipidemia, acute pancreatitis, May-Thurner syndrome, and allergies: penicillin, IV contrast. Concomitant medications included drospirenone, ethinylestradiol betadex clathrate (YAZ), fenofibrate, and levothyroxine. Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Patient was seen at the ED for right arm swelling in the setting of receiving her Pfizer COVID vaccine in the right arm 1 week prior. She was found to have a DVT (deep vein thrombosis) in right medial subclavian and superficial thrombosis in right proximal basilic vein. The events started on 17Mar2021 09:00. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Patient was recovering from the events. Treatment for AEs include anticoagulation.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of subject vaccine cannot be excluded for the DVT and other reported events, based on temporal relationship.  However the reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient. There is very limited information provided in this report.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Unknown cause of death; Cataract; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 51-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in Oct2020 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus-diagnosed 10-15 years ago, ongoing asthma-all her life, Allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes), and obesity. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a cataract surgery a couple of weeks prior on an unspecified date and on 21Apr2021, died of unknown cause. The reporter&#39;s mother was part of one of the clinical trial groups for the Pfizer COVID vaccine, and she died suddenly and unexpectedly last week. They did blood work with her family physician last week. It was fine. They didn&#39;t believe it was something she had going on. There were no indicators for why she died. She had lost a lot of weight, but she was trying to lose weight - she had been trying the past 3-4 years. Her blood work at the doctor before she died was the best her blood work had been in years. She had a physical, the week previous with our family doctors and the doctor had no reason to suspect that anything was about to happen. Medical examiner basis, they say because there is no drug overdose, they declined to do autopsy, but she has been part of trial and just dying suddenly unexpectedly. The family doctor doesn&#39;t know what to put on the death certificate. There were no drugs and no foul play involved so they won&#39;t do an autopsy. She was in the Pfizer clinical trial group. The doctor&#39;s office is supposed to report through CDC. His father reached out yesterday to the clinic group, but they haven&#39;t heard anything back. He is unsure of the exact dates she was given the vaccine. He thinks the first one was Sep2020, and the last one was Oct2020. Later on, she did receive paperwork that she did receive the vaccine, and not the placebo. It told her she got the vaccine and didn&#39;t need to be revaccinated. He is wondering if Pfizer will do an autopsy to see why she passed. His mom wanted to be cremated so once that happens, there won&#39;t be much information at that point. They are trying to hold off to see if Pfizer wants to do an autopsy. The doctor has no clue what happened. The doctor doesn&#39;t know what to put on the death certificate. At 2:45, 2:50, and 3:06 her fit bit just stopped. She has been at the funeral home since Wednesday. He is sure the funeral home would like to get started with something. They can&#39;t move forward with cremation until they know for sure. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of cataract. The outcome of the event cataract was unknown. The patient died on 21Apr2021. Autopsy was not performed.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Unknown cause of death

                                                Heart attack / she had a MI / diagnosed as a NSTEMI; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). This 52-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in left arm, on 07Jan2021, for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis) from 1998 and vitiligo from 1988. She was overweight. She had really no other risk factors. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 08Jan2021 the patient experienced heart attack and she had a MI, then a cardiac catherization that was normal and a normal echo as well. She said it was diagnosed as a NSTEMI and not a large MI, the smaller version. These events required hospitalization from 08Jan2021 to 12Jan2021. MI occurred after she finished clinic and she was not standing or doing anything, just sitting and she had chest pain. Her office was right next to the ER, so she received treatment within an hour and they were able to help her. She said that her hospital couldn&#39;t do a cardiac cath, so on 11Jan2021 they moved her to an hospital which was another treatment facility. When she had her MI they gave her acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and sublingual nitroglycerin. They tested her troponin and did an EKG which was abnormal on an unspecified date in Jan2021. On 08Jan2021 troponin was increased. When they treated her with nitroglycerin and Aspirin, two hours later her EKG was normal and her troponin came down overnight on 09Jan2021, which was when they said for sure that she had a heart attack. The patient said it was very scary to have a heart attack, but thankfully there was not a lot of damage done and she was able to get treatment quickly. She did not think the event was disabling since they did not see much damage to her heart muscle, it was a near miss kind of thing. She said it was life changing in that she will now be on medication forever, she will be on at least a baby Aspirin and probably something like a statin for the rest of her life. She was recovering, it was unknown what the lasting effects may be, she felt normal but tired from her hospital stay. Heart attack resolved on 08Jan2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event acute myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. The contributory role of the patient age and background of obesity cannot be excluded as well.

She stated that her arm was still swollen, when she got shot she was fine, her arm was sore that evening (Dec2020) and then nothing, then a weekend after new years her arm and shoulder became swollen (Jan2021) and she had been to the ER and the doctor thought the swelling was because of the shot, but she also had something else going on in her shoulder (Jan2021). So in the meantime she went to the ER and they took X rays, and they told her that she was starting to develop pneumonia. She was going back to work tomorrow, being that she was on the antibiotics now, still had swelling in the arm, and had pneumonia, should she still get the 2nd shot. She noticed the swelling Saturday after New Years. She was also achy all over in her neck, arm, and shoulder (Jan2021). She felt sick to her stomach, this was all the first Week of Jan2021. She went to the ER, she was not admitted and came home the same day. She went to the ER on 08Jan2021. 08Jan2021 was also when the pneumonia was diagnosed. The name of antibiotic she was prescribed was doxycycline. She started it on Saturday 09Jan2021, she was prescribed 100 mg 2 pills a day for 10 days. When they did the X ray, they said that the pneumonia had showed up, or she was just starting to get pneumonia.

She was schedule for the second dose today. She did reschedule for Friday, and wanted to know if she should still get it. In the ER, they said it could have been a blood clot and so they did a scan to find blood clots but it was negative.

Sometimes required BP support while on Dialysis and BP was 113/61 in ER. Pressure dropped to 100/70 and required mitrodrine after fluid was removed. The patient needed 4 liters supplemental O2 vs. only needing 2 liters at home. The patient experienced tachypnea and hypoxemia and no Respiratory failure. Respiration was 22. After 5 litres of O2 improved. Pulse 93 in ER. Cardiovascular: There was no heart failure, cardiogenic shock, Acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia and myocarditis. The patient Had chest pain which resolved when O2 was administered. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic: There was no Vomiting, Diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea but no vomiting or diarrhea and complained of abdominal pain. There was no Jaundice and acute liver failure. Neurological: There was no altered consciousness, altered consciousness, encephalopathy, meningitis and cerebrovascular accident. The patient had headaches a couple days before admitting to ER. Hematological: There was no Thrombocytopenia, Disseminated intravascular coagulation. INR was 3 due to large dose of coumadin, and platelets were 180 and white count 6.8. Slight troponin increased at 0.37 at admittance, BNP 39. The patient started coughing up blood, having hemoxysis and bleeding on unspecified date. Laboratory test or diagnostic studies was reported that test for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, or other commercial or public health assay. Xray showed vascular congestion with superimposed infiltrate which could represent pneumonia. Blood count was 11 and 36.7% at ER. Clinical chemistry: Sodium was 133; BUN was 68; Creatinine was 10. Evidence of hypoxemia: Pulse oO2 was 90 in ER.  CT scans: unknown results. Urinalysis: On dialysis so does not make urine. The patient had received Remdesivir, from 06Apr2021, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, Azithromycin from 06Apr2021 and Corticosteroids from 06Apr2021 for COVID-19.

An autopsy was not performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of the suspect drug cannot be excluded for the events vaccination failure, COVID-19, COVID-19 pneumonia, and sepsis. However, the patient&#39;s multiple medical comborbidities including renal failure requiring dialysis, lupus, and morbid obesity along with the risk of COVID-19 infection in light of the current pandemic are the more likely explanations for the development of these infections. The events gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemorrhage, hemolysis and troponin increased are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions, and are considered unrelated to the suspect drug. The patient is currently on warfarin which may increase the risk for bleeds. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: GI bleed

Medical history included hypothyroidism and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) 88mg and lisdexamfetamine mesylate (VYVANSE) 40mg both taken from unknown dates and unknown indication. The patient previously took clarithromycin (MACROBID) and experienced allergies. Historical vaccine included first dose BNT162B2 (brand: Pfizer) received on 24Feb2021 6:00pm (lot number: EN6202) at the age of 52-years-old in the left arm. It was reported that on Thursday, 08Apr2021 at approximately 7:00pm, the patient was standing in her kitchen when all of a sudden, a rush of numbness came over her whole left arm. The patient&#39;s arm was numb, heavy, and weak. She knew that this feeling was not normal, so she had her husband take her to the hospital, their local hospital. They arrived at approximately 7:30pm where the patient was took in right away. At that time, the feeling had returned to the patient&#39;s arm. The patient was taken back for a CAT scan on her head after which the doctor came to tell her that they would be keeping her overnight for observation since they think she had TIA (transient ischaemic attack). The patient was monitored overnight and at 6am the next day on 09Apr2021, she had an ultrasound on her carotid artery and later in the morning, at around 10am, the patient had an echo cardiogram. The patient was released at approximately 12pm on Friday, 09Apr2021. The events experienced resulted in &#34;Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and Hospitalization from 08Apr2021 to 09Apr2021&#34;. The patient has no COVID prior vaccination and had not tested for COVID post vaccination. Outcome of all the events was recovering.

A 52-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8737), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 02Apr2021 at 10:45 (at the age of 52-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included retinoblastoma, menorrhagia and fibroids from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included ethinylestradiol, norgestrel (OGESTREL-28) taken for menorrhagia, uterine leiomyoma; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop dates for both were not reported. On 03Apr2021, the patient woke up with slight pain in right calf. On 04Apr2021, she woke up with severe pain in right calf (unable to weight bear), then went to Urgent Care and was diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 7cm. Started apixaban (ELIQUIS) for 3 months, stopped low norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event. The outcome of the event was recovering.

A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 05Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0151) as single dose, for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing sjogren&#39;s syndrome and ongoing lupus. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  07Apr2021, she started having a nose bleed. She explains she wasn&#39;t doing anything in particular, just talking on the phone, and blood just started pouring out of her nose. Blood clots started coming out as well. She ended up calling 911 and they sent an ambulance. The EMS helped her stop the bleeding. She didn&#39;t go to the ER or anything. However, she is getting implants done for her upper teeth so she wanted to double check and make sure nothing was pressing against her nasal cavity because the nose bleeds were so off/random. The doctor said there was no pushing. The doctor completed a panoramic exam/x-ray and confirmed there was nothing pushing. The doctor did suggest she go to the ENT. She made an appointment with an ENT doctor for the following day, 08Apr2021, and the ENT put a camera down. She confirms she explained to them she just had the vaccine and she was googling information. She was told to not google anything and to let them check it out.  The caller states she explained to the ENT the reason she was there was because she was concerned, she is not a nose bleeder and nose bleeds never happened to her. Once blood clots started coming out that way, she was terrified. They didn&#39;t see anything alarming, but they wanted to make sure and do further research, so basically they planned to do a CT/CAT scan. She was scheduled for a CT/CAT scan on Monday, 12Apr2021, but she was allergic to the contrast and was sent home because they were not prepared for pre-medication. She is waiting for the doctor to schedule another appointment so she can go back. She felt she needed to report these nose bleeds because she has been seeing Johnson &amp; Johnson had severe blood clots, but she took Pfizer&#39;s vaccine, and was also getting blood clots. Her nose bleeds just happened right after both vaccines. On an unspecified date, she had a little bump that went away. She had this big bump on her arm and a big rash developed. At first, the bump was the size of a quarter and then grew double in size. The bump finally went down, but the rash she can still see. The rash hasn&#39;t grown, it&#39;s just there- there is just a red blotch on her arm. She has not had another nose bleed since the one that occurred on 07Apr2021. She just noticed when she had her first dose on 15Mar2021, the nose bleed happened within that week also. The outcome of events was unknown.

A 53-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction on an unspecified date, dizzy on 31Dec2020, arm was really sore on an unspecified date, tiredness on an unspecified date. Event details: She was dizzy that day especially with changing positions, she didn&#39;t need to go to the doctor or anything. It wasn&#39;t severe. She was just a little dizzy. It&#39;s probably just the vaccine and it did go away. Her arm was really sore and went away after a few days. the tiredness, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. She did feel better about. it wasn&#39;t a serious anaphylactic reaction. It didn&#39;t happen right away. She had arm soreness. it wasn&#39;t immediate. She usually didn&#39;t have. It was really weird. She thought she was well hydrated. The outcome of event was really sore was resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the anaphylactic reaction and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is very limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 06Jan2021 (at the age of 53-years-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient experienced electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormal and large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm on 08Jan2021; numbness and tingling in right thumb on 10Jan2021; reddened area with bruising with nodule on 26Jan2021; chest discomfort and heart attack in Jan2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: Two days later after vaccination, she noticed bruising on various parts of body. The first bruise she noticed on the 08Jan2021. It was probably about 3.5 inches in length 2 inches in width. The patient stated that it did not necessarily have a shape. She had a large bruise on her right buttock. Two days later, she noticed a similar in size bruise on the front of her right thigh. Then a couple days later, she noticed three quarter size bruises on her right arm (two on the inner part of arm, and one on the outer, both on upper arm). The very next day, she developed the same sizing bruise. It was about the same size on her left upper arm. There were no other side effects besides the bruising. There was no itching or redness, no skin, respiratory, or neurological issues. The day before her second dose, on 26Jan2021, she noticed a 4 inch reddened area with a two centimeter nodule inside that bruise. The patient stated that the initial bruises began to heal. They are not as dark as they were. They were reported to have started out red and then turned black and blue. The patient also had numbness and tingling in her right thumb. She was having some chest discomfort after the initial vaccination that is still ongoing. The chest discomfort prompted her to go to urgent care on 08Jan2021, where she had an abnormal EKG on 08Jan2021. The patient was told to follow up with a cardiologist. The patient saw the cardiologist on 25Jan2021, where he did an EKG and ECHO. The EKG was abnormal and ECHO with unknown results on 25Jan2021, but the doctor was unable to determine when the heart attack occurred. The cardiologist also ran labs: a troponin to see if anything was acutely going on, and a D Dimer to evaluate her clotting factors; both were negative on 25Jan2021. The cardiologist recommended a computerised tomogram (CT) scan, which was still scheduled at the time of report. The clinical outcome of large bruise on right buttock/right thigh/right arm, chest discomfort, numbness and tingling in right thumb, and reddened area with bruising with nodule was not recovered and of heart attack and EKG abnormal was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                I received the first covid vaccine on 1/4/21 and the 2nd on 1/25/21.  On Feb 22nd I started having heavy vaginal bleeding and severe stomach cramps.  These continued for 9 days and then I went to the Emergency department because I felt like my HGB was low.  They checked it and it was 11.3 and did an abd US that showed my endometrium was thick.  They recommended follow up with GYN and a biopsy.  I continued to have significant bleeding and cramps until the next week when I called the nurse line and they set me up with a virtual visit with GYN provider.  She started me on progesterone and scheduled a hysteroscopy and D &amp; C for the following week.  The progesterone slowed the bleeding down but I continued to experience abd cramps.  I had the D &amp; C and after getting home started to have heavy bleeding and bad cramps again.  The following week I called the GYN provider and she had me come in for another Abd US and checked my HGB which was 9.3.  She also checked for infection and other labs which were all within nml range.  The pathology from my D &amp; C was neg and the GYN really was not worried that is was anything other than a period but was surprised that it was lasting so long.  She gave me TXA and after 5 days on that the bleeding has now stopped but I am still having bad cramps in my lower abd and a lot of bloating.  Also having lots of jolting pains in lower abd.  I have never had  periods that were anything like this and never really had bad cramps like this before.

Her second dose is scheduled on 13Apr2021, she would like to know if there are recommendations for her second dose because she heard that with the second dose the side effects are worse, she would like to know if someone else has reported these symptoms. She would like to know if she should possibly receive the vaccine in her thigh instead of her arm and if that would be helpful.

A 53-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6200), administered in left arm on 24Feb2021 (at the age of 53-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccination facility type was reported as other. The patient was not pregnant. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. No known allergies were reported. The patient had not had COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. It was reported that on 13Mar2021 08:15 exactly 17 days after reporter&#39;s mother received her first Pfizer vaccine she had a cardiac arrest, luckily reporter was with her when this happened and he/she called immediately and followed the steps of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) etc. When the emergency team arrived she had no pulse and they used the defibrillator on her 4 times. The entire day they did not know if she would survive. She was sedated and tested, they got the news that she had survived and there was not brain damage. The doctors had no clue what the cardiac arrest was caused by, she had no prior health conditions and the tests show nothing to what could have caused this event (no blood clots, no clogged arteries etc.). The only thing that changed leading up to the event was her receiving her first vaccine. Luckily reporter was there when this happened or else she would in fact be dead. She now had a defibrillator implanted and reporter had a post-traumatic stress from the traumatic event and witnessing his/her mom on the ground turning purple and lifeless. They need answers. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The events were reported as serious since resulted in hospitalization and life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatments were received for the events and they were reported as multiple lifesaving treatments, tests, and defibrillator implant. The patient underwent lab tests and procedure which included COVID test (negative) on unspecified date post vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved for the event &#34;she had no pulse&#34; and resolved with sequel (reported as recovered with lasting effects) for all other events.

A 53-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07Apr2021 at 14:00 (Batch/Lot number was not unknown; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), at age of 53 year-old, as 0.3 mL single, for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver disease from 2016 and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose on 17Mar2021 for Covid-19 immunization and experienced fever. The patient received her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 07Apr2021 and reports having side effects after. She is specifically worried about the leg pain that she is experiencing and would like to know if it is possible that it could be related to a blood clot and if she needs to be worried about it. She stated that with the &#34;swollen joints&#34; and everything from the vaccine, it is possible that it worsened her back condition and may have &#34;pinched a nerve or something.&#34; She describes it as the worst pain she&#39;s ever felt in her life and states it &#34;comes out of the blue&#34; so she does not have time to prepare for it. She likens it to a &#34;Charley horse&#34; but a &#34;really bad one&#34; that goes away and has no pain afterwards. She states she is scheduled for an MRI next week of her lower back to investigate. The patient also mentions that she thinks she had COVID-19 at the time of her vaccine because &#34;when I got the shot, I had a super strong response.&#34; On 07Apr2021, the patient had body aches, chills, she was on the couch for quite a while. The joint pain was incredible, even in her toes. She felt like she had a horrible flu. Her every muscles and every joint hurt, and her head hurt. She was on the couch for like 4 days. On day 3 or 4 she developed intermittent pain in the leg and shin on 08Apr2021. It feels like someone is drilling a jackhammer in it. It feels like a Charley&#39;s horse, but not, more like it&#39;s in the bone. She didn&#39;t associate it with the vaccine at first, even though she had never had this pain before until she got the vaccine. She said that she has had some back problems and scheduled a MRI to see if she had pinched nerve or something. On 08Apr2021, she also has some tingling on the skin. She read about side effects of blood clots and doesn&#39;t know if this leg pain could be related to a blood clot. She assumed it could be from her back. She read that with blood clots there is usually an ache and discoloration, which she does not have now. She also read that intermittent Charley&#39;s horse could have something to do with blood clots. She has pins and needles on the skin. She also had a headache after the vaccine, but she does not have it now. She said that the pain in her leg that shoots on and bangs in her tibia hurts when bending over, lifting her leg to her chest, squatting to pick up something, and going up and down the stairs. She said that the pain is horrible and it is worse than leg pain, it is worse than a charley horse, it is the worst pain she has ever felt in her life. She cannot stop screaming when it happens. States with the joint pain that she had, there may be a nerve that&#39;s being pressed on her back. She said that with all of the information being reported in the news about blood clots, she asked is that something she needs to be concerned about. She said that she did a virtual visit with her doctor and notified her of the leg pain and asked the doctor to schedule her for an MRI because of the pain. She stated her hemoglobin and hematocrit, MCV are high.  She also said that the clotting is affecting her red blood cells. She ran a fever with the first vaccine, but she had a high fever between 103-104 degrees Fahrenheit after the second vaccine that stopped on 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021. Her high fever lasted for about 3 days. She had a low grade fever that lasted for about a week. Her body aches resolved completely on 12Apr2021 or 13Apr2021. Her joint pain is in her back and elbows. She also had lot of joint pain in her shoulder and arm and radiates to her neck on the left side. She still has some muscle pain in her leg, but overall her muscle pain is gone. For treatment she used Ibuprofen 600 mg by mouth and fluids. The day before her shot, her son called and told her he tested positive for covid. She got a PCR test immediately on 07Apr2021 and the next day she was told it was negative. She thinks she might have tested too soon. She also says her response to it was so strong, she must have been getting covid and didn&#39;t know it. She might have tested negative because she had the first shot already. She wasn&#39;t worried about exposing others and went to get her second shot, but she got really sick after that and it kicked her butt pretty hard. The outcome of the events for leg pain and tingling on skin was not recovered, fever, body aches and headache recovered in Apr2021, chills on 11Apr2021, muscle hurt/pain on 12Apr2011, joint pain was recovering, and outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                10days after receiving vaccine developed an anaphylactic allergy after eating shellfish which I was never allergic to. I developed a red itchy rash over the entire body with throat tightening. Went to ER where I was treated with H1 H2 blockers steroids. After being treated and observed for a few hours I re developed the rash and symptoms again requiring further treatment and observation.

About 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine, my throat felt strange, my sinuses started getting congested, my ears started plugging.  I felt dizzy when walking.  I spent extra time at the clinic under observation.  About 40 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I suddenly felt like I was being sucked into a vacuum and thought I was going to pass out.  I alerted the nurses, who checked my vital signs and put me on O2.  My heart rate was normal, my BP was high, my O2 sat was 100%.  After about 5 minutes I started to feel normal, they removed the O2.  They continued to observe me for another 15 minutes, until I felt better.  As I drove home (about 1 hour 10 min after receiving the vaccine), my face and lips became numb.  I continued driving home and the numbness resolved in about 10-15 minutes.  I notified my doctor of the event and she advised me not to get the second dose and to report the event.

My husband was making breakfast.  I came downstairs, ate, had a cup of coffee, then got a glass of water and an ice pack and sat on a recliner in the living room.  I don&#39;t remember much of the rest.  It was like a dream.  My husband said I let out a yell, my arms flailed and my eyes were very strange.  I lost muscle strength in my lift side mimicking a stroke.  He called 911.  I was taken to Emergency facility where I gained consciousness.  I was then transferred to Hospital.  So far every test has come back negative.  I have an EEG scheduled for this Thursday.

                                                increased AFib episodes; joint ache esp to left knee with pain; Headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 54-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration at arm left on 28Jan2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 54-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib), depression, aortic stenosis and allergy to sulfa, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included losartan, HCTZ, sertraline hydrochloride (ZOLOFT), vitamin D3, magnesium and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12).  The patient previously took LEVOQUIN and prednisone and experienced allergies. On 02Feb2021 at 08:00, the patient experienced increased AFib episodes, joint ache esp. to left knee with pain and headache.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 (nasal swab) test: negative on 22Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included acupuncture and the events required physician office visit. The patient outcome of the event was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event atrial fibrillation is related to BNT162B2.  The event only occurred 4 days after vaccination.  And the patient had underlying atrial fibrillation, which is considered the most likely cause of the reported event.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                After the first vaccine on 2/6/2021,  I did not have any reaction except a sore arm until 2/10/2021 when developed a bad headache causing me to leave work.  When I awoke on 2/11/21 I felt worse as the day went on until I had complete flu like symptoms.  On Friday, 2/12, I went to my primary care doctor and they did a COVID-19 test which was negative.  Hence, I just waited for the reaction to go away,  I was not better and able to resume normal activity until 2/15/21.  I did decide to get the second shot as I was not entirely sure it was a result of the vaccine. On 2/27/2021, I received the second vaccination.  Again, the immediate side effect was only a sore arm. On the following Monday (3/1/2021) see cont.I began to have what I thought was muscle aches and pains around the mid section on my body but they were manageable.  On Tuesday and Wednesday (3/3/2021) the pain and area of the pain spread and intensified.  I was unable to sleep or find a comfortable position and was losing strength and knew I needed medical attention as I was afraid it was a heart issue.  My husband took me to the ER (3/4/2021).  The ER doctor ran a CT scan with contrast and the result was a blood clot in my right lung and pneumonia in my left lung along with pleurisy. I was then admitted to Clinic on 3/4/2021.  I remained in the hospital until 3/7/2021.  There I was treated with IV antibiotics, warfarin, Lovenox (80mg), and pain medication for the pleurisy. I was also on a full time heart monitor and my heart was checked several times. Since returning home, I finished a dose of two antibiotics and am using an inhaler to help with breathing.  I have also just finished a long dose of steriods.  My INR is still not regulated to the therapeutic level.  Prior to this reaction, I was in the therapeutic range and had been checked.  As of 4/3/2021 I am at 1.8 not in the 2-3 range and have increased my dose from before the reaction at 7.5 mg to 9.0 mg daily.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her husband. This is the first of two reports.  A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 54 years of age), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm right on 10Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included severe asthma which started as a child and then it went away and then as an adult it got severe around 2010 and ongoing, she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She had ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), brain surgery in 2007, low immune system, allergies to cephalosporins, pulmonary and stomach issues; and bradycardia (as her BP usually runs 90/45 and she is bradycardic). Concomitant medications included tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA RESPIMAT), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR HFA), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR HFA), salbutamol (VENTOLIN [SALBUTAMOL]), and montelukast (MONTELUKAST), all taken for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; clarithromycin (CLARITIN [CLARITHROMYCIN], omeprazole, phenytoin sodium, azelastine, ipratropium bromide, fluticasone propionate (FLONASE [FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE]), and ipratropium bromide, salbutamol sulfate (DUONEB), all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; prednisone taken for an unspecified indication from 2021 and ongoing as she was on this steroid 2 weeks before the vaccine; and  azithromycin which she takes prophylactically for her low immune system from an unspecified start date and ongoing. She was on a lot of medications period and most are for her pulmonary and stomach issues. The patient previously took propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, and Percocet wherein the patient had drug hypersensitivity and anaphylactic shock with these; adhesive from nicotine patch made her arm to get red and swollen (Dermatitis contact). She previously took EpiPen for anaphylaxis. It was reported that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She got her vaccine at a hospital in their clinic and she was transferred from the vaccine clinic to the ER. Stated she was given a shot with an Epi-pen in her thigh at the clinic and transferred to the ER. In the ER, she was given Benadryl and watched for 4 hours. She would state this was medically significant because of airway, breathing, circulation and she felt like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She added that it was kind of weird and freaky. She mentioned that along with that, shortly before she was released from the ER, she experienced a very sore arm where she was given the injection. She heard that was very common so she dealt with it. However as the night progressed, it got increasingly worse, it almost felt like she was punched several times in her arm. It probably started between hour 3 and 4 after receiving the vaccine. She added that she had a very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.  It was not serious, just annoying and it was gone 3 days later. She had injection site bruising on 10Mar2021. She stated that she knows this because she was a nurse, but a lot of times, people experienced this reaction when they are given Dilaudid wherein they  get a warm feeling in their chest, so they push it really slow and dilute it with saline so it doesn&#39;t have the respiratory factor. She stated that this was kind of what the feeling was like for her and it was scary because she didn&#39;t expect it. She stated that the ER team that assessed her said, because she wasn&#39;t used to that feeling, she may have had a panic attack and that may have made it worse. After she was treated, she spoke with her husband and he had the shot two minutes before her and he had the same feeling but he didn&#39;t freak out and didn&#39;t want to appear weak. Stated he told her he had the same feeling and it lasted 5 minutes and then it went away. Stated since she got scared, it made it worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she had a panic attack that made it worse. She stated that of course her husband didn&#39;t tell her that until she was out of the ER, that it does go away. That made her feel better because she wasn&#39;t the only one that experienced that. States he didn&#39;t say anything about it, because he was worried about her,  he said it was a warm feeling in the chest and not being able to breathe but he didn&#39;t want to say anything because she was an asthmatic and would panic and start feeling worse. She mentioned that they weren&#39;t going to let her get the second dose, so she went to an allergy doctor and told them what happened and about her husband having the same reaction and because she was severely immunocompromised. Stated the hospital said they were not giving her the second dose unless an allergist says it is safe and sets a protocol and he had to write a letter to the hospital. Stated she was pre-medicated 24 hours before the vaccine with 50mg Benadryl, 50mg Benadryl the day of the shot and 50mg of Benadryl two days after the shot. Stated she will have full immunity on 14Apr2021. She added that she had a pulmonary doctor, brain cancer doctor, ENT doctor, stated they don&#39;t know if it was caused by the vaccine, but they are pretty sure she had a reaction but they can handle it with pre-medicating her. She received the second vaccine on 31Mar2021. She mentioned that she was happy to be able to get her second shot. She stated that at first they didn&#39;t want to give it to her because of her reaction but she kept calling. So she went to a hospital to saw an allergist and he had to sign off that it was safe to give her the second shot and under what circumstances. Stated she had the letter from the hospital that she was seen by them and she needed to be pre-medicated and it had to be given at a hospital that had the ability to intervene quickly and she needed to be watched for at least 30 minutes after the vaccine. She mentioned that to go through what she went though, and not be able to get would have been disappointing. Because of her immune system, it is important to get the shot and there was a way around the reaction which worked for her. She added that even having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, she was able to recover quickly. Stated with having asthma, COPD and a low immune system, she may not recover from Covid. It makes sense they evaluated it and came up with a solution and a pre medication protocol and when and how long and she was still able to get the shot because it is important. Answers to follow up questions indicated that on 10Mar2021, the patient had the first dose of the vaccine and it felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was given the shot and getting ready to get out of the chair and her husband was about to sit down for his shot. Stated she would say the time of the course of the reaction was within under 5 minutes of her injection. The patient required medical intervention with Epi-Pen, Benadryl, and Duo-Neb. The patient was not hospitalized because she was immunocompromised, it was better to watch herself at home and because she had an Epi Pen at home in case she has that sort of reaction returning over a 72 hour period. Stated they instructed her husband and told them if she felt any different to come back to ER. She was not admitted to the ICU. Organ involvement included: Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress. The event required initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure including Epi-Pen, Benadryl, DuoNeb. Patient have a history of previous allergies: Medication Allergies to Cephalosporins, Anesthesia medications: Propofol, Versed, Nitrous Oxide, Percocet: Anaphylactic shock; Adhesive from nicotine patch, caused her arm to get red and swollen. She takes EpiPen as she had previous history of allergies and since she had multiple medication allergies and had a history of quickly going into anaphylaxis, stated her BP usually runs 90/45 and she was Bradycardic. She did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the events being reported. She did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. She has not received any other vaccines around the time of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The patient recovered from &#39;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#39;, Difficulty breathing, and &#39;warm feeling in the chest&#39; on 10Mar2021; while having an anaphylactic reaction from the vaccine, Respiratory, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing and Respiratory Distress were recovered on an unknown date; Vaccination site pain recovered on 13Mar2021 and Injection site bruising recovered on 18Mar2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all events except Vaccination site pain and Injection site bruising. Relatedness of drug to reactions/events: Reaction assessed for events &#34;felt funny in her chest, like a really weird, really warm and heavy feeling, almost like she couldn&#39;t breathe&#34;, &#39;very sore right arm where she was given the injection; felt like she was punched several times in her arm.&#39; and Injection site bruising: Method of assessment: Global Introspection: Drug result: Related.

                                                After receiving the first dose on 4/1/21 Lot# ER8733, I had light spotting for 2 days.  Second dose given 04/23/21 and by 04/28/2021 I started bleeding again And by the second day I was soaking through pads and huge clots were coming out. This has never happened to me before.  After 7 days of bleeding heavily I woke up on May 5th at 4:00 a.m. with intense abdominal cramping The only way I can describe was labor. I felt back labor, pelvic pressure, frequent urination and intense pain. I reached out to my gynecologist And he immediately told me to remove my estrogen patch and later that morning he started me on progesterone treatment for 10 days to stop the bleeding. After 7 hours of pain on May 5th, I went to the emergency department and an ultrasound revealed a blood clot. From ultrasound results &#34;there is a complex area in the area of the cervix measuring 5.7 x 3.6 x 2.6 cm.&#34;   After several hours I was released from the emergency room taking toradol for pain. That evening I passed a huge blood clot!  I&#39;m very grateful it was where it was and I could expel it.  But there&#39;s no doubt the second vaccine caused this issue that has never happened to me before. I still get my periods though irregular and very light. So this event was highly unusual and very painful

I had already left the drive-thru vaccination clinic and was driving to the hospital emergency room where I work. I informed my colleagues of my symptoms and was treated for anaphylaxis with IV diphenhydramine and famotidine over several hours. I was given a prescription for a prednisone taper for the next 6 days.

After first injection and vaginal bleeding, gynecology exam completed for abnormalities; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 55-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), intramuscular in the left arm on 22Dec2020 at 16:00 at a single dose; and the second dose via intramuscular in the left arm on 08Jan2021 at 08:00 at a single dose as COVID-19 vaccine. Medical history included a known latex allergy and previous spontaneous cerebral artery dissection x 3 ( nonspecific connective tissue disease). The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination and did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. Concomitant medications (reported as other medications within two weeks of vaccination) included estrogens conjugated (PREMARIN), micronized progesterone, colecalciferol (Vitamin D), folic acid (FOLATE), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 23Dec2020, the patient experienced profuse watery vaginal bleeding 12 hours after the injection. The bleeding lasted approximately six hours. After the first injection and vaginal bleeding, a gynecology exam was completed for abnormalities. Previously diagnosed uterine fibroids present and some free fluid in the pelvis by ultrasound. Bleeding resolved by the end of post-vaccine day 1. After the second vaccine, heavy vaginal bleeding started 10 hours after a injection. It was reported that the adverse event result in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment for the event involved removal of the IUD. Outcome of the event was recovering. The case was reported as non-serious (did not result in death, was not life-threatening, did not cause/prolong hospitalization, was not disabling/incapacitating, and did not result to any congenital anomaly/birth defect).  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is reasonable possibility that the event vaginal hemorrhage is related to suspect drug BNT162B2 based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and the onset of events.

                                                The day after the vaccination I had redness around my whole shoulder and arm. On the third day I developed swelling of my shoulder and neck with horrible pain when I breathe.   I went to urgent care and had an x-ray which was clear and they were treating me for myalgia with Motrin. I refused any narcotic pain medication or a Toradol shot.  The pain never stopped on the 19th I went to Work Force Safety and reported it and I was examined by the nurse practitioner who saw all the swelling and the pain that I was in. That nurse practitioner told me if it wasn?t better in a few days to go to the emergency room to be examined.  On January 23 , I developed swelling and pain went underneath my armpit it?s a burning pain that?s constant since the third day after my injection. My blood pressure was 153/104 and I was having nausea and not feeling well at all. On January 25 the pain and swelling were still there I went to work for a few hours and I went to the emergency room. They gave me lidocaine patch and Zofran for the nausea my blood pressure was 159/103 and I had an ultrasound to rule out a blood clot there was no blood clot but there was lymphadenopathy under my arm hurt and swelling and inflammation around the shoulder. The chest x-ray showed left pleural effusion / Pneumonia. My oxygen saturation was 93 and they wanted to admit me but I am a single mom with a new diabetic 14-year-old at home so they let me go home with a pulse oximeter and a prescription for doxycycline For 10 days.  They called me the next day from the emergency room to follow up with a pulmonologist and cardiologist. On January 28 I saw the pulmonologist who did an ultrasound in his office and saw the fluid on my left lung. He said that most likely because the technique of the injection was so high in my shoulder that they probably had a nerve and I did have the swelling in the lymphadenopathy and all the pain and it hurt when I breathe so I wasn?t breathing correctly and I was splitting my arm against me and that?s how I probably developed plural effusion and pneumonia. I am following up with him on February 4. I still have shortness of breath and my oxygen saturation is 93. I am also on two inhalers that the pulmonologist ordered.

Ten days after I developed a slight pain in right lateral side that progresses to constant pain in 2 places on right side including under right clavicle. I had pain upon taking in a deep breath. Saw MD after 4 days of these SXS. Performed labs, Chest x-ray and EKG. All were essentially normal except elevated WBC count. Have 2 COVID test which were both normal. Md said possibly some sort of inflammation and suggested taking anti-inflammatories which did not help much at all with SXS. After a few more days the SXS changed to constant chest pain(pressure), SOB upon exertion and pain behind knee. F/U with MD again and it was decided to wait a few more days. Upon suggestion from friend asked MD to perform D-Dimer lab test. The result was 4,400. My normal value should have been 550. Sent to ER. CT of chest, EKG and more labs performed. CT revealed large bilateral pulmonary embolisms in pulmonary arteries. Started on blood thinners. Ultrasound of left leg revealed large DVT. Sent home after 2 days on blood thinners. SXS stopped after a few days.

                                                Anaphylaxis, confirmed by ER; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 55-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EN6200, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 at 12:15 PM as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported as the hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took codeine and hydrocodone bitartrate, paracetamol (VICODIN), from which she had known allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID post vaccination. On 19Feb2021 at 12:15 PM, the patient experienced anaphylaxis, confirmed by emergency room (ER). The adverse event (AE) resulted in a doctor or other HCP office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of anaphylaxis, confirmed by ER, which included epinephrine, steroids, and antihistamines. The patient recovered from the event on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile and temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the event anaphylactic reaction cannot be excluded.

A 55-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in arm left on 19Feb2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201), at the age of 55 years, as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed 3 years ago, ongoing gastrooesophageal reflux disease diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing hypertension diagnosed 4 years ago, ongoing food allergy: allergic to eggs, shellfish, dairy/lactose intolerant, ongoing allergies to environmental: standard- hay fever, dust, mold, ongoing allergies to dogs and cats, contrast media reaction (IV contrast CT scan dye- respiratory distress, throat tightens), urticaria, pruritus. She had Covid on 18Dec2020 and &#34;Covid rash it attached her muscular system. She had muscular pain in the wrist and hip on the right side and mild double vision.&#34; The patient previously took vitamin k 2 and experienced anaphylactic reaction, Toradol and experienced urticaria, influenza vaccine and experienced rash at the injection site, at the age of 34 years (because she&#39;s allergic to eggs). The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 on 29Jan2021 Lot: EL3247; 9:30 AM; Right arm for covid-19 immunisation and she did not have any symptoms whatsoever with the first shot. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. Vaccination Facility Type: Hospital. Concomitant medications included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease; lisinopril taken for hypertension; montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR) taken for asthma; salbutamol sulfate (INHALERIN) taken for asthma; start and stop date were not reported for all.  The patient experienced anaphylaxis on 26Feb2021 with outcome of unknown, throat starting to close/throat started tightening on 19Feb2021 with outcome of recovered, severe rash- latus stranding, purple dots, and hives from face all the way down to toes on 19Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, double vision on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right eye is going cross eyed/left eye is dropping on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, right wrist pain increased dramatically after the vaccine on 20Feb2021 with outcome of not recovered, hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown for Hand swelling and recovered for Localised itching. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events: Benadryl, Zyrtec, Pepcid, New glasses for double vision, Prednisone 7 day ween. The patient underwent lab tests which included Hematology test on unknown date with unknown results; Immune markers on 11Mar2021 with unknown results. Clinical course: The patient received the vaccine on 19Feb2021at 10:00 AM and five minutes after, her throat started tightening and they put her in observation for another hour and then her throat felt fine and they let her go. Caller confirmed she was not referring to this occurrence as anaphylaxis.  The anaphylactic reaction occurred days later. She mentioned from 19Feb2021-26Feb2021, her symptoms were progressing and then on 26Feb2021, it was full blown out; the actual anaphylaxis was 26Feb2021. Between this, she had severe double vision, severe rash from face all the way down to toes, one eye going cross eyed (right eye), left eye is still drooping. On 20Feb2021, she started having double vision that started with the sunlight and fluorescent lights and the next day she couldn&#39;t see anything without double vision, and her eye started going cross eyed. She still cannot see normally now. She is under eye doctor care for that too. The patient was treated with Epi-Pen into leg and then into the Emergency Room. She received 50 mgs of Benadryl and 125 mg of Solu-Medrol IM injection, but still have to give Epi because her throat was still closing. Her airway was intact and no nebulizer treatment needed. The patient reported also that her hands got very swollen and rash and itchy beyond itch. The patient reported that her weight at that point was 204, the she had been on Prednisone for a week, and her weight has gone up to 210 now. After her throat closed on the 26Feb2021, caller reports she gained 7 pounds while on it for one week. Caller stated she was also put on prednisone when she got diagnosed with asthma, reactive airway. She confirmed her throat stop closing immediately after the Epi. The patient was also treated with 25 mgs of Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Pepcid a day. Outcome for throat closing was improved with medication. Outcome for rash was not improved and she is taking medicine to counteract it; itch went away when she took the Zyrtec. Regarding right wrist pain, it increased dramatically after the vaccine. Caller reports it felt like a spiral fracture down the ulna and it started to ache on 20Feb2021, by the next day it hurt a 5 out of 10. By 22Feb2021, she was wearing a splint, it was 8 out of 10, and she felt like she fractured it and it was swollen on the ulnar side. Regarding eye disorder, she is now under the care of an eye doctor for her severe double vision, eye crossing, and eye drooping. The blurred eyes give bad balance and that kind of stuff. The cross eyedness gives her poor peripheral vision and also her depth perception has now been compromised. They say the glasses will fix it. As of 22Feb2021, a new pair of special lenses with prisms were ordered for her. The patient was not hospitalized.

A 55-year-old adult female received the first dose of BNT162b2 (solution for injection; Lot EN6202 and expiry information not provided) via unspecified route in the left arm on 03Mar2021 between 17:10 and 17:30 (at 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Frozen shoulder (2020-2020), and severe migraines (especially in the past ten years). The patient further stated that she has always had migraines. She said sometimes when her migraines escalate, her blood pressure goes up, and her left side tingles. She said several times in the past, she thought her migraine symptoms may have been a stroke. She said she her doctor is checking her for any kind of things like rheumatoid arthritis, mast cells, constant (chronic) fatigue, and fibromyalgia. She said right before the COVID-19 Virus pandemic she had passed out unexpectedly. She said she doesn&#39;t know what caused her to pass out. She said she needs another neurological test done. She said she had a neurological test that maybe showed that veins were dying in her brain, but she wasn&#39;t sure. She said her doctor had been doing heart tests too, but because of the pandemic, it was taking longer to have the tests done. The patient also mentioned that her last blood work was probably in/around Nov2020. There were no concomitant medications or past drug history reported. The patient denied receiving any other vaccination within the four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient also denied receiving any other vaccination on the same date as the vaccination. The patient reported that on 04Mar2021, approximately seventeen hours after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she had what she thought was a kind of severe reaction. She said she had an inside numbness and tingling all over her body. She said the left side of her body, especially, had a very strong numbness and tingling, like a stroke. She said the numbness was in her left hand, and outside left shoulder. She said the left half of her face was numb. She said at the time she felt weird. She said she was speaking to her friend on a video call and did not want her friend to think she was a cry baby. She said then her friend told her there was something happening with her face. She said the right side of her face had dropped. She said her right eye and the right side of her mouth were drooping. She said she told her friend she thought she had an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine.  She said it took about three hours for her symptoms to pass. She said afterward she was so tired, had pain, and a headache. She said it was strange for her to have a headache because she was used to migraines. She said she still had a headache today (08Mar2021). She said she had a heaviness with her headache. She said if she had a migraine, she would not be able to do anything, but with the headache she had, she was able to go about her everyday things. She said her stomach was bothering her too, but she was not worried about how her stomach felt. The events did not require any visits to a physician&#39;s office nor the emergency room. Treatment for the events included drinking a lot of water and moving around. The outcome of the events, inside numbness and tingling all over her body, very strong numbness and tingling, like a stroke¸ numbness was in her left hand, and outside left shoulder, half of her face was numb, right side of her face had dropped, and tongue looked swollen, and allergic reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine was recovered on 04Mar2021 after about three hours duration.

Then on Wednesday morning, March 31st (two weeks after receiving the first dose), she was found in bed by my mother, unable to walk or talk, her face was drooping, she was very sweaty, and had defecated on herself. My mother called the ambulance. She was transported to Hospital where it was determined she had suffered a massive hemorrhagic stroke. She was immediately transported by ambulance to another Hospital. She spent one day in ICU and then was put on palliative care. She died around 12/N on Friday, April 2nd, two days after the stroke.

                                                On April 9th, I developed a headache at 9pm while watching tv. About 15 minutes later I noticed my vision was changing so I called my daughter to come stay with me and took tylenol fast release capsules. I went to bed and woke up the next morning with the same headache so I asked my daughter to take me to urgent care. Upon arrival they did a Covid test. I told them about my previous stroke in July 2020 and that I had a PFO closure done in October and have been on Plavix (clopidogrel) since then so I wasn&#39;t worried about stroke. The dr sent me to the ER immediately and they performed an MRI scan and told me I had suffered a new stroke due to blood clot.

I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

                                                56 year old female presents with complaint of tingling and numbness that she noticed to her lower left jaw.  It occurred yesterday around 3 PM after she received her Covid vaccination.  She states that then started to move up to her left cheek but has now gone back down just to the lower left jaw.  It is in a specific region of that area.  She states also that she is having a fever today and generalized body aches that are moderate in nature.  She also notes some urinary frequency without dysuria or hematuria.  Patient took Tylenol this morning around 6 AM.  She initially tried to swallow the pill and felt like she was going to choke on it and spit the pill up.  She then sat down for a few minutes and was then able to take the pill.  She denies any actual stridor or wheezing.  No focal weakness or numbness of one arm or leg.  No change in speech. Differential diagnoses include but are not limited to: CVA, TIA, anxiety reaction, paresthesia, metabolic process, bleed, vaccine reaction.  56-year-old female with paresthesia to the left chin.  Otherwise normal neurologic examination.  The TPA window given symptoms started yesterday.  I will get a head CT but I do not feel the patient needs an MRI.  Given the fact the patient does have autoimmune disorder, blood cultures and lactic acid obtained.  I suspect that her fever is in response to her Covid vaccine yesterday.  Covid test negative.  Urinalysis no evidence of UTI.  Chest x-ray is clear.  Head CT negative.  On reevaluation after Motrin patient feels much improved.  At this time I think she is stable for discharge to home.  I do not think this is Bell&#39;s I am finding no facial weakness on my examination.  Follow-up and return precautions discussed patient understood

                                                her throat itches; she could not breath; her pressure raised to 230; throat started to close; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband). A 56-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 56-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The husband commented that both of them got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 07Mar2021 and some minutes later, the patient started having a reaction that she had to be taken into the ER with an ambulance: her throat started to close, she could not breath and her pressure raised to 230. Until today, she has not fully recovered, and they have been getting in and out of the ER, in fact they just arrived home from there. Physicians only prescribed antiallergy medications and the patient was still having the same problem and her throat itches on an unspecified date. The physicians they have consulted have contradictive opinions about how she should do: one recommended her not to get the second dose while another recommended her to get started again on the series. The husband wants to know what they can do about this. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 56-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 24Mar2021 (Lot Number: ER2613) as a single dose for to prevent COVID (covid-19 immunisation). Medical history included having blood clot from 2019 to Mar2021 which the patient stated a couple of weeks ago (Mar2021), she had an ultrascan in her leg and the blood clot was not there, but she is on medication. The patient has recovered completely from blood clot (not ongoing). Concomitant medication included warfarin (WARFARIN) to prevent from having blood clot ongoing since Jun2019. The patient previously took gabapentin for pain but had throat started closing, allergic reaction, coughing and was intubated until she was released from hospital; and albuterol [salbutamol] for dyspnoea but had nebulizer to open up her airways and prevent closing and did not work (drug ineffective). The reporter mentioned that the patient ended up in the ICU because of the COVID vaccine. As soon as the vaccine was administered within seconds, the patient experienced a reaction and was given an epi pen, another epi pen even an epinephrine drip and was sedated and intubated. The reporter mentioned that they gave the patient the first shot of epi pen and it did not work, and she was given a second one and a third one plus steroids. By the time the ambulance people arrived, they hooked the patient up to an IV and gave her additional epinephrine and administered another epinephrine. The ambulance guy told her; she does not need to keep up with them because they needed to go to the hospital ASAP because the patient is not getting better but getting worse. Once the patient got to hospital, she was intubated because her throat was closing. The reporter stated that the patient has allergies to begin with and this was worse than the first time she had to be intubated. The epi pens did not work, the patient was intubated and then had to be sedated. The patient was on Propofol in order to sedate her and later on in the evening was given Fentanyl to relax her then the epinephrine drip was removed at 6 pm on 24Mar2021. The epinephrine drip was started in the emergency room and the patient could not be moved to the intensive care unit until she was somewhat stable. The patient was moved to the intensive care unit and was there overnight and by the time next morning she was able to be extubated where they removed the tube from her around 9:30 to 10:00 25Mar2021. Of course, the patient was taken off Propofol, but she went through a lot and her legs are sore, throat is sore, and is coughing on 25Mar2021 because of the side effects from being intubated and that she went through a lot. The intensive care unit doctor said that the patient can no longer have the vaccine and she would only be 70% protected till whenever they are not sure how long the vaccine will last. The adverse events almost took the patient&#39;s life which made the reporter angry at that. The reporter is not sure what the contents in the vaccine that it in the other drugs and vaccines since there is something that is contained in all of them and the patient was not allowed to have any whether it is the Pfizer or Moderna and it is even up for discussion for even the flu shot because of the reaction and there does not want to be any chances and that everything should be proceeded with caution. The reporter wanted to know what is in the COVID 19 vaccine to see about what could have caused the allergic anaphylactic reaction. The reporter stated and the fact that the epi pen did not work, she was taken aback. The reporter added that the doctor had a hard time intubating because of her throat but they were able to intubate from the second time. The reporter stated that it is taking a while but her wife is recovering and feeling it is taking a while taking a little bit longer. The reporter also stated that they kept the patient in the intensive care unit overnight and after the tube was removed in the morning, by the late afternoon she was moved to a different floor to continue to be observed and the intensive care doctor said 2 days out her wife would be safe to go. The patient stood up but it was hard for her to walk on 25Mar2021 because it could have been from the epi pen, but she is not sure. The patient stated the side effect came out of the allergic reaction and it was on Thursday 25Mar2021. Patient stated the main trouble is her breathing, she is out of breath still and really sore throat on 25Mar2021. The patient stated that the leg sore is still ongoing and is about the same. It was mentioned that the throat sore was still ongoing but some days are worse and some days are better. The patient stated that when she has a problem trying to swallow a tablet and digest it and it gets stuck on Mar2021. It was stated that the cough was not going away. The cough comes and goes away. She will cough for five minutes constantly and then it disappears then she will fall asleep and wake up coughing. It&#39;s as if she is choking (Mar2021). When she is talking, she coughs more. With regards to the allergic anaphylactic reaction, the patient stated she is experiencing the aftereffects of the allergic reaction and being intubated like being out of breath. The patient stated that will come in time and that&#39;s what happens when she gets intubated. Her breathing was heavy and comes back fully with rest on Mar2021. This has taken a lot out of her. She was feeling tired which was still ongoing it is about the same but comes and goes on 25Mar2021. The patient is experiencing lingering side effects and the patient does not feel as if she has recovered completely. It was also mentioned that the patient was intubated on 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021. It was reported that treatment of the patient included Epi Pen, Epinephrine Autoinjector USP 0.3 mg (Epinephrine injection manufacturer was Mylan) which the patient was given at least three injections (two in the right leg and 1 on the left) then received another in the ambulance (unknown site). Patient received an Epinephrine drip and it was like 0.1 mg all the way up until 6 pm (only on 24Mar2021). The epinephrine drip was started when patient was intubated at the hospital. It was given for patient&#39;s allergic reaction through IV. The patient&#39;s lungs were filling up with fluid so her airway was restricting her from breathing and to prevent damage of the lungs that is when the intubation came in. The patient also received Prednisone which the reporter does not recall when this medication was started it may have been after the epinephrine drip was removed but she is not sure if they started the prednisone after or if it was the same evening which the reporter kind of thinks it was. The reporter stated that the patient took Propofol 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 which was given through the patient&#39;s IV and was given to help her airways being intubated, they sedate their patients. The patient also received fentanyl which must have been added either right before Epinephrine drip was removed or after but reporter does not recall. Patient was given Fentanyl 24Mar2021 to 25Mar2021 through her IV. Patient received this medication to relax because sometimes it is like some patients tend to want to sit up and kind of hear you, hear what people are saying and to relax patient sometimes because they can get scared and not exactly sure what is going on. The events anaphylactic reaction, pulmonary oedema, throat constriction and breathing difficult. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lung was checked from a CT scan was unknown results on 12Jun2019, D dimer test was elevated on an unspecified date, ultrascan in her leg (ultrasound scan) blood clot was not there on Mar2021 and weight was probably weighs 180 or her weight may be a little less like 175 on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events anaphylactic reaction and throat constriction were recovering, as for the events leg pain, throat sore, cough and tiredness were not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

No treatment received. No covid tested post vaccination. Clinical course: She received the first Pfizer vaccine on 08Apr2021 evening, she thought it was easy, no problems. 12Apr2021 morning driving to work she started having sour belches, she got to work and ran to the bathroom, she vomited #6 times while having dark liquid diarrhea pouring out of her rectum, it finally stopped, 3 hours later it started again, she vomited 4 more times with more dark liquid pouring out of her rectum. Her boss sent me home. At home she was running back and forth to the bathroom the rest of the day with dark liquid diarrhea and another vomiting session throwing up #5 more times for a total of #15 Times. She could not sleep as her entire stomach area was swollen and in extreme pain just to touch and her back side was raw and bleeding. 13Apr2021 morning she vomited 3 times along with still having dark liquid diarrhea pouring out of her rectum and her stomach and back side were very pain full. 14Apr2021 she could not go to work again, she had no vomiting but continued with the on going dark liquid until 3:00 PM, she went to the bathroom and it was not liquid coming out of her rectum but a grey/taupe very soft stool. Her stomach area continued to hurt, she was still gassy. She only ate a banana, toast and Gatorade per the Dr. This was such a horrible experience. After the first shot she was praising the Pfizer Shot, now she would not. She did no really want the second shot after this experience. She was a new widow struggling, she had no one to help her, she had no phone as she had thrown up on her new phone and ruined it. This was such a terrible experience. The outcome of the events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 56-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 18Mar2021 10:30 (at age of 56 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included: Asthma, immune problems, upper respiratory stuff, all ongoing; Her Diagnosed allergies include iodine fish, Propofol, and preservatives, sleep apnea, had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough (Jan2021) from that. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took iodine, propofol and had allergies. Patient took first dose on 18Mar for reason that patient has lost all allergies that cannot be detected by blood work. After first short she was told to wait an extra 15 mins not vitals taken she can leave a felt like a specimen unpaid but paying with life. Patient started coughing while everyone watched her so she said she better take Benadryl cause she doesn&#39;t wanna die. Patient left had off balance couldn&#39;t see straight. She was the one that had all side effects from vaccine as well as COVID signs. She had research medicine/food that cause her to have anaphylaxis. Patient found same ingredients in vaccine but food and drug said it ok. Patient was an experiment. She need to no from your board it is ok for me to take 2nd vaccine. Patient should be getting paid. Her doctor making it seem it up to her she gotta go out and get and epi pen she cant afford. In running out of gloves and mask. The patient experienced Anaphylaxis, has been trapping food since in her throat, headache with numbness, Cough, blurred vision and nausea from headache, all on 18Mar2021. Caller has been coordinating with the CDC by email. Since day one she had a bad reaction to the COVID vaccine. This has been going on a month now. The CDC advised her not to get the second shot. She has went back and forth with the doctor. She had anaphylaxis from the vaccine. Her throat closed. She had irritation in her throat. She has been trapping food since in her throat. This has been since the anaphylactic reaction. She has to chew her food as fine as possible. She tries not to eat that much. This is still the same. It hasn&#39;t improved or worsened. She has also had a headache with numbness that is pretty much 24 hours a day. This started right after. She really felt it the next day. She tried to take Tylenol for four days, three times a day, and nothing happened. It was not going away. Her doctor also put her on a migraine medication, but it didn&#39;t work either. The headache has worsened over time. No medication is helping, and the doctors are confused. The migraine medicine is not helping. Her pressure is going up and down. She is wondering if she needs an emergency echo to see what is going on. She is still having bad effects. No doctor knows what to do. She has been to a lung specialist. Her cough just keeps getting worse. The cough started to get worse after the vaccine. She had COVID in Jan2021, and had a cough from that, but the vaccine made it worse. It is a ruff cough. She is on cough suppressant medication. Caller did not have a prescribing doctor. She got it at the hospital. She figured that was the safest, and since she is a patient there they emailed her because she was eligible to get it. She is mostly calling because the doctors don&#39;t know how to help. She is about to pass out from this headache. She is even losing vision from the headache. She feels like she is going to have a heart attack before her time. They are trying to figure out why her head is hurting. They do not think it is a migraine. Her headache is a 9/11 or a 10/12. She feels like after the vaccine she has been chemically off balance. She wants to get her thyroid checked too. Mostly because her food is getting trapped in her throat. Her throat is irritated and hoarse. The headache has given her blurred vision, and a felling like she is going to throw up. She feels off balance from the blurred vision. Caller had difficulty seeing information on Tylenol and Nurtec. She asked her husband to help. They cannot read the lot on the Tylenol. She has been to so many specialists to try to find answers, and no one has a clue. She saw on Pfizer&#39;s paperwork that she needs to reach out to a immunologist. Her allergist had no clue. From the world trade centers falling she has ongoing issues from that. She has sleep apnea, allergies, asthma, etc.  She spent 30 minutes being monitored at the hospital. She had started coughing. Her husband said she needed water. She always carries Benadryl with her. Finally she felt like she needed to take her Benadryl. It saved her. She knows the Benadryl probably won&#39;t work forever, but she cannot afford an epi Pen. Time of Onset (24 hours clock): right after vaccine (18Mar2021). All events require a visit to Physician Office. She didn&#39;t have to go the ER. She was lucky with the Benadryl. She takes Benadryl with her everywhere even to restaurants. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Treatment received for coughing, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache. The outcome of the event has been trapping food since in her throat, had irritation in her throat, headache with numbness, blurred vision and nausea from headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

She was sick for 5 weeks. She was never in the hospital or intubated. The site where she had the injection was large, red, hot, and itchy. It was from 22Apr2021 (Thursday) for the next maybe 3 days. Now the color is diminishing, the color is going down more like to pink and smaller and it not itching anymore. Once in a while she got a pinching sensation on her inner thigh ever since she had the injection. In the last couple days, she has been feeling a that a little more. She wanted to make sure it was not a symptom of a blood clot. She doesn&#39;t feel short of breath. She was nervous talking the call handler so that is why she is talking fast. She doesn&#39;t want to feel so sick like she did last year when she had it in March or April. She wanted to know that it&#39;s not a symptom of a blood clot. It was a throbbing pinching pain that goes and doesn&#39;t come back for a little bit, but it might come back a little bit later. It happened when she woke up. She has no swelling in her legs or thighs or anything else. She says she would not be talking this fast, but her heart was beating fast and she was nervous. She tended to be an anxious and nervous person. The patient never had blood clot issues. She wanted to make sure with everything that she has heard about Pfizer she hasn&#39;t heard of anyone having blood clot issues. She had to read to calm herself down a bit. It is a sharp pain with throbbing that comes and goes. She didn&#39;t read where it could be a blot clot, she just wanted to know. She is horrible at running to the hospital when she feels something because she gets so nervous and she thinks knowing is better because she&#39;s a realist. It takes her a minute to go to the hospital to figure it out. If she continues to feel like this she and her daughter will go to the emergency room. It is 5 blocks away. It is a small little hospital and they will be able to ease her mind. It could be her nerves getting to her too. Her fever got up to 100.3 and that was only on Saturday, 48 hours after the vaccine. Once she took Tylenol it was gone and didn&#39;t return again. She took her temperature; it was a beeping one. She always says she would take like 2 out of 3, and every time she took it went up. She felt a weird sensation of burning in her ears, the same as when she first had Covid, feeling like a fever. It brought her back to a bad place and it freaked her out. She is on disability and has people go to the store for her. She did that for 3 to 4 months. She is not agoraphobic, but she hadn&#39;t gone out until she got the vaccine. It took her all day to get back home because she loves the outdoors. It is kind of sad, and she knows she is not the only one who experienced that. She was able to actually stay at home, and when she went out, she wanted to stay. She still has her second dose to take, not everyone in has this and she doesn&#39;t want to feel that sick again. Eventually she will perish away one day, from God knows what but a slow death of not being able to breathe she cannot picture for herself or anybody else. She tries not to watch the news, it was depressing, because it is all over the news, she tries to stay in the loop. She was tired and had a headache. She took Tylenol and slept for an hour or hour and half. When she woke up she felt heaviness on her back and chest on the left side, and as she moved around more it was on her back and less on her chest. It was the same as she felt when she had Covid. She didn&#39;t have any aches or pains. The other thing was she had no appetite for the next 3 days. Every time she woke up, she felt extremely nauseous but had nothing to vomit. For the next 3 days or 72 hours, she had diarrhea. If she ate anything, she was in the bathroom. On 24Apr2021 (Saturday) after 48 hours she started to feel the heat in her neck and face and ears like right on her ears. She was talking to her daughter and her daughter said these are normal. Where she got the injection was itchy and a little more red. She told herself not to scratch it in her sleep, she is one of those people if something itches, she scratches. What she would do is rub her arm up and down on the site. It was almost the size of an 8 ounce tomato sauce can or maybe the size of a baseball. Then the third day it got redder. In her sleep she was rubbing her arm because it got itchy. Today the swelling went down, the color is like a light pink, and the size is also minimized. The fever lasted that night. She took her temperature again the next day and it was 97.9. That is usually what it is when she wakes up. She is not just tired; she is exhausted and feels like she has to go to sleep. Her daughter came with her granddaughter who is a baby, and she didn&#39;t know how to tell them. She was happy to see them but so exhausted. She worries about the sharp pain in her thigh. The other thing is she started getting pain in the middle of her thigh, her inner thigh. A sharp pain with like a throbbing is almost like a band-aid is too tight. If she rubbed her hand across her thigh, she could feel crushing and throbbing. She can feel it from touching the area. She had this before like when she is stretching. It started maybe 3 months ago and went away but then after she took the injection and heard about thing, she worried about a blood clot with Johnson &amp; Johnson, not that she would know because she has never had a blood clot. It could be psychosomatic and all working in her head. It started the last 2 days when she woke up, she felt fine and as she was lying in bed, she started feeling a sharp throbbing pain that eventually goes away. She has no swelling of her legs or thighs, and her daughter said it looks fine. She is semi-terrified of hearing bad news. It takes her longer to go to the hospital. If she starts feeling worse, she will be there in no time. She does not want to wait until it is worse, but she does not want to spook herself into going. She suffers from anxiety. She definitely had the fever not like she was just tired it was like she was exhausted. She got up early and would take a little nap because she was doing a bunch of stuff. That hasn&#39;t happened, but that&#39;s her. It will be 2300 when she goes to sleep. She was doing a bunch of stuff and felt like she just needed to take a nap. Maybe it is part of that too, but usually she doesn&#39;t feel tired like this. After her daughter left, she read something on her phone and passed out. When she woke up, she saw she actually dropped her phone. Her thigh is now not a pinch but more a little bit of a muscle pain. Now it is not like the inner thigh, it is more behind the thigh now, but not below the knee, right behind the thigh, closest to the knee but not on the knee. It is the same thing as if the middle had gone behind her thigh a bit. The little pillow on her chair is not helping anything either. It feels like it maybe muscular, its deep feeling. It feels like it could be muscle, if she rubs it, she can feel it. When asked has it improved persisted or worsened, caller states it is there, but it is dull. She can say there is pain, but it is a little duller just because it is more in the muscle. It is hard to explain, it was not the same throbbing pain but there is a dull pain, it goes around the chunkier part of her thigh, like the inner thigh. When she rubs it there is pain but a dull pain. When she rubs it, it feels better but she can still feel the site where it hurts. When she rubs it, it is still located right in the lower middle going toward her knee but not at the knee, maybe 3 to 4 inches away from the fold of her knee, almost at the center of her thigh almost. Almost like a dull muscle ache, there is a bit of throbbing with it. She will go to the doctor if something weird happens and will call back when they have an idea of what happened to her. This will sound crazy. The next thing she felt was a light throbbing where her belly button is but more to the left side, but not at the belly button. It was like at her stomach, not right at the belly button but right on the same line as her belly button but more at her waist. It was a small throbbing started today about an hour ago. She is hoping it is gas. Her fever went away pretty fast. She was on the phone and took her temperature to tell what it was. The woman said to take some Tylenol. It went from 99.9 to 100 to 100.3. She thought oh no. That was the highest she saw. Then eventually it started going down to 99.4, and then by morning it was back to normal. She only took Tylenol the one time. She is thinking maybe it is from being nervous and causing her body to heat up. She doesn&#39;t know she is just thinking. She thinks the fever went away the same day within an hour to 2 hours. She also wasn&#39;t drinking enough water. When asked if her fever has recovered completely or with last effects, caller states that is fine now, her temperature today was 99.4 without the fan on, she says she thinks that was pretty normal. When she first wakes up it is 97.9 usually. There was also a 98.4. The redness and itching at the injection site started 3 hours after the injection. She took her 2 sons with her. She took it and then her son took it. They said to wait 15 minutes. As soon as she stepped out, she looked up and felt so dizzy. It looks like when in summer and it seems to be boiling hot, that is how it got for her. Things got blurry. It was not like she was going to black out, but she had to close her eyes because the room was going to spin. She knocked back on the door and took a seat, so she sat down because she was not feeling right. When she gets nervous, she chews gum as a coping mechanism. Her son got some gum for her. She felt better but kind of nervous waiting for 15 minutes to go by, what if she felt dizzy again. She let 20 minutes go by and she got up and was fine. She wanted to be out of there and in the cool air outside. That is the first reaction that she had. She is one of those people that feel so nervous she is sure that happens that they feel like, oh they are so nervous, and they read so much, and it is in our faces everyday no matter what. Maybe it had nothing to do with the injection, maybe more that she was so nervous, but it was a weird sensation after. She knows when people first started getting the COVID vaccine, people were just like falling to the ground, she was like that would be terrible. She went with high expectations and was also nervous. Her heart was beating, and she could hear her own heartbeat. She still feels tired and like she can go take a nap now. She asks if that is normal. She would rather talk to Medical Information now. She is over this statistics part of it. She doesn&#39;t feel a release, she is just giving her information and she doesn&#39;t feel any better. Outcome of the event throbbing sensation to the left side of her belly button/It was like at her stomach was not recovered; of the event dizzy was recovered; of the events the injection was large, red, hot, and itchy/ the swelling went down, tiredness was recovering; of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), intramuscularly on 29Jan2021 at 09:30 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and known allergies to medication. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and metoprolol, which were reported as medications in two weeks. It was reported that other vaccines in four weeks were prescribed. On 31Jan2021 at 09:00 AM, the patient experienced the roof of her mouth shedded (was raw) and bled for a few days. A few days later (2021), she felt like she was having a heart attack. There was no treatment for the events. The patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on 2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the event myocardial infarction cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 on 31Mar2021 and 12 hours later (on 01Apr2021), sore arm, fever, chills and headache. Got a swollen lymph node in armpit, same arm as injection left side, today tip of left ring finger turned white and numb. She thinks it was Reynauds phenomenon. The patient called and told nurse in her doctor&#39;s office and they said if it was painful, it could be a pain clot. It was painful at first, that lymph node started 24 hours later with a sharp pain, and then she just assumed it could be a lymph node. Swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and it was very sore. The nurse told the patient to call Pfizer. The patient was fine until the tip of her finger happened. The patient said If it was painful it could be a blood clot, would need an x ray and asked if did the shot cause this. The complete ring finger left hand, the patient looked it up and it said it could happen to her feet and she looked, and her feet were modeled red, blue it was bizarre. Never happened before. The patient was not happy about getting the vaccine, she already had covid in November of last year (2020). The patient wouldn&#39;t have called if it wasn&#39;t for her finger. Not just her feet, her hands got like this too. The patient didn&#39;t want to get the second shot. The patient asked if there was any information or mandate on timing information for the second dose, should she needed to postpone it. The patient asked if what was the efficacy after first dose as she felt like she was immune because she had the virus and now the vaccine. She was very hesitant to get the Covid 19 vaccine. She thinks her body created Covid 19 antibodies. A couple days ago she was very sick. The swollen lymph node started with a sharp pain and could be a blood clot as far as she knows (in 2021). Even putting on deodorant she can tell it&#39;s there, it was very sore and there&#39;s a lump. Today (on 01Apr2021), she noticed the tip of her finger got white it was numb. She looked it up online and she thinks it was Reynaud&#39;s phenomenon. She has a picture if Pfizer needed it. The finger was on the same arm that she received her vaccine in. It was the ring finger on left hand. Once it started happening her finger felt funny and felt numb. She put her finger under warm water. She reported that the white color was maybe a third of the way down towards her knuckle. She was asking if this was normal or has this been reported. She had called her doctor today and spoke with the nurse who told her to call the CDC and report her symptoms. She needed her glasses trying to give her primary care doctor&#39;s phone number. The patient wanted to add that she has something like gout in her foot and on that side too, the left foot, it was pulsing and throbbing all night. She&#39;s had this pain in her left foot, she thinks its gout because it was all the symptoms of gout and she had it for a while, it hurts off and on but that night it was hurting and throbbing. She has not been diagnosed with gout in that left foot. She still has a headache but today she felt good except for her finger turning white and going numb. The lymph node in her armpit hurts. Her doctor&#39;s nurse told her if its painful to the touch it could be a blood clot so she was nervous about that. The tip of her finger was completely white and the rest of her hands were blue and red and white and yellow. She reported that her finger was back to normal now. She didn&#39;t want to get too inoculated since she also had the Covid 19 virus. The events did not require visit to emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events was unknown for thrombosis, Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon, erythema, cyanosis, illness, visual impairment, and gout while for the remaining events was recovering.

EMS was called as I made my way outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then  began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.  When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.  She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; palpitations; tachycardia/heart rate 141; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (HCP). This HCP reported similar events for 2 patients. This is 1st of two reports.  This 58-year-old female HCP (patient) reported for herself that received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176) on 10Jan2021 at 0.3 mL single by intramuscular injection left arm for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included ongoing hypertension and diabetes type 2, both diagnosed about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EH9899) on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that a few days after receiving the 2nd dose (on 14Jan2021), she went into atrial fibrillation and had been having palpitations ever since. She had a cardiology appointment in a few weeks and they started her on apixaban (ELIQUIS). Lab data on 14Jan2021 included EKG: normal sinus and Kardiamobile (a medical grade ECG): it showed tachycardia and at least one other time showed atrial fibrillation, heart rate 141. The outcome of palpitations was not recovered, outcome of other events was unknown. Reporter seriousness for atrial fibrillation and palpitations was medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of  atrial fibrillation cannot be fully excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.  ,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021111803 same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

                                                bilateral pulmonary emboli; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician. A 58-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: unknown, Expiration Date: unknown) via intramuscular in the left arm on 05Mar2021 10:15 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included psoriatic arthritis and asthma. Patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: unknown, Expiration Date: unknown) on 12Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. On 09Mar2021 17:00 (5.00 PM), the patient experienced bilateral pulmonary emboli, which resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The patient received blood thinners as treatment for the event. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested. ; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the event bilateral pulmonary emboli mostly represented intercurrent condition in this patient with advanced age, unrelated to Bnt162b2. Relevant medical history and concurrent treatments are missing for a medically meaningful assessment.

                                                This was a 58 year old female who received her 1st dose Pfizer on 4/6/21 (Lot# EW0175) and 2nd dose Pfizer on 4/27/21 (Lot# EW0151).  Of note, the patient was in a motor vehicle accident on 4/12/21 with a diagnosis of concussion and cervical/thoracic strain/sprain (see history under patient information).  On 4/29/21, the patient&#39;s sister contacted the patient&#39;s primary care clinic with the following documented concern:  &#34;Pt&#39;s sister calling to report that two days ago pt got 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine and has been sick. This morning they found her passed out against the her bedroom door. Pt reports that she can&#39;t remember much other than going to the bathroom.  Pt&#39;s sister states that patient totaled her car a week ago, and that it was determined she had a concussion.  &#34;She hasn&#39;t been herself since the wreck and I am very concerned.&#34; This caller recommenced the Ed or UC but caller denied stating that either needs to see her today. This writer is reaching out to nurse to see if they can advise from here.&#34; A RN assessed the patient virtually with the following documentation:  &#34;RN note:  Call transferred from patient&#39;s sister.  Pt noted to be found on her floor this morning. Pt unsure if she hit her head.  Spoke to patient.  She reports body aches, and feeling weak.  Pt is slow to answer questions, and had a lot of difficulty hearing me (sister did not have any difficulty hearing me).  Pt is noted to have more rapid breathing, and some slight wheezing.  Speech is clear when she is speaking.  Sister gave patient water to drink.  She drank out of bottle and was able to hold on her own (though had difficulty with this at first).  Sister noted some water dripping down face, but was able to swallow okay.  Sister also noted that patient&#39;s lips seem to be pursed. Plan: Given recent concussion, and patients change in behavior per sister (pt more irritable, speaking more slowly, moving slowly, breathing faster, and wheezing), recommended patient be taken to the ED today--recommended ambulance since it took 2 men to help patient back to bed this morning.  Sister states patient is not agreeable to going to ED at this time.  Advised to try to encourage her to drink more fluids, and continue to monitor her sxs, and if any worsening, to call for ambulance transport.  Sister agreeable to plan, and will discuss with sister, and recommend ED visit today.&#34; On 4/30/21, the patient&#39;s sister contacted the clinic to inform them that the patient was found dead that morning.  The medical examiner is completing the further investigation. If additional information is needed from the primary care physician for this patient.

The patient received her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on 09Apr2021. She was sick all day the day after (10Apr2021) but was fine by Sunday. On Monday, 12Apr2021, she mentioned that she underwent radiation therapy, then noticed that her injection site was swollen, red, and warm to the touch on 13Apr2021. On 10Aapr2021, her heart rate also went up because she is scheduled for chemo, radiation and has an a-flutter. She mentioned that the COVID shot made it go up. She is asking how long these side effects should last and for what to do. She mentioned that the nurse at her doctor&#39;s office told her to contact Pfizer on what to do. She is a high-risk cancer patient. She received her second dose of the COVID vaccine on 09Apr2021. The next day, she experienced tiredness, a headache, chills, and body aches. She also had a fever of 99.4, 99.7, and 100.8. She was feeling unwell. Then she got a fast heartbeat. She has been having that problem. She has A-Fib and A-Flutter. She has been doctoring every week about her A-Fib and A-Flutter. Then she was fine. On Monday, she had radiation. After radiation, on Tuesday, 13Apr2021, her arm at the injection site was swollen, red and hurting. Then her heartbeat started back beating fast. She has had a headache on and off. She had a headache on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. She does not look at her weight. She has gained so much weight since cancer. She retains liquids because of her cancer. She is probably about 230 pounds. She has been tired because of her cancer. But this was different, this was extreme tiredness. Began on Saturday, 10Apr2021 whenever she woke up. With her cancer, she cannot sleep. After the second dose of the covid vaccine, she was so tired, she actually rested well. She was feeling yucky, with chills, a headache and a fever. She is grateful that she was able to get some sleep. It was completely resolved on Sunday morning, 11Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Bad headache began on Saturday, 10Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Sleeping relieved her headache. She took some Tylenol even though she is not supposed to take Tylenol because of her chemotherapy. Tylenol could affect her liver because of the chemotherapy. She took the Tylenol for her fever and to help her headache. Her headache is on and off, but it is a lot better since her first headache. Her headache was the worst on the first day. She thought her symptoms were clear until her arm at the injection site was swollen, red and hurting. It was also hot to touch. Chills, body aches and fever of 99.4, 99.7, and 100.8, feeling unwell began on Saturday, 10Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Completely resolved on Sunday morning, 11Apr2021 whenever she woke up. Her heart started racing on Saturday, 10Apr2021. Then it resolved on Sunday, 11Apr2021. Then her fast heartbeat came back whenever her arm at the injection site started to get swollen, red and hurting. She thinks that her fast heartbeat could be anxiety too. She has anxiety. She takes heart medications that are supposed to slow her heart down. The medications are not working. Chemotherapy makes her heart worse. She called her doctor about her heart beating fast. She has not heard back from her doctor yet. Usually her doctor will up her mediations. Now tomorrow, she will be filling her body with poison. Chemotherapy makes her heart worse. Chemotherapy name, lot number, NDC and expiration date: Not provided. The Pfizer covid vaccine made her heart worse. She is supposed to get chemotherapy tomorrow. She does not know what will happen tomorrow. She thinks that her doctor is going to have to up her medications. She has been seeing her heart doctor every week. Because of radiation, she has not seen her as much. She is going to see her heart doctor on Tuesday. Her heart doctor has been doctoring her for forever, and she sees her every week since she was diagnosed with cancer. She prefers for Pfizer to contact her heart doctor if there are any follow up questions. She had to have surgery, and after that she went into A-Flutter. Her heart doctor has been on it since. Clarified that her heart medications normally do work. She thinks that the COVID vaccine counteracted her heart medications. Normally her heart rate is under 100. After the COVID vaccine, at 7:00PM, her pulse was 104. On Saturday, at 4:30PM, her heart rate was 111. At 8:00PM, it was 109. On Sunday, it got better. At 7:30AM, it was 96. At 6:00PM, it was 90.

After radiation, on Tuesday, 13Apr2021, her arm at the injection site was swollen, red, hurting and tender to touch. Her heart started beating fast again. The redness is the whole width of her arm. She is asking how long she can expect this redness to last. She does not know if radiation triggered this. It happened right after radiation that she started on Monday. Her daughter told her that this is normal, and a lot of people have this happen. The day before the second dose of the COVID vaccine, she had internal radiation. That was her third radiation treatment. She told her oncology doctor about the COVID vaccine and her doctor talked to her about it. Her doctor told her to go on and get the COVID vaccine, and that people like her needed the vaccine. She did not have radiation with first dose of the COVID vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of bad headache and fever of 99.4, 99.7, and 100.8. The outcome of the events sickness, fever, chills, feeling abnormal, body aches and feeling unwell was recovered on 11Apr2021, headache was recovering, while of the rest was unknown.

The patient received the Second dose of Pfizer on 14Mar2021, states, &#34;On 17Apr2021, Saturday, nose bleed started, and my blood pressure went up. I Called ambulance took blood pressure and it was 210/107. I didn&#39;t go to hospital, nose bleed had stopped while they were there, I stayed in ambulance until blood pressure came down. Sunday I went to ER  (emergency room) because my nose started bleeding again, it stopped Sunday, but they checked the nose, nothing was there. I stayed in the hotel, Monday morning I blood again, Tuesday I bled even more starting at 7am and it didn&#39;t stop. Went to the hospital to ER (emergency room), they packed my nose to stop it from  bleeding, clots were coming out, clots coming both ways, they checked blood, not anemic, everything okay with blood.  on 23rd they removed the pack from nose, ENT told me no vessels were broken, he said I was fine. That is when I received a phone call about someone else having this problem. A week later a class mate said her sister had the same reaction after getting the Pfizer vaccine.&#34; She was calling about the Covid 19 vaccine. She received her second vaccine on 14Mar2021 and had no problems during that time. On 17Apr2021 she called an ambulance because she had a nosebleed. Her blood pressure was also high at that time around 210/107mmHg. Her nosebleed stopped with emergency management technicians and her blood pressure came back down. She did not go to the emergency room at this time. On 18Apr2021 at around 3:00AM, she had another nosebleed and she did go to the emergency department at about 10:00AM. She has never had a nosebleed before. When she was examined in the emergency room on 18Apr2021, she had no blood in her nose that the doctor could see. On 19Apr2021 around 7:00AM she had another nosebleed but the nosebleed stopped and she did not go back to the emergency room. On 20Apr2021, her nose started bleeding around 5:00AM and it didn t stop so she went back to the emergency room around 7:00AM and the doctor in the emergency room packed her left nostril and the blood was coming out of the right nostril and out of her mouth. She was bleeding for a few more minutes and then the bleeding stopped. Her blood pressure was fine. Her bloodwork was checked and everything was fine. She wasn t anemic or anything like that. She didn t have an bad effects from the nosebleeds. The emergency room told her to follow up with her primary care doctor on Thursday, 22Apr2021, but her primary care doctor no longer takes her insurance. She did go see an Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor on Friday, 23Apr2021. The Ear, Nose, and Throat doctor removed the nasal packing and examined the inside of her nose and told her that he could not see any broken vessels or any cause as to why she would be having nosebleeds. The patient&#39;s apartment is being renovated and she thought she might be having a reaction to the hotel she s staying in. She moved out of her apartment on 12Apr2021 and her nosebleeds started 17Apr2021. She has missed work because of her nosebleeds and she started back to work this week. When probing for her Covid 19 vaccine information she reports she does not have the vaccine record card with her. She received the second Covid 19 vaccine on 17Mar2021. NDC/Lot/Expiry not known. First Covid 19 vaccine date is in the suspect product field. She does not have the NDC/Lot/Expiry for the first date either. She reports she had a regular physical with her doctor in Nov2020.

I was in the library at the time.  Several people ran to my side and sat me down on the floor. My O2 sat was 86, pulse 120. I was able to start breathing without epi. O2 went up to 100. Was taken to the ED and given Benadryl and Prednisone. I waited quite a long time. The ED was packed. I ended up leaving, as I felt fine. I am fine today and at work. This was my second vaccine.  No adverse event after the 1st dose.

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 09Mar2021, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included exposure to SARS-COV-2 on 02Mar2021 (reported as &#34;daughter tested positive for COVID on 02Mar2021, patient had been around their daughter and their daughter&#39;s husband, they went out to eat with them on the night of 02Mar2021&#34;). Concomitant medication included esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 09Mar2021, the patient received her first shot. About 20 minutes after she took the shot, she started feeling bad and became nauseated/felt sick to stomach. On 09Mar2021, the top part of her stomach would hurt, and she started developing a cough. On 11Mar2021, the patient felt like she doesn&#39;t have any energy. The coughing went pretty bad so on 12Mar2021, the patient took a COVID-19 PCR test and it came back negative. The patient kept having a bad cough so then they went to the doctor where they put the patient on prednisone 20 mg and amoxicillin 875 mg on 12Mar2021. On 16Mar2021, the patient went to the family doctor and the doctor put the patient on azithromycin and gave her a steroid shot. Then the patient kept coughing and her stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage. The patient was never getting better or anything. So, on 18Mar2021, the patient had COVID-19 Virus test where they swabbed her nose and the test came back negative. The patient was taken to the hospital on 19Mar2021 at 11:30 where they did an x-ray of the patient&#39;s lungs and her O2 level was 82-86 sitting in the bed (also reported as 84-86 so she was put on oxygen), performed CT scan of her lungs and it looked like there was inflammation in the lower lungs that was rubbing on her diaphragm, and performed Chest CT which determined pneumonia. That night they did another COVID-19 virus test where they went really deep and it came back negative. The patient was admitted to the hospital on the night of 19Mar2021. The patient was given IV ceftriaxone, IV azithromycin, azithromycin (also reported as Zythromax), one breathing treatment, and they said they may have to send the patient home with some oxygen. It was also reported that on 19Mar2021, the patient did really good with coughing, she didn&#39;t cough that much. The patient had a dry cough that wasn&#39;t productive at all. The patient acted kind of short of breath because she wasn&#39;t breathing deep because of the pain in the top part of her stomach, but the reporter doesn&#39;t believe it was true shortness of breath. When the patient got out of the hospital on 22Mar2021, she didn&#39;t need to come home with the oxygen. The patient&#39;s oxygen level is running pretty good at the time of the report, in the lower 90s (Mar2021). The patient was on Decadron 6 mg for 5 days and she&#39;s doing pretty good, she still has a little bit of a cough. It was also reported that in Mar2021, the patient only ate about half of her breakfast, this lasted for several days, she wouldn&#39;t eat much. The patient pretty much recovered from the nausea. When she ate, it felt like everything would make it to her stomach and just sit there. The emergency room doctor said it could be from gastroenteritis, also they gave the patient several rounds of Protonix. The patient usually takes Nexium every night. The doctor felt that this event could very well be from the vaccine. The reporter asked if the patient could get the second shot on 30Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Cough/bad cough/dry cough&#34;, &#34;Stomach pain/top part of her stomach would hurt/stomach was hurting right at the bottom of her rib cage&#34;, and &#34;O2 level was 82-86/ Oxygen level was like 84 or 86 so she was put on oxygen&#34;; has recovered from &#34;nauseated/felt sick to stomach&#34; on an unspecified date.

                                                To summarize our conversation, you stated that you received the second Pfizer vaccine on 3/4/21.  Three days later, on 3/7/21, you began to have fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness and chest pressure. Because all symptoms continued for 24 hours, on the evening of 3/8/21, you took yourself to the Emergency Department.  Your ER work-up included a CXR (negative), an EKG (showing a left bundle branch block), serum bloodwork (negative for MI), however, the D-dimer and spiral CT were both positive for a pulmonary emboli (i.e. a blood clot in your lungs).  You were admitted to the hospital and started on the blood thinner, Eliquis.  During your 3-day hospital stay, your work-up also included a bilateral lower extremity Doppler study (negative) and an echocardiogram (showing left ventricular hypertrophy).  You were discharged on all of your previously prescribed medications (see list below), except for the fish oil.  You were also started on Eliquis.  Since discharge, you have followed up with your PCP and have been referred to a cardiologist and pulmonologist.  To date, you have had no further symptoms.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, pre-diabetes.  PRE-VACCINE MEDICATIONS:  losartan, HCTZ, amlodipine, Welchol, fenofibrate, fish oil.  POST-ER VISIT MEDICATIONS:  losartan, HCTZ, amlodipine, Welchol, fenofibrate, Eliquis.

A 59-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: ENB207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 19Mar2021 08:00 AM (at the age of 59-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma since 1990, obese since 1990, Congestive heart failure about 4 years ago in 2017, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease since 1989; all were ongoing. She had a chemical exposure in a small town that started the COPD since about 1989. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received fluzone on unspecified date for flu vaccine and caused COPD exacerbation, she was given doxycycline and prednisone with that. The patient is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19, her first dose she received on 19Mar2021. She isn&#39;t going to take the second Covid 19 vaccine. On 19Mar2021 at 7:00PM on the day she received her Covid 19 vaccine her arm was killing her all the way down/ arm hurt so bad she wanted to cut it off. That lasted the whole next day and she took 2 Tylenol arthritis pills. Her arm was real sore the next day but it wasn&#39;t paining her like it was that first day. It was still a little sore but not like it was. The pain was down the whole arm.  Last week (on unspecified date in Mar2021), she started getting headaches and chills.  She&#39;ll get a chill and the chill will go away. Then a couple hours later the chills will come back. Her headache comes and goes. She checked her blood pressure and her blood pressure is normally low, she checked it and it was 117/76 in 2021. She knew her blood pressure wasn&#39;t causing her headaches. And she checked her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 and it was good. She normally does not have headaches. She&#39;s on 4L of oxygen because of congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Her breathing has been, she can&#39;t describe it. Her doctor prescribed some steroids yesterday, 30Mar2021. She is asking if this is normal after 2 weeks. When asking her about her breathing she reports it&#39;s like her chest is tighter and she has shortness of breath. If she moves, her oxygen level on unspecified date in 2021 drops with the slightest little movement. Her oxygen has been dropping into the 70s and she has to do the pursed lips breathing to recover. It&#39;s taking a while to recover. She has to really work to get her oxygen back into the 90s. That started last week some time. She did call her doctor and her doctor prescribed prednisone and doxycycline (Prednisone 4, 10 mg tablets for 3 days, then 3 tablets for 3 days, then 2 tablets for 3 days, then 1 tablet for 3 days and Doxycline Hyclate 100mg 1 capsule twice daily for 7 days). She forgot to mention that her left leg hurts from her knee to her hip on unspecified date in 2021. That started a couple days ago. She didn&#39;t have any problems with her hip before. She&#39;s scared because the second vaccine is more potent, it&#39;s worse. She doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;s going to get that second Covid 19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 59-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot number ER8727, expiration date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 07Apr2021 12:00 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergy ( macro Danton, sulfa). Patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included Nerontin. The patient reviously received flu vaccine and had normal things, previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN5318; Expiration Date: 31May2021) in arm left on 17Mar2021 16:00 and experienced acute lymphatic response, brain fog and arm started to hurt. The pateint was calling because her doctor, who she saw yesterday 14Apr2021, told her she should let Pfizer know what was going on. She had a reaction to the Pfizer Covid19 Vaccine. she was now having PVCs. The patient added that all of the events started with a fever, and throwing up. She had a fever and threw up for 36 hours. She had to contact her physician to get medication and to stop vomiting and the nausea and everything. During that time, she was sick. She was having intermittent breathing issues which she did not think she felt too much of until after the other sickness was over. She was weak, like people get after they are sick, and had bizarre shaking legs and arms which was strange. She added that she had breathing issues and difficulty breathing and hard to get a breath. That was what she was dealing with. Treatment: caller took Pedialyte and all the proper things to get back into better shape. The breathing issue still remained. The doctor called in a rescue inhaler. She kept going downhill so he called in a rescue inhaler. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Caller added that this one will not be believed but on Monday, she woke up and got dressed again and was just weak and had breathing issues but was just doing work on the laptop. She did not fall, she did not run into anything. In the evening, she went to take a bath and saw that when she took her clothes off there was a large black bruise on her left breast, it was probably 2 inches in diameter. It is very large, but does not hurt like a bruise. She checked the rest of her body for blood issues and only saw a couple normal looking bruises. She contacted her doctor, and they questioned her thoroughly on her bruising and activity. This was on Monday. Tuesday, she still felt the same headache, weak, and breathing issues. PVCs (Ventricular premature beat) after second vaccine: Yesterday, 14Apr2021, she started declining and the doctor wanted to see her. Caller stated the doctor heard PVCs in her heart. Caller asked clarification of PVC abbreviation and does not provide. She never had heart issues ever. The doctor did blood work and a chest x-ray, and saw the bruise and was worried about her blood. Caller added that even though these are not listed as side effects of the vaccine, she was worried. Her doctor sent her to a facility for chest x-rays to make sure there is no pulmonary embolism. Caller confirmed this was on 14Apr2021. She has not yet heard back. PVCs after second vaccine: Caller added the doctor said her lungs sounded good but wanted to see what was going on to see how her breathing was because there was difficulty. The doctor wanted to cover bases and check. Today, caller can tell her heart is still not in correct rhythm and that it is in continued PVCs. She still had the same breathing issues, limbs were weak, she was shaky, and she is lightheaded. She was hoping to wake up today and feel better. Fever after second vaccine: started 3am 08Apr2021. She had a fever and was throwing up at this time. Throwing up and nausea after second vaccine: caller add that throwing up and vomiting with nausea occurred at 3 am, all of this occurred 08APR2021. The vomiting lasted 36 hours, and it ended when she took medication. The fever lasted 40 hours. Even after the medication worked for her fever, she had nausea. Around Friday was when it went away. Intermittent breathing issues after second vaccine: caller adds it started with throwing up and fever, but she did not think a lot about this or know when it started because she was dealing with the fever and vomiting. It continued, and it has not subsided or ended. As a matter of fact, there are 2 or 3 times it has gotten bad which is why she was given an inhaler. Treatments: caller took a Phenergan suppository, which she adds is the best medicine in the World for nausea and beats Zofran. She had used two or three doses and it did work. She used a rescue inhaler, Albuterol Sulfate HFA. She took Tylenol for fever. She is also now taking an aspirin daily because of the blood issues. No additional information regarding the products. Weak after second vaccine: caller adds that this started at the same time, she was over the nausea and noticed this. It felt different than what it feels like with the flu. This is still going on, she did not think too much about it but it has persisted. Sometimes there is a little bit of shaking but that is intermittent. Caller states she can not put it into words. Bizarre shaking legs and arms after second vaccine: this goes with the weakness, she is continually weak but she has a shaky feeling that will come every now and then and is random. Large black bruise on left breast after second vaccine: Monday this started, 12APR2021 and it is still there but it is the same. It has not been sore like a bruise but it is black and large. The physician has seen it now and it is bizarre and scary. It is the left breast on the outside.  Headache after second vaccine: started probably an hour after the vaccine, pretty quick. There were degrees to this headache because it was an actual migraine for a good 48 hours and even after the fever was gone it was terrible. It started out just a mild headache and then was very severe for a couple of days. Then, after that it was just there but not as severe. PVCs after second vaccine: caller adds that she went to the doctor yesterday 14APR2021 and she can tell every now and again that she is having these but there is nothing she can do about it. Caller adds this is everything new she can think of, but some of it is foggy, she thinks this is the main information. Brain fog after first and second vaccine: Caller then states, by the way, after both vaccines within 2 or 3 minutes of having them her head started feeling foggy and weird.  Investigations: caller has not received any results yet. She did get an EKG, Chest XRAY, blood work, and the doctor also rattled off a bunch of things the doctor was going to check. These all were on 14Apr2021 and she is waiting on results. Caller confirms the physician told her she had PVCs while listening to caller&#39;s heart. Did any AE require a visit to: Physician office? 15Apr2021 she was in contact with her physician, and the whole week they were on the phone. Yesterday 14Apr2021 the physician wanted to see her. The doctor figured out something was going on with her heart so thankfully the doctor wanted to see her. It was discussed if caller should go to the ER but caller did everything she could not to go because that is the last place she wants to go. Emergency Room: no. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of fever, vomiting, nausea was recovered, intermittent breathing issues, shaking legs and arms, weak, severe migraine, headache was not recovered, for other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 59-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8737), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 05Apr2021 08:30 (at the age of 59years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis (not bad enough that she takes treatment, but she is diagnosed; she was diagnosed way back in 2006). Concomitant products: patient stated she takes some medications (not further specified). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that she had her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 05Apr2021 and got very sick. She was down for two days and after day 10 (as reported) she has a blood clot under her eye. She would like to know what would happen if does not get a second dose. She consulted if there is any talk on whether or not people should receive an additional dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine next year. The patient further reported that on 06Apr2021 she woke up feeling crummy right away and a couple of hours into that day she couldn&#39;t lift her arm, literally couldn&#39;t lift arm for 6 inches and stated it went on for 2 days. She further stated that her arm hurt all the way below her arm pit into her breast. She stated that it all ended on 08Apr2021 and she went back to work on 08Apr2021. The patient added that she was down for two days, had headaches, and stated she never knew what people meant when they said they got hit by train. She doesn&#39;t believe she had a fever and couldn&#39;t move. The patient further stated that she got pretty darn sick and this morning 14Apr2021, she woke up with a blood clot under her eye. She is an esthetician and is pretty good with skin. She stated that she doesn&#39;t know how she could get this overnight unless she injured herself in her sleep, but she is a light sleeper. She does not know if it is a clot. She also stated that she called a medical esthetician who told her to take a baby aspirin and cold compress. The patient clarified that she didn&#39;t feel so good and today she feels better. She doesn&#39;t know that it is a blood clot, it is not raised and not hard, it looks like she has a bright red bruise in the corner of the eye to the middle of the eye underneath, not in the eye. She wants to make it clear she doesn&#39;t know if it is a blood clot. She feels like if she hurt herself, that would be the reason, but it would be painful, and it is not. She added that the bruise is about the same. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events (except for feeling down and couldn&#39;t move). The outcome of events thrombosis and contusion was not recovered; the outcome of other events was recovered on 08Apr2021.

A 59-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 05Feb2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included high blood pressure and did have surgery in Jan2021, a week before she received the Covid 19 vaccine. She had screws placed in her foot. Her foot had been injured from being twisted too many times. It was an old injury. Concomitant medications included atenolol; omeprazole; venlafaxine; and hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN/HCTZ TEVA); all ongoing. Probably about 15 years ago, she received a flu vaccine where her husband worked. His place of employment offered flu vaccines to employees and their families every year. She went to get the flu vaccine and that was probably around 9:00AM and by the time she got off work that day she was so sick with the chills that she crawled into bed. It felt like she had the flu. The next day she felt better just worn out. She hasn&#39;t had a flu vaccine since then. She received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 05Feb2021 and about 20 minutes after (05Feb2021 13:50), she received the vaccine her hands started itching and she didn&#39;t think a lot about it. As time wore on, the itching moved up her arms and down her legs and then her whole body was itching. By Sunday, 07Feb2021 she had a rash and welts and the rash was moving up in her face. She went to the emergency room on Sunday, 07Feb2021 because the rash was on her face. She was getting scared. She was miserable. She was taking Benadryl and it wasn&#39;t doing anything for her. The emergency room gave her a Benadryl injection and liquid steroids and prescribed 2 epinephrine pens (Epi-pens) in case she started to have problems breathing. She did not have trouble breathing. She also received pills to help with her itching. She was still taking those pills because she was still itching. As of 23Apr2021, it was still persisting nothing has improved slightly. It keeps her up at night, making her miserable, and described it as severe. She had spots where she bleeds from scratching.  She was up all night two days ago because the itching was so bad.  The pills do help but she has to work so she can not take too many or she will be asleep at her desk. Patient hoped that Pfizer would have something to tell her healthcare provider about what to do for her. She was advised by her doctor to not get the second Covid 19 vaccine.  She went to her family doctor about a week later and explained what had happened with the Covid 19 vaccine and her doctor was able to review her emergency room visit paperwork. Her primary care doctor prescribed more of the pills for itching because she had gone through the pills that the emergency department prescribed. She reported that the rash has improved but at times, all of a sudden, she&#39;ll start itching and it&#39;s the type of itching that she can&#39;t stop scratching. With scratching it will grow into welts and a rash and then it goes away. She doesn&#39;t like to take the pills prescribed for itching because she doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. The itching kept her up all night in different parts of her body. The itching will ease down and then the itching will stop and then probably a good hour will pass and the rash will go away. The only thing that was left to see was where she scratched on her body. She still has red spots on her arms that weren&#39;t there before. She wouldn&#39;t call those spots a rash. The pill she was prescribed for itching is Hydroxyzine 25mg take one by mouth every 6 hours as needed for itching. This one helps but she doesn&#39;t want to take it because it can make her tired and she has to work. Outcome of the event &#34;hands started itching/itching moved up her arms and down her legs and then her whole body was itching&#34; was not recovered while unknown for other events.

I was rapid COVID tested on 3/26/2021 the nurse at CVS asked why my blood oxygen was low. I did not know but had me pant and move my fingers and it went up to 96. I also remember severe leg pain on a drive 3/25/21. I noticed shortness of breath 4/5/21 and fast pulse but didnot go to hospital until 4/18/21. I previously had a PE 7/2009 and also had it for ~2 weeks before going to hospital. I was not on blood thinner since 2015. The doctors at the hospital and primary care doctor did not seem to think the PE was vaccine related but they also do not believe I had symptoms for over 3 weeks.
