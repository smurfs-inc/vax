                                                Episode of atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 60-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 13Jan2021 09:15 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not pregnant. Medical history included scoliosis and depression. Concomitant medications in two weeks included duloxetine hydrochloride (CYMBALTA), estradiol/norethisterone acetate (COMBIPATCH). Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number, EH9899) received on 20Dec2020 05:00 PM at left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously took codeine and experienced drug allergies. The patient experienced episode of atrial fibrillation on 17Jan2021 at 05:45 AM. No treatment received, no COVID prior vaccination. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between event episode of atrial fibrillation and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

All events lead to hospitalization for 5 days (PENDING CLARIFICATION) and received IgG and oral Dexamethas as treatment. On 20Jan2021, the patient did Sars Co V 2 RNA test via Nasal Swab and result negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a close chronological association, a causal relationship between events petechiae and thrombocytopenia and  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

                                                Received first shot on 3/15/21. On 3/25/21, I developed a rash (hives) around 6:30-7pm. After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

A 60-years-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 15Mar2021 at 17:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EP8534) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Only occasional migraines. Never anything like this and known allergies: Some grasses. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination.

On 18Mar2021, at 8pm, the patient reported that &#34;3 days after 2nd shot I started itching in my arms and chest in the evening. Went to bed and woke up at 4 am to pee. Afterwards I blacked out and work up on the bathroom floor. My rash was worse and spreading and chest hurt to breathe and I had bumps on head so we called # and nurse and my husband drove me to (Name). They gave me an IV and epinephrine shot and Pepcid and did CT scan of head and blood work. Diagnosed Anaphylaxis. They sent me home a couple hours later with prescription for Epi pens Zyrtec and Famotidine. Over the course of Friday my rash/hives got worse and spread over my body and my lips /mouth started to swell. I called the nurse who suggested I come back in and they checked by throat to ensure it wasn&#39;t closing up and gave me ibuprofen and Benadryl and sent me home. Rash/hives worse and spread all over body and face when I woke up Saturday morning (today). Plan to see specialist Sunday or Monday.&#34; The outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after vaccination.

It continued for several days. I called PCP and was seen. Chest Xray &amp; bloodwork was done. Was called to go to E.R. for CT scan of lungs. Pulmonary Embolisims were seen and a blood thinner was given. Heart monitored for previous Afib (ablation performed 5 yrs ago). CT scan w/dye was done of abdomen, Right leg ultrasound with compare L, MRI w/contrast done of abdomen/pelvis. No reason has been found for cause of several blood clots in both lungs - sub arteries. Am being followed up by Vascular Doctors in 2 weeks.

She has a history of low blood pressure, never high. They did an angiogram that came back normal and an MRI as well. They have been unable to find a cause of the stroke at this time. She was in ICU for four days then Neuro PCU for about 4 days and now she is in inpatient rehab. She is currently learning to walk and has weakness on her whole left side. Vision issues. And motor control issues of the left arm.   The stroke came on very sudden and she felt fine before her sudden ?worst migraine ever?. Luckily my brother was with her and took her to get help straight away before she became unconscious.

A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EP7534 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left second dose on 07Apr2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was not pregnant at time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included cetirizine, diphenhydramine, and phenylephrine. The patient historical vaccine includes bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6203), right arm first dose on 10Mar2021 for COVID-19 Immunization. On 07Apr2021 21:30, the patient felt sluggish directly after receiving the second dose. The patient began feeling discomfort in my lungs about 5 hours after the dose. The pain in my lung/chest area grew worse throughout the night to the point where it was difficult and extremely painful to breathe. The patient went to urgent care in the morning, and they ran an EKG, urine analysis, and chest X-ray: all with unknown results. They were concerned it could be something worse along with potential pneumonia, so they sent me to the emergency room. In the emergency room, I received a CT scan where they found multiple pulmonary embolisms (1 large one in my right and multiple in my left lung). The patient stated that she had just had my yearly physical the previous week (Apr2021), with no signs of any health issues. With that, the doctors believed my condition to be related to my 2nd dose, so I was admitted to the hospital. I had to stayed for 2 nights. I am now on blood thinners, other meds (pain medications), and require oxygen during sleep (O2 levels drop too low). I have been referred to lung and hematology specialists. Also, reported that patient experiencing significant shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain under the rib. This persisted for some time until she presented to the emergency department found to have segmental and subsegmental pulmonary embolus. Additionally, the patient experienced blood clots, chest pain, and shortness of breath due to extreme pain. Hypercoagulable work-up pending. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) with result of negative. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.

On April 23, patient had severe headache and vomiting, went to urgent care and was thought to have sinusitis and started on antibiotics and discharged home. On April 24th, patient became more drowsy with worsening headache and unresponsive. On April 25, she was taken to outside hospital and was noted to have abnormal brain MRI. She was transferred to our facility on April 26 after clinical worsening. Imaging revealed venous sinus thrombosis in deep cerebral veins and patient was intubated due to worsening mentation. Imaging also revealed a venous stroke with hemorrhage in her left thalamus and diffuse brain edema. Treatment includes extraventricular drain placement, anticoagulation (heparin), hypertonic saline to manage brain edema.  We also did extensive workup but no history of hormone therapy, contraceptive pills, underlying cancers. Tumor markers are negative. Hypercoagulable panel and rheumatologic panel are negative. Body imaging did reveal multiple uterine fibroids but no other cancer. Patient remains in the ICU, on the ventilator, heavily sedated for management of refractory intracranial hypertension.

This 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: ER8731 and expiry date unknown, Solution for injection), via an unknown route on 12Apr2021 at 15:05 (at the age of 60-years-old) at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included allergies, asthma, she had anaphylaxis in the past to allergies. (Unspecified allergens). The patient added that she had issues for about a year before her surgeon had to do a surgery on her throat. She added she was fortunate because her thyroid was in her airways 14 years ago and her body exploded with allergies and her throat closed a lot. When the doctor did the surgery, the doctor opened her throat up more so that if she had another anaphylaxis it would not result in death. Concomitant medications was not reported. On the same date, after the vaccination the patient had anaphylactic reaction. She stated that happened 62 minutes, it might have been 64 minutes and also stated a few minutes after 60 minutes. The vaccination facility released her after 30 minutes at 15:35 and when she realized something was happening it was 16:10 when the patient realized what it was that she was experiencing. The vaccine facility held onto her for 30 minutes, so she got the vaccine around 15:05 and they watched her for 30 minutes. She believed it was around 65 minutes later that she started noticing something was happening. The patient started like a flushed feeling. She does not know to describe it, it was like she had a drink or something like she felt flush or something over her system like a wave or something. It was like a strong drink or something. She does not drink a lot but it was like woohooo, a wave of something, and then she felt woozy. It was not too bad at first, she was at a bank drive through and she was not driving. The patient was going to pick something up so she stopped for 5 to 10 minutes. She was on the phone with a friend. She felt woozy. The patient asked her husband to buy diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Her husband called back when she got done at the bank, and she was only 10 minutes from her house. The patient had her EpiPen with her.

The patient stated that during her second dose last Thursday on 08Apr2021, she had an anaphylactic reaction and she couldn&#39;t breathe and long story short she had to go to the emergency room and she was given all kinds of epi shots and treatment and stuff and eventually she had to be kept in the ICU unit. She is not sure why she had such a severe reaction. She wanted to report that since then she has kept track every day on how she has been and she actually thought yesterday was the first day that she had felt better. She had extreme fatigue, lightheadedness, upper back pain and even a bloody nose on 10Apr2021 and also she couldn&#39;t see out of her left eye for about 2 hours. Then on 11Apr2021, she had severe pain at the back of her neck with a headache that lasted about 20 minutes and she couldn&#39;t move her neck. She had diarrhea and the only temperature she had was on 12Apr2021, it was only 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which isn&#39;t bad, but she had really bad diarrhea on 12Apr2021 and she took Imodium.

She woke up on 15Apr2021 and had no symptoms except her left and her right hips, both, had severe pain and she could barely walk and she couldn&#39;t bend at all. All she could do it take Tylenol and she used a heating pad and the pain was excruciating. She went to bed last night and she did sleep for maybe a total of 2 hours and when she woke up this morning her left hip seemed to be a little better but her right hip is still in severe pain and now her right knee joint is in severe pain too. Other than that, she has no other symptoms just the joint pain. She didn&#39;t know it would go on for this long, it has been over a week now and she just wanted to let us know about this. The patient was hospitalized for the event anaphylactic reaction from 08Apr2021 to 08Apr2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Blood typing: anti kell antibodies (doctor randomly decided to do a blood typing and they found anti kell antibodies in her blood) on an unspecified date, temperature: 99.5 degrees fahrenheit on 12Apr2021, temperature: 98.7 degrees fahrenheit on 13Apr2021.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Ex-piry Date: Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 on an unknown ana-tomical location as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Caller provided that her sister got the vaccine for COVID Prevention and because the patient has a handicapped, bedridden husband who has MS and is immune compromised, and it was to help prevent him from getting sick. Caller reported that the patient received the product during the daytime, all the women at the patient&#39;s job, which was home health payroll, everyone left to get the vaccine during work hours, like in the AM at around lunch time. Patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. Patient has not received any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the suspect product. Patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine, Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown, NDC number: Unknown, Expiry Date: Unknown) on 08Feb2021 with no reaction. She worked for a health agency and the whole office went and got it. Caller provided that her sister had a reaction the first time, on 03Apr2021, where her sister woke up with itching started in her hands and ended up migrating to her whole body. By morning patient&#39;s tongue had swelled up, couldn&#39;t swallow and her voice was scratchy, like the caller couldn&#39;t understand her sister&#39;s speech well. Caller provided that her sister went to the ER and said there was a whole team giving her urgent care, medication, and such. Caller reported that her sister said the ER didn&#39;t find anything in her bloodwork, and the caller did not think the patient was being treated for any other medical conditions, and caller did not think her sister is on any medications, but caller said to not quote her on that. Caller knew her sister had a weight problem, but she did not know if her sister needed blood pressure medication or anything. Caller reported her sister said that the bloodwork from the ER did not find any-thing, and the patient was not admitted to the hospital. Caller reported that at this time, her sister&#39;s adverse events were no longer ongoing as her sister was given Steroids, like Prednisone, Benadryl and Famotidine, and she took those products as recommended by the doctor. Caller did not know the end date of her sister&#39;s events; all she knew was that the reaction initially started on 03Apr2021. Caller stated that her sister was allergic to nothing, and she has never had incidences of itching like that, where the itching was so bad that she was stripping down and the patient&#39;s daughter was patting the patient down with witch hazel. Caller stated that ER released the patient and gave her some medications and such. Caller stated that a day or so later, there was a second round of reaction: the right side of the patient&#39;s face swelled up and numb and her lips were numb, like when people have a dental procedure. Lips were numb for a while. Upon completion of the medications she was given, the reactions stopped. Patient regularly saw the family doctor. She would go back to see her Doctor on Thursday. HCP Information was unknown to the caller, but caller stated that her sister had been recommended to go to her PCP and get an Epi Pen. Caller stated that knock on wood, so far, her sister was holding her own, and it had not happened again. Caller stated that she was reporting the data that her sister gave to her after having the Pfizer vaccination. Caller stated the patient had an anaphylactic reaction twice that caused her to go to the emergency room. No relevant tests were done. Caller stated that she had the dates that she had her shots and where she had her shot at. Caller stated somebody called and reported it already. Caller stated she was trying to press three but never could figure out which prompts was. Caller stated they said if she called this number, they would tell her at the medical information department if this occurrence has happened to other people, like statistics. Caller stated they tried to call this number, but it was too long of a wait. Caller stated that she did not have the vaccination card, she never asked for them. Caller does not have card with her at time of call for LOT, NDC, Expiry date. Caller stated that she knew that all the COVID vaccines are just in the Emergency Use Authorization stage and in clinical trials, but caller really thought that all manufacturers should be advertising that they would like feedback from patients. Caller has not heard anything from any of the manufacturers saying that people are welcome to reach out and report side effects. Caller states that she only knew to call because she used to be a Home Health Worker, and she thought this is an important data. Caller has never seen on any of her 19 TV channels about calling to report. Caller stated that the girl who first answered her call, read a clinical data sheet about joint pain being seen in 23% of patient&#39;s and not knowing a percentage for anaphylactic reactions, caller was wondering if this was true. Caller verified that she just wanted to ask basically that patient was not alone, if other people might have had that happen too. Caller stated that she tried to call, and it would ask another question and it would say press 1 or 2, then it would ask other questions and it would say press 1 or 2, she never got an option 3. Caller asked: how much percentage, has anyone reported this side effects weeks after the second dose. Caller was wondering if this reaction could have been from the vaccine. Investigation Assessment: No. The outcome of the events were unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 60-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Mar2021 at 14:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoporosis at least 10 years, terrible nausea, mild case of covid from Nov2020 to an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took alendronate from 2008 to an unknown date and experienced very sick, nausea, diarrhoea and zoledronic acid (RECLAST) from Dec2017 and experienced nausea and vomiting. On 27Mar2021 at 2:00, the patient experienced deathly sick, fainted, fracture of ankle/two fractures on her ankle, severely nauseous, vomiting, and diarrhea. On an unknown date, the patient experienced dvt blood clot, ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable/discomfort, the nights are the worst for the pain, pulse ox was low, and d-dimer was very high. The event, deathly sick, was life-threatening. The clinical course was as follows: the patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 26Mar2021 at 14:00 in the afternoon in her left arm. Twelve hours after the first dose, later in the night about 02:00 AM she woke up deathly sick; and severely nauseous. She remembered she was going to the bathroom then she must have fainted because they were taking her to the hospital. She went to the ER and they found she had a fractured ankle. She was not admitted to the hospital. She was in the ER from about 03:00 AM to noon the next day. There must have been something in there; she knew there must be something in the vaccine because of her reaction. Adds a few years ago, something like this happened before. She had osteoporosis and had similar reactions with other products she had tried for osteoporosis; she had terrible nausea. The other products she tried included: in 2008 she took alendronate, it made her very sick but not as severe as this time, she never fainted. She had nausea and diarrhea. Then in Dec2017 she had zoledronic acid. She went for an infusion at the hospital then went shopping, and was fine until the early morning, when she woke up with nausea and vomiting. In the ambulance, they gave her ondasetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea so the vomiting stopped. With regard to her ankle, first they thought it was a DVT blood clot. They did the xray and saw actually two fractures on her ankle but she does not need surgery. She saw the orthopedic doctor the other day and he said her ankle was healing but she still will have no weight bearing for 6 weeks and she was in a boot. Adds her ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable. She hated to take medications and they gave her oxy but she didn&#39;t want to take it. She was taking ibuprofen but that messed up her stomach. The nights are the worst for the pain and discomfort. Doctor at the hospital and primary care agreed she should not have the second dose. She did have mild case of COVID in Nov2020 and they are hoping she had antibodies from the infection and the first dose. Her primary care doctor was reviewing the blood work she had done at the hospital and told her they were surprised the hospital didn&#39;t admit her for observation because her pulse ox was low and there was another test that she was questioning because the d-dimer was very high. They did a chest x ray with unknown results. The doctor was questioning why they didn&#39;t do something else to rule out a blood clot. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events, deathly sick, DVT blood clot, fainted, fracture of ankle/two fractures on her ankle, severely nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea, ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable/discomfort, nights were the worst for the pain, pulse ox was low, and d-dimer was very high. The clinical outcome of the events, deathly sick, fainted, severely nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea, was recovered on 27Mar2021. The clinical outcome of the events, DVT blood clot and nights were the worst for the pain, pulse ox was low, and d-dimer was very high, was unknown. The clinical outcome of the event, fracture of ankle/two fractures on her ankle, was recovering. The clinical outcome of the event, ankle was still swollen and uncomfortable/discomfort, was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Congestive heart failure; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (Patient). A 60-years-old female patient received second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 30Mar2021 11:00 (at the age of 60-years-old) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, cardiac disorder from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: unknown) on 10Mar2020 at 11:00 PM in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shortness of breath. The patient experienced congestive heart failure on Jun2021. The events assessed as serious (medically significant). Call was from two sisters, a 57 year old female and a 60 year old female. One received her Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 22Jun2021 and started experiencing shortness of breath and dyspnea. The other sister received the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021 and starting experiencing shortness of breath as well but attributed to her history of atrial fibrillation initially. Both are wondering if anyone else was having these complaints and if there are any recommendations for the complaints. Patient mentioned while providing family history, her sister had the COVID 19 vaccination and also had shortness of breath. Adds her sister got her vaccination in Mar2021 but she does not had her card with her. She also had shortness of breath and was still having it. She did not put two and two and together until her sister had it. This was a clone report was created to document the sister&#39;s experience. Patient adds the shortness of breath that started in Mar2021. States she had previously been off work for a year with A-Fib but she was doing really well, she had started walking around the block and everything. Reports she was unsure of exactly when she noticed the shortness of breath. She went from the car to the store and she was short of breath so she went to the emergency room to get it checked but everything was good. Mentions she was also diagnosed with congestive heart failure about a month ago. After she went to the emergency room she just went back and forth to her doctors. The lung doctor said she was okay and the heart doctor, too. She kept going to the doctor because it did not dawn on her that the shortness of breath might be related to the vaccination until her sister got her vaccination and had the shortness of breath. Now she believes she noticed the shortness of breath after the first dose. Mentions she has the emergency room records and her vaccination card at home to verify her information. Adds she was talking to a guy at the bus station and he had shortness of breath too. She does not know this person and declined to report regarding the guy at the bus station. Patient visited Emergency Room, but not admitted. Patient visited physician Office. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: good, chest x-ray: good, electrocardiogram: good on More information available (Y/N): No. The outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

                                                New onset eczema- Filed earlier report about being bitten by fire ants two weeks after second covid shot and having anaphylactic reaction with no prior history of insect bite allergies and have been bitten alot including the harvester ant. Now have epipen. Then started fire ant shots in June and developed butt tingling/numbness and muscle and body aches after 2nd fire ant shot. By third shot on on July 1st, I had fatigue, extreme musculoskeletal pain and developed a rash. It was really scary so went to the allergist who referred me to my GP.  She thinks it is serum sickness.  Saw the dermatologist today about the rash and it started about 3 to 4 days after the third fire ant shot. I have never had eczema in my life either. After three weeks from July 1st, am starting to feel better. Not sure if serum sickness caused by molecular mimicry hypersensitive immune syndrome caused by Covid vaccine or not, but there are a lot of immune mediated things happening to me in less than 3 months.  My brother developed pericarditis after the second Pfizer shot and I told him to file a VAERS as well.

                                                pneumonia; loss of consciousness; difficulty in breathing; feeling weak; diarrhea; Arm fracture; Fall; This is a solicited report received from a contactable consumer (patient) based on the information received by Pfizer. (MFR Control No. # 21K-163-3955081-00).  A 60-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 26Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation; adalimumab (HUMIRA 40MG/0.4ML, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen), subcutaneous from 03Apr2020 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to Mar2021, at Citrate Free (40 mg,1 in 2 wk), subcutaneous from Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) and ongoing, at 40 mg for Ulcerative Colitis. Medical history included tobacco user: one pack of cigrette per day (Started 1978), abstains from alcohol.  Concomitant medications included tizanidine; carvedilol (COREG); pregabalin; atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; apixaban (ELIQUIS).  The patient previously took hydrocodone.  The patient experienced loss of consciousness on May2021 with outcome of recovered on May2021, pneumonia on 05May2021 with outcome of recovered in 2021, feeling weak on 27Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, difficulty in breathing on 27Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, diarrhea on Mar2021 with outcome of recovered in 2021, arm fracture on 27Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, fall on 27Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. Clinical course: In 2021, the patient experienced chest tube had been drained and removed. On 27Feb2021, the patient experienced broken right arm in two different places and fell. In Mar2021, the patient experienced diarrhea. in May2021, the patient experienced loss of consciousness. on 05May 2021, the patient experienced pneumonia. in May 2021, the loss of consciousness resolved. in 2021, the pneumonia and diarrhea resolved. Covid-19 vaccine was also considered suspect. the patient shared that she fell in 27Feb2021 and broke her right arm so she went to the emergency room. Her x-ray revealed that she broke her arm in two different places. she was then asked to meet with an orthopedic surgeon and was scheduled for an out-patient procedure to repair her broken arm with pins and plates on the second week of Mar2021. she was sent home and was given hydrocodone for pain. she also added that the physician placed her humira on hold two weeks prior and after the procedure. because of humira was placed on hold, she experienced diarrhea for a week until it resolved. she received her first dose of her covid-19 vaccine in 26Apr2021. she noticed that she started feeling weak and had difficulty in breathing the next morning. she was rushed to the hospital in 05May2021 because her weakness and difficulty of breathing worsened. a series of unrecalled tests had been performed including chest x-ray which showed that she had pneumonia. she was then admitted and was hooked up to a machine because she had difficulty in breathing. she added that she could not recall any other treatments or diagnostic tests that was done to her because she was unconscious for three weeks and was monitored in the intensive care unit. she added that her chest tube had been drained and removed the day she got released in the hospital. she was sent home in 25May2021. alternative etiology of pneumonia, weakness, loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing were reported as covid-19 vaccine.it was unknown if patient was enrolled in a covid-19 vaccine trial. The action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable, for adalimumab was unknown.    Causality for humira 40mg/0.4ml(adalimumab)-the reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of loss of consciousness, broken right arm in two different places, pneumonia, fell and diarrhea with humira 40mg/0.4ml(adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility. the reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of chest tube had been drained and removed was not provided. Programs opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of loss of consciousness, broken right arm in two different places, chest tube had been drained and removed, pneumonia, fell and diarrhea are related to humira 40mg/0.4ml(adalimumab).   COVID-19 VACCINE (COVID-19 VACCINE)(Injection) (COVID-19 VACCINE), Causality: Loss of consciousness-Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Probable; Arm fracture-Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Not Related; Pneumonia-Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Probable; Fall-Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Not Related; Diarrhea-Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Not Related.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events (feeling weak, difficulty in breathing) with the suspect products was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the plausible temporal relation, the association between the events of loss of consciousness, pneumonia, asthenia and dyspnoea and the suspect product of BNT162B2 cannot be completely ruled out. The confounding factor for the event of pneumonia is the co-suspect drug Humira  Due to implausible temporal association, the events of diarrhoea, arm fracture and fall are assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

The patient previously took NSAIDs and voriconazole and experienced drug allergies. It was reported that the patient presented to emergency department (ED) on 04Feb2021 with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, nausea and diarrhea for past week since receiving since receiving COVID-19 vaccine. Full viral panel including COVID-19 was not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 08Feb2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 13Feb2021. Acute pupil exam changes in the early am hours of 15Feb2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. The events were all serious. The patient outcome of the events was fatal. The patient died on 15Feb2021.

A 61-years-old female patient received second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number:EL3302), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Feb2021 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation in hospital. Medical history included hypothyroid. Patient is not pregnant. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine, trazodone, famotidine (PEPCID), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12). The patient previously took codeine and experienced drug hypersensitivity. Historical vaccination included BNT162B2(lot number:EL3248) on 12Jan2021, in left arm, first dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. The patient stated I don&#39;t know if it was a result of the Covid shot. But I don&#39;t have any comorbidities and I had a stroke on to four which was two days after the shot on 04Feb2021 09:30 with outcome of recovering (as reported). AE result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization (2 days), disability or permanent damage. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab, Covid test result: negative.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Despite insufficient clinical information provided, by close temporal relationship and absence of factors which may provide an alternative cause, the company deems there is a reasonable possibility that the reported stroke is related to the suspect drug Comirnaty.

                                                I am retired handicap-MS.  I was doing light housework.  I started getting pain in right lung,  over course of 2  hours  pain became very severe.  Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

                                                AFib; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A non-pregnant 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 15Mar2021 at 14:00 (02:00 PM), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. One week after the vaccine on 22Mar2021 at 09:00 AM, the patient had an atrial fibrillation (Afib) event. On 22Mar2021, the patient went to the emergency room (ER) or department or urgent care and ran tests including electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, and blood work which were all normal. Now, the patient had to go to a cardiologist for further understanding of the reason for AFib event. No treatment was given for the event. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the event.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I experienced a slight headache  sore arm and elevated blood pressure after the shot. My blood pressure is usually very well controlled. On Monday the 29th, at about 3:30 pm, I started to slur my words. At first we blamed it on the Novocaiine earlier in the day, but I had been talking fine after it and had had it many, many times before and it was worn off. We called my doctor&#39;s office after my right arm and leg became very heavy and awkward. They told me to go to the nearest hospital. When I got there, I presented ass a full stroke. I was very hard to understand and my mouth drooped and I had very little use of my right arm and leg. They ran tests, but could not give me the medication because I was already on Eliquis. They thought they saw a small clot very high up. I was hospitalized over the next four days and improved my speech dramatically after a bad headache on March 30. The doctors go back and forth to whether it was a Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is what my paperwork says and a complex migraine. I do not experience migraines or anything like this ever before.  I did not have a real headache on the 29th. Since my symptoms, right arm and leg difficulties are still here, my Doctor believes it was a stroke. I have an appointment with a Neurologist and I have to have another MRI. I am going to Physical Therapy. My Doctor told me to fill this out, she thinks it may be from the vaccine.

                                                Six days after my 2nd vaccine I had an anaphylaxis reaction.  Out of the blue while I was driving my face started to burn like acid was rubbed on it. It got really hot and turned very bright red. Then my lips began to feel like they had been sunburned badly. Then my forearms both started burning and also turned bright red. I was very anxious. Had two bouts of diarrhea. All this occurred within about a 20 minute time-frame.  I chewed up 4 children&#39;s Benadryl (50mg) and the redness, burning and anxiousness subsided mostly. My heart rat was still over 100 bpm even after  6 hours. (Usually my HR is 68-70 bpm). I slept for 12 hours and the next day seemed fine.  This has occurred two more times since that first time. The 2nd reaction being 5 days after that first one and the 3rd reaction being 5 days after that. Same reaction, same treatment and same outcome.

It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

She was taken to Hospital where they started treating her for an infection but her fever went up over 103F so they ventilated her to try to control the fever. They did blood tests during that time and got the infections disease unit trying to figure out what was causing her symptoms.  Doctors diagnosed sepsis.  They continued to do blood test and cultures but could not determine the cause. They did MRIs as follow-ups because she was not responding. The fever never went down.  She was awake for a few days (ventilator still in) and then started getting worse again.  This is about 1.5 weeks post vaccination.  They did an MRI and found a bleed on her brain and the infection had spread to her heart valves.  Symptoms began within hours of vaccination.  She was take to the hospital the morning after the vaccine and never came home.  Patient died after 2 weeks in the ICU.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient is a 56 y.o. female who presented to the Emergency Department due to chest pain. She has experienced this pain each evening for the past 3 evenings, and states that it starts in her right arm then migrates through her shoulder and across to her chest. The pain can last for anywhere from 5 minutes to 4 hours. This has come on at rest, but in the setting increased personal life stressors as well as uncontrolled hypertension. She states that she is normally on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, but ran out of this medication about a week ago. When she checked her blood pressure at home it was in the 230s/120s, therefore she presented to the emergency department locally. Her medical comorbidities are notable for poorly controlled hypertension, mixed hyperlipidemia that is untreated, current tobacco use (1-2 packs per day for 40 years), and medically complicated obesity. In the emergency department  she was found to have mild polycythemia with hemoglobin of 15.2 and leukocytosis of 13.7. INR, D-dimer, and BMP were normal.  High sensitivity troponin T was found to be 770 ng/L. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with T-wave inversion in aVL that was not present on 08/25/2004. Chest x-ray was largely unremarkable. Her chest pain resolved, but given the elevated troponin ECG changes she was treated for NSTEMI with heparin infusion, and loaded with aspirin and clopidogrel and directly admitted to the Hospital Cardiology service.  Upon arrival she remained free of chest pain but continued to have significant hypertension. I have reviewed and updated the following: Past Medical History, Family History, Social History, and Allergies. Current Outpatient Medications on File Prior to Encounter:  hydrochlorothiazide (HYDRODIURIL) 25 mg tablet, Take 1 tablet (25 mg total) by mouth daily., Past Week at Unknown time; Lorazepam (ATIVAN) 0.5 mg tablet, Take 0.5 mg by mouth daily as needed for anxiety., More than a month at Unknown time. REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Pertinent items are noted in HPI; all other review of systems was negative. OBJECTIVE  VITAL SIGNS Temperature: [36.8 °C-36.9 °C] 36.9 °C; Heart Rate:  [83-117] 83; Resp Rate:  [20-26] 22; Blood Pressure: (164-195)/(81-129) 164/106; SpO2:[92 %-97 %] 95 %;Weight:  [104 kg-106 kg] 104 kg; Pulse Rate:  [90-109] 94. PHYSICAL EXAM General: Alert, oriented, no acute distress; HEENT: Mucous membranes moist, JVP difficult to assess due to body habitus; CV: Regular rate and rhythm without murmur; Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally; Abdomen: Obese, soft, nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds; Extremities: No peripheral edema appreciated; Neuro: No focal deficits appreciated. DIAGNOSTICS I have reviewed labs and imaging from the past 24 hours. ASSESSMENT / PLAN Patient is a 56 y.o. female who was directly admitted to the Cardiology Service from  Emergency Department due to NSTEMI and poorly controlled hypertension. She also has untreated mixed hyperlipidemia and is a current smoker. We will continue to trend troponins and treat NSTEMI was heparin infusion, aspirin, and clopidogrel. I will start a statin and initiate low-dose lisinopril and carvedilol for blood pressure control with plans to up titrate as tolerated. I will update a lipid panel in checked for diabetes. I will obtain a TTE in the morning and keep her NPO for probable coronary angiogram pending negative COVID swab. #1 Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; #2 Poorly controlled systemic hypertension; #3 Mixed hyperlipidemia, previously untreated; #4 Medically complicated obesity (BMI 38-trend troponin- loaded with aspirin and clopidogrel- Aspirin 81 mg daily- clopidogrel 75 mg daily- moderate intensity heparin infusion- rosuvastatin 20 mg daily- lisinopril 2.5 mg daily, up titrate as tolerated- carvedilol 6.25 mg twice daily, up titrate as tolerated- holding home hydrochlorothiazide in lieu of lisinopril and carvedilol- lipid panel  - hemoglobin A1c- TTE- NPO for probable angiogram (not-ordered)- cardiac rehab consult ordered;#5 Abuse Tobacco Smoking- nicotine patch- nicotine inhaler as needed- nicotine cessation consult; #6 Anxiety She is prescribed lorazepam 0.5 mg which she takes when she has a panic attack which only occurs a couple times per year.

SUBJECTIVE HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS Patient is a very pleasant 56-year-old female who is owner of multiple nursing facilities who presented with chest pain and hypertensive emergency. She ran out of her hydrochlorothiazide last week, was fairly busy managing all her nursing homes with COVID pandemic and vaccination program. She was having intermittent chest pain, chest pressure radiating to the right arm. In this setting she checked her blood pressure, and it was noted to be 240 systolic over 140 diastolic. In this setting was sent to the ER and subsequently sent here. Initial troponin was 770. Subsequently, it went up to 1923. Delta was 862. ECG showed sinus rhythm with clear ST depression in the inferolateral leads. Patient currently is chest pain-free. She was initiated on carvedilol and restarted her home hydrochlorothiazide. Blood pressure is better. She had a good night&#39;s sleep. OBJECTIVE  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION; Vital Signs: Noted.; General: Alert and oriented x3. Cardiac: S1, S2 normal.; Lungs: Clear.; Abdomen: Soft.; Extremities: No edema of feet.; Vessels: Peripheral pulses well-felt.; DIAGNOSTICS Creatinine is 0.7.  Bicarb is 30. ASSESSMENT / PLAN Patient, is a 56-year-old female with obesity, hypertension, smoking, presented with hypertensive emergency. Blood pressure is better controlled now. She did have clear ST-T changes with troponin elevation, and we will treat it as NSTEMI at this point. Certainly, this can be demand ischemia in setting of hypertensive emergency, but she has multiple risk factors which would warrant coronary artery disease evaluation. We will plan for an angiogram today. We will get an echo today. Post that, we will reassess and see how things go. It appears that this was in setting of medication noncompliance. However, if this happens again, we may also look for other secondary causes of hypertension, especially with the fact that her bicarbonate was 30. All her questions were answered. DIAGNOSES: #1 Hypertensive emergency; #2 NSTEMI; #3 Obesity. M.B.B.S. DD: 03/30/2021 08:54:32 CT; DT: 03/30/2021 09:13:15 CT; Job ID:  914158020/mjb.

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS For appointment details refer to your Patient Appointment Guide. HOSPITAL COURSE  Admission Weight: 104 kg; Dismissal Weight: 103 kg; BMI: Body mass index is 37.82 kg/m².Patient is a 56 y.o. female who presented to the Emergency Department due to chest pain. She has experienced this pain each evening for the past 3 evenings, and states that it starts in her right arm then migrates through her shoulder and across to her chest. The pain can last for anywhere from 5 minutes to 4 hours. This has come on at rest, but in the setting increased personal life stressors as well as uncontrolled hypertension. She states that she is normally on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, but ran out of this medication about a week ago. When she checked her blood pressure at home it was in the 230s/120s, therefore she presented to the emergency department locally. Her medical comorbidities are notable for poorly controlled hypertension, mixed hyperlipidemia that is untreated, current tobacco use (1-2 packs per day for 40 years), and medically complicated obesity(BMI 38.19 kg/m2). Intravenous heparin was initiated for the heparin nomogram. She was Plavix loaded and received aspirin.  Carvedilol, lisinopril and Rosuvastatin were initiated. She proceeded to coronary angiogram with drug-eluting stent to the left distal circumflex artery. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated ejection fraction 63%. Nicotine dependence was consulted and provided cessation information and prescriptions for nicotine replacement therapy.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Was not feeling well; Warm sensation in chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EJ 1685), intramuscular, on 21Dec2020 at 09:30 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine location was left arm.  The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 62-years-old. The patient received also varicella zoster vaccine RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) on 19Nov2020. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included omeprazole, colestyramine (QUESTRAN), and vitamins. On 22Dec2020, the patient was not feeling well intermittently starting the day after the injection with warm sensation in chest that would go away until 31Dec2020 when the warm sensation of chest would not go away.

                                                Slight headache that day (4/1).  The next day (4/2), weakness in left leg and arm. On 4/3 went to ER, admitted to NeuroScience ICU. Diagnosed with small blood clot and small bleed in brain--- dural venous sinus thrombosis. The neurology team said this was very unusual and very rare in this part of brain--where the blood flows back to the heart from the brain. They did alot of tests on every part of my body looking for the cause and found nothing. They think it was vacine induced and repoted it to the CDC. Left leg and arm weakness remains with no changes yet. Now taking blood thinner and doing physical therapy

                                                Resident was given the vaccine on 4/8/21.  She had a stroke/heart attack when she was being taken to the bathroom on 4/13/21 around 8:30pm.  She was admitted to the hospital and at this time I believe she is still hospitalized.  We were unsure if this was related to the vaccine or her general health condition as she is recently started dialysis and they discovered a pituitary cancer when doing a scan for the stroke on 4/13/21 or 4/14/21.  We talked with our Medical Director and thought it would be best to report this since it happened shortly after her first vaccine dose.

On March 18th, 2021 I had a spontaneous anaphylactic reaction requiring the use of Benadryl and an inhaler. 40 minutes after second injection (Apr. 2nd, 2021) my face became bright red - which is usually the beginnings of an allergic or non-tolerant reaction to something to which I&#39;ve come in contact.  A Benadryl dose resolved this reaction within 20 minutes. On April 10th I had a spontaneous anaphylactic reaction requiring the use of Benadryl. 12 Days after second dose I noticed my tongue feeling raw and started feeling a UTI beginning.  By 14 days after second dose I had approximately 14 pea sized lumps on the back and back sides of my tongue, the gums of my teeth were very swollen and sore. The roots of my teeth ached terribly, chewing was very difficult.  My ears were both very itchy deep within.  I was seen my my physician on  April 20th, 2021 and diagnosed with Candida Overgrowth.

A non-pregnant 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 31Mar2021 at 01:00 PM (13:00), as first dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), lymphedema (previously resolved), mild asthma, osteoporosis, herniated discs, allergies, and menopause. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included unspecified vitamins. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks (however, it was also reported that other vaccine was administered in same date, 31Mar2021; pending clarification). The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. On 03Apr2021 at 02:00 AM, the patient experienced intermittent long-lasting palpitations, lymph discomfort in one leg for which they went to check if it was blood clot. On 03Apr2021 at 02:00 AM, the patient also had severe pain of bones in chest, joint pains, severe shooting intermittent head pain, cold sweat, felt like she was going to faint, COVID arm popped out (nite 8; as reported), severe nerve pain behind ear same side as vaccine, exacerbated back pain, and bad menstrual cramps for 2 mornings 11 years post-menopause. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office or clinic visit. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The events were considered non-serious. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient had not recovered from the events.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                She got her vaccine in the left arm, and felt fine.  She went shopping in the store and noticed that she was short winded when she was leaving, but felt that it was possibly asthma and left.   She had a temperature between 102 and 103 for a couple of days and having fever and chills as well.  She continued with the shortness windedness, and had company and on 5/9/21 they left and she started having severe pain, felt like it was either on the right side kidney or the lung, and was spasming horribly and knocking her down with the pain.  She went to the ER and they did a CAT Scan thinking it was kidney stones, but told her that she had three blood clots in her lungs, lower base right and lower base left and mid right and part of her lung has apparently died due to this.  They put her on blood thinners, Xarelto.   She was admitted on 5/10 early morning and released on 5/12/21.  The doctor in the hospital said that it did not make sense that she had blood clots in her lungs, but nothing in her legs.  She told her that she was short winded, and he told her to report her reaction.  Since being home she has been coughing a lot due to possibly the blood clots.  She was told that she will be on the Xarelto for a very long time.  She was also informed that she had lymph node enlargement as well.

Thought it could be muscular from heavy lifting over the weekend.  Self treated with steroids for 2 days, and the problem resolved.  I did not seek medical care.   On May 10 and May 11, the pain returned.  This time I knew it was not muscular so sought medical treatment.   After describing to my physicians office I was advised to go to the ER.

                                                Few days after receiving the vaccine around 4/25, my mother complained to me that she was feeling very weak and tired, she was unable to hold anything down. She also had a rash. She became weaker and weaker so suddenly and unable to even drink protein drinks.  She finally went to the ER on 5/4 because she could barely walk, unable to eat anything and was short of breath.  They diagnosed her with pneumonia and a possible lung mass. She was diagnosed simultaneously 10 days later with small cell lung cancer however she had no symptoms prior. She received first dose chemo on 5/20/21 and had a reaction to the chemo that the doctor stated was very rare. They then had to try a different type of chemo for second dose 2 days later. She progressively got worse suddenly after chemo dose #3 and was in renal failure the day following chemo completion. She died on 5/27/2021. Her primary death diagnosis was sepsis, pneumonia and small cell lung cancer. I am reporting this for my mother because the vaccine has not been tested on cancer or chemo patients. It can and should not be regarded as coincidental. It needs to be tracked in case there are future reports regarding cancer patients.

Found to have STEMI; trop &gt;100 with trending over past 24 hours. Has likely significant anoxic injury, prognosis is grim. Because apparent MI occurred within the original Pfizer trial study period of 14 weeks, and also at our institution we have had 2 other cases of early age and unexpected fatal MI&#39;s s/p vaccine, decision made to report this case as potential vaccine adverse reaction.

                                                Immediately following the second dose, I had a lot of trouble with insomnia and nightmares that continued for almost 3 weeks. The nightmares stopped and even tho I am 9 years POST menopausal, I began bleeding again on April 28. Basically, it has only stopped for 3-4 days at a time in between. And I have been bleeding almost  constantly ever since except for 10 days.  I have had a uterine biopsy  at Hospital. And Ultrasounds and there are no issues other than my uterine tissue is thicker than it should be.  My joints are painful and enlarged too. That began at the beginning of May.  I have had xrays and have been treated with steroids to get the tissue under control. I also am now experiencing Night Sweats and Hot flashes. Mayo doctors believe I need a hysterectomy or D&amp;C to stop the bleeding issue.

This nurse reported different events for different vaccine doses for the same patient. This is one of the two reports.  A 62-years-old female patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jun2021 at 15:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW1071) single; and dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 19May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0183) single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken for an unspecified indication from Jun2021 to 09Jun2021. It was reported that with the first Pfizer vaccine dose on 19May2021, she developed chills, had severe headache, feeling of ants crawling in her throat, and shooting pain in the calves and left calf shot down to the big toe, it was shooting pain, but both calves were involved. The patient experienced rash on 08Jun2021; anaphylactic reaction on 09Jun2021; severe headache, &#39;lymphadenopathy&#39;, &#39;neck pain&#39;, &#39;ear discomfort&#39;, &#39;swelling&#39;, &#39;ocular discomfort&#39; on 09Jun2021 at 15:00; and bad flu in 2021. After what the patient experienced with the first vaccine dose, she was indicated to take Benadryl thirty minutes before the second vaccine. She was however told that it could mask potential side effects. Due to the masking potential, she stopped taking it and reported adverse events. The patient reported lymphadenopathy, headache, neck pain, feeling of the eye ball outward which lasted 1-4 days, and ear burning in ear drums. The patient stated that these (unspecified) stopped on Sunday. Stated that the headache was most severe. Also stated that &#34;I thought a severe allergic reaction was like anaphylaxis&#34;. The patient was at another doctor&#39;s office and was indicated that she could also have had COVID that&#39;s why she had a severe allergic reaction. According to her, she had never been mask less, and was double masking. She works from home. Second vaccination was two weeks post. She could have possibly gotten it, bad flu, that would be the only time she could have. The patient had called on 09Jun2021 as she got her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 08Jun2021 and someone was supposed to call her back from the department, whoever handled Adverse Events, but no one ever returned the call or sent an email. She took the first Pfizer vaccine on 19May2021 and had severe headache, feeling of ants crawling in her throat, shooting pain in calves and left calf shot down to the big toe, it was shooting pain, but both calves were involved, and she had spoken to an employee health nurse, who suggested she take a Benadryl 30 minutes before the second vaccine. As they were concerned about the crawling in her throat, they feared anaphylactic reaction to the second, as people said the second was worse, and she called her doctor to confirm, who was also in agreement for her to take it. Her doctor said to take it and take it every 4-6 hours for the first 24 hours, and she had the vaccine on the 8th at around 3PM, and had a little reaction on her left forearm, of a rash. It lasted about 10 minutes and went away. At the vaccine site, they let her go, and she took the Benadryl twice more, her last dose was at 0130. On 09Jun2021, she called Pfizer, who said they don&#39;t recommend to take Benadryl, that it could be masking potential side effects that can lead to anaphylaxis, so she stopped taking her last dose at 0130, and at 3PM on the 9th, she had severe headache, neck pain, it appeared her neck was swollen, stated it was probably lymph nodes that were swollen to the back and side, she had burning in her eardrums, both ears, and she felt like the back of her eyeballs were poking, like to the front, like they would pop out of her eye (she thought that was the most predominant symptoms she had). It lasted for 3 days. She spoke to someone on 09Jun2021 in the morning. and stopped taking Benadryl, and they said she would get a call from Pfizer and she thought she would report those side effects after the second dose because they happened in the afternoon, and now she has a day off from work, so she thought to call and say what happened with the second dose. The patient stated that she works from home, but she was not clinical. Confirmed it was the COVID 19 Pfizer vaccine that she received. The severe headache started after 3PM on 09Jun 2021, it was not ongoing and it went away on Sunday, which the reporter provided as &#34;12Jun2021&#34; The patient stated that she has had intermittent headaches ever since, so has recovered with lasting effects, they are not as severe as the original, but she had some lasting effects. The patient was inquiring if she should receive a booster. According to the patient, they were talking about the potential of having to give boosters, and with everything she had been through with the first two (the second was worse than the first), she was ambivalent about getting the booster. Outcome of the event &#39;rash&#39; was recovered on 08Jun2021; for &#39;lymphadenopathy&#39;, &#39;swelling&#39;, and &#39;ocular discomfort&#39; was recovered on 10Jun2021; for &#39;neck pain&#39; and &#39;ear discomfort&#39; was recovered on 11Jun2021; for &#39;headache&#39; was recovered with sequela on 12Jun2021; while for the other events was unknown. Seriousness criteria for the severe neck pain was reported as disabling; for the &#34;burning in eardrums, both ears&#34; was not serious; while for the initial headache, to the 12th was severely debilitating, she couldn&#39;t do anything, it was horrible, but the lasting effects were tolerable, she took Tylenol and it resolved. For the severe neck pain that ended in the morning and was no longer present (appeared neck was swollen: ended in the evening) seriousness was reported as just mild discomfort, not disabling. For the burning in eardrums that started in the evening, at hour of sleep, at night, was bilateral, burning, inner ear pain, and it was intermittent, and lasted until 11Jun2021, and she went to the ear doctor today, who said her eardrums were ok, but she was concerned, so this was reported as not serious. For the eyeballs poking that happened at the same time as burning eardrums, only at hour of sleep at night, and woke up on the 10th and it was gone, seriousness was reported that since it was intermittent, not disabling, but was annoying. Also stated that it was frightening, but she was worried if it continued, she would go to the eye doctor, but it went away. Causality for the events was reported as follows: severe headache: Yes (Related), severe neck pain: Yes (Related), &#34;appeared neck was swollen, probably lymph nodes, swollen to the back and side&#34;: Yes (Related), burning in eardrums, both ears: Yes (Related), and &#34;felt like the back of her eyeballs were poking, like to the front, like they would pop out of her eye&#34;: Yes (Related).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021677809 Same patient, same product, different events/vaccine dose

She already has known CAD and risk factors for CVD.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that the vaccine was an indirect cause of the event.  Since the vaccine provoked an immune response, as it was supposed to, it is possible that this inflammation may have set up a metabolic predisposition that may have contributed to the event, which was 12 days later.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

Patient previously took Tylenol for sinus headache and does not have an effect on her. After the first dose of the vaccine the patient reported that she was extremely tired on 11Mar2021. She was completely nauseated most of the day on the second day. On Saturday, she was extremely nauseated (12Mar2021) with vomiting and major diarrhea on 13Mar2021. By 4 PM that afternoon (12Mar2021), she could not function because she was so cold; she felt like she was in a really bad dream and couldn&#39;t wake up. She called on 13Mar2021, her blood pressure was so low-they got 58 for the top number, they were unable to pull up bottom number at that point. patient reported that when the ambulance arrived, they described her face as extremely pale on 13Mar2021; her major complaint was that she was so cold- she has never been that cold in her life. When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

                                                has possible atrial fibrillation; Arm would get hurt; her arm felt like a bruise; irregular heart rates; She&#39;ll have  a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night.; When probing for specific event information she reports it&#39;s kind of like she coughs a little more and she is a little more short of breath and it&#39;s happening more often; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 63 years, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 04:06 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn&#39;t remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn&#39;t take any types of &#34;cillins&#34; medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she&#39;s noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn&#39;t feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it&#39;s going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she&#39;s not even doing anything. She hasn&#39;t even worked out yet. She doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. Medications don&#39;t work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She&#39;s been reporting online. Clarified she&#39;s reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She&#39;s been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband&#39;s cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She&#39;s also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband&#39;s heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn&#39;t messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she&#39;s standing completely still. Then she&#39;ll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she&#39;s been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it&#39;s going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she&#39;s never had her heartrate go down that far, it&#39;s really really weird. She thinks maybe she&#39;ll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s. Now the device says possible atrial fibrillation. It was further reported that she received the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm because she has bursitis in her right. If she hit her arm the second day after the Covid 19 vaccine, her arm would hurt. Her arm felt better the next day. She clarifies, on Sunday, 28Mar2021, she noticed her arm felt like a bruise and that was it. Then the next day on Monday, 29Mar2021, the feeling was gone. She didn&#39;t have any redness. The outcome of the events her arm felt like a bruise and arm would get hurt was recovered on 29Mar2021, irregular heart rates, dyspnea, cough was not recovered and unknown outcome for has possible atrial fibrillation.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Stroke; MRI showed Pontine Stroke; left arm was weak; her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble/she cannot write or type; arm was sore; she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred; was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4; was not able to walk at first; her arm was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 08:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no prior vaccination in four weeks. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol and takes 20mg once a day prior to stroke and in the hospital they increased it to 40mg once a day and ongoing; ramipril taken for blood pressure and she was prescribed with this medication for a while prior to her stroke. It was discontinued in the hospital. Stated that she did not take it everyday because she was allergic to it; and sitagliptin (JANUVIA [SITAGLIPTIN]) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and stated that she has been taking for quite a while. On 24Feb2021 she had her second shot. She said that everything was fine that morning; that afternoon her arm was sore. Stated she thought nothing of it. That evening she entertained guest. They were saying she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred. She had gotten her vaccine at around 08:00. Again, she didn&#39;t think anything about her speech. On 25Feb2021, she got up and did some laundry going up and down the steps. Stated that it was difficult because her arm was still sore. She cleaned the house. At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular. She had a loop recorder implanted to monitor her heart and they haven&#39;t found anything wrong on it. She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn&#39;t find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor&#39;s told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She&#39;s been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn&#39;t do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported. The patient has been doing therapy for 7 weeks, twice a day; and stated she likely still has months more of therapy to try and get her left side back to normal. She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn&#39;t know what made it go up. Then states she doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day. The patient stated that stroke and heart problems do not run in her family. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp; her lips had started swelling; her tongue was tingling; she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction; she was just tired; type 1 hypersensitivity; a little soreness; It was like heaviness on her chest; having trouble breathing; allergic contact dermatitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a physician. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 14Apr2021 10:00 (lot number: EP7533) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing nickel allergy for decades which was under control and panic attacks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 14Apr2021, it was reported that the patient didn&#39;t have any of the normal side effects such as fevers or chills but she was just tired and went to sleep early that night. She woke up on 15Apr2021 at 05:00 with incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit that she wears to bed. She has a history of nickel allergy and she bought this particular Fitbit on purpose because it doesn&#39;t have any nickel in it that touches her skin and she has had no problems all year with the Fitbit. The itching was unbelievably bad and when she took the Fitbit off she had a horrible whelp under a tiny piece of metal that isn&#39;t even supposed to touch her skin. She thought well if it has exacerbated her nickel allergy then maybe it is doing something else to her body. On that day (15Apr2021), she thought that she had a panic attack and upon reading some information online, she thinks that it was the beginning of anaphylactic reaction because the symptoms are the same. She was thinking that the vaccine is doing something with her nickel allergy. It had used to be bad until she got it under control and she had it under control for many years. But with the things under the Fitbit she was blaming or associating it with the COVID vaccine so she took it off and then finally fell asleep again. But when she woke up in the morning, just a few hours later (15Apr2021), the bad whelp was still there and then her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling so she decided to look some more on google and she thinks that this is another version to an allergic reaction. She has had panic attacks before and she knows what they are now and she has learned through a therapist on how to get past and manage them but this was different for her. It was like heaviness on her chest and it felt like something was on top of her chest and she was having trouble breathing; both on an unspecified date in 2021. Her husband knows when she has a panic attack but this one was different she can&#39;t really explain it. She asks, what is the difference between a panic attack breathing and this type of breathing and later mentioned that she also had a little soreness (2021). In addition, the physician also called to report that this patient was complaining about 2 types of symptoms. The first was more an allergic contact dermatitis (2021) which the physician is not worried about. The second was lip swelling and tongue tingling which could be a type 1 hypersensitivity (2021). The physician is more concerned about the latter and would like to know if  it is okay to pre-medicate the patient with Benadryl before getting the second dose. The outcome of the event &#39;she was just tired&#39; was recovered on 14Apr2021; incredibly horrible itching under her Fitbit; whelp was recovering; her lips had started swelling and her tongue was tingling was recovered on 15Apr2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                D Dimer was high; Chest tightness; blood clots in the lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 63-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 14Apr2021 10:30 (Lot Number: ER2613) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing retinal tear from an unknown date (long ago, maybe 2005), Blood pressure, anxiety, reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, eye care. Three years ago, patient had a blood clot on the portal vein. She was treated with Eliquis, referring to Apixaban, for six months. Then they went into the D Dimer and found out she only had one gene for the blood clots, so they discontinued Eliquis, referring to Apixaban. The doctor said the protocol didn&#39;t call for it because she only had one gene. Eliquis, referring to Apixaban, was discontinued a year and half ago. The reporter mentioned the specifically didn&#39;t get the Johnson and Johnson shot due to blood clots. Family History included that her mother and sister had blood clots in the past unrelated to the vaccine, anxiety which her mom has. Concomitant medications included ramipril taken for blood pressure from an unspecified start date (for five to ten years) and ongoing; ongoing omeprazole taken for reflux; fluoxetine  taken for anxiety (for what her mom has) taking for three years and ongoing; linaclotide (LINZESS) taken for irritable bowel syndrome taking for 3 year and ongoing; magnesium sulfate taken for eye care taking for 3 year and ongoing; latanoprost taken for retinal tear from 2005 and ongoing.  Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. The patient previously received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 26MAR2021 at 1000AM in the right upper arm (Lot number for first dose is ER8732; expiration date 31Jul2021). Last Wednesday she started to have tightness in her chest so they called an ambulance. She was admitted to the hospital 28Apr2021 and was discharged Saturday 01May2021. In the hospital they did a CT and it came out that she had bilateral blood clots in the lungs; the doctor said it was a shower of blood clots in the lungs, small enough not to occlude anything. They treated with a 72 hour heparin drip. They didn&#39;t do any more CT but they did put her on Eliquis, referring to Apixaban, for the rest of her life. For the Eliquis he mentioned the generic Apixaban; unknown manufacturer; caller did not see NDC, lot, or expiration date on product dispensed in a pharmacy vial. Last time she was also on the Apixaban, not the brand Eliquis but they have discarded all the old product. The patient also did an X Ray; EKG (Electrocardiogram) was normal sinus; all the blood work including the CBC (Full blood count) was normal on an unknown date; her D Dimer was high on 01May2021. The events required a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome of the event chest pain was recovered with sequelae, of  blood clots in the lungs was not recovered, of other events was unknown.   Batch/Lot number had been obtained. Further information has been requested

It was throbbing and in the frontal region with nausea. No phonophobia. No weakness. No vision loss. No speech impediment.  She was somewhat less active given her severe headache. She was found to have a DVT in the left arm and bilateral PE with heart strain. Referred to Hospital and admitted. Started on lovenox 1 mg/kg every 12 hrs and elected to be transition to coumadin since her sister had another blood clot on Eliquis.  Neurology started her on gabapentin. She was discharged and told to follow-up with hematology and warfarin clinic. Presented to the ER on 4/27/21 with SOB at night that had been worsening the past 2 nights. Denied dyspnea or chest pain. Sx were thought to be due to anxiety given her hx of panic attacks. She was discharged home and saw hematology the following day. Hematologist noted that her SOB was gradually improving and her left arm swelling and vascular changes had resolved. Repeat CT showed improvement in clotting burden and stable pulmonary and hepatic nodules.

My face, eyes, and throat started swelling up. I was rushed to the ER. My throat was dry. They immediately gave me the EpiPen. My body started acting uncontrollably. I was shaking and shivering and going through a bunch of uncontrolled body movements. They gave me oxygen. I had an IV in my left arm and they gave me injections in my right arm. I was very dizzy. They continued to observe me, they drew my blood. More doctors came in and they told me not to get the second dose of the vaccine. I was transported to hospital by ambulance.  2 o&#39;clock in the morning they told me I could go home and they gave me a prescription. I was very jittery. It was hard for me to walk. I went home with the prescription. Around 7 o&#39;clock in the morning I woke to take my prescription. I had heart problems. I was still dizzy, jittery, and nervous. I called my PCP to put in my prescription and was told to go back to urgent care immediately. My eyes, nose, lips, and throat swelled. I could still breath but my tongue felt different. After they saw me again, I got another EpiPen in my leg. I started shaking uncontrollably again. They injected me in my right arm to calm down the reactions. I was kept there till 9pm that day. It was difficult for me to walk again. I went home and laid down. They gave me prednisone for 7 days. On the 3rd day I was having heart problems again. During that time I didn&#39;t have a appetite. My intestines felt like they were trying to come out of my body. I was very uncomfortable. I had gas. I put myself on a schedule to eat soup. I was very nauseous. Those symptoms lasted for 6 weeks. I couldn&#39;t drive for 4 weeks. I was still dizzy. I was able to sleep for 4 hours. I couldn&#39;t remember things. I have a cough that hasn&#39;t gone away. My doctors told me I am anaphylaxis.

                                                In beginning of March 2021, noticed blood pressure was elevated. My physician changed my medication one in the afternoon and one in the morning, but after I had the second vaccine she adjusted my  medication dosage up. In the middle of March my blood pressure suddenly dropped, and I went to the ER, they did cardiogram levels, EKG, chest x-rays, echocardiogram, kept me over night, because they thought I might have had a stroke, but I did not.  I believe that it was the change in my blood pressure medication.  My blood pressure elevation went up to 180 for diastolic and was running between 120 or 140 with my blood pressure medication.  In April 2021, I started feeling I was getting a cold, went to a clinic, saw a NP gave me medication and four days later I went again to the ER. On 04-21-2021  at the ER, all exams were repeated, EKG?s, found I had bilateral pneumonia, heart blockage.    I am a nurse scientist,  I think they survey is not written correctly, my opinion, the instructions should be clearer to any person reporting an symptoms.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 15May2021 (Batch/Lot number unknown), as dose 2, single, at age 63 years old, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had a remote history of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) from an unknown date, not reported if ongoing or not. The patent was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient received unspecified medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) received on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number unknown), as dose 1, single, for COVID-19 immunisation. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. On 22May2021, 7 days after the second vaccination, the patient experienced nonspecific constitutional symptoms and some GI symptoms. The patient was found to have ITP recurrence. The events resulted to hospitalization on 23Jun2021. Treatment for the events included IVIG and steroids. The patient was recovering from the events. It was unknown if the events were associated with the vaccine dose.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available and a close temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events  . The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

Around the 1st week of April 2021, I consulted with a cardiologist and did an EKG, Stress test, ECHO and Holter monitor. The Holter monitor confirms multiple v-tach. I was prescribed a Metoprolol and Verapamil. I am being referred to an electrophysiologist and I have been out of work since 6/9/2021. Even with the new medications, I am still having cardiac issues and tachycardia.

Medical history included surgery (She had surgery on her neck and spine 15 years ago) and has been on Lyrica since. The doctor messed up and got a nerve and the doctor prescribed her Lyrica. Her leg would be dragging if she didn&#39;t take Lyrica. Her doctor told her she could get off of it if she wanted to, but caller doesn&#39;t want to. It is too much of a process to do that. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she had hip replacement and she also stated she had hematoma on top of the stitches. Caller stated that she took Lyrica when she was in the hospital after her hip replacement. Caller clarified that two weeks after the second hip replacement she had to go back to the hospital due to a little bump on the road and was there for six days. Caller clarified that she had two hip replacements. The first one went fine, but the second did not. The first hip replacement was on her left hip and the second hip replacement was on her right hip. She had gained 20 pounds. She had been home since February. She had not worked since Feb 2021. The patient was hospitalized for hip replacement (hip arthroplasty) from 01Mar2021 to 02Mar2021.

She had the first hip replacement on 01Mar2021 and stayed one night in the hospital and was discharged on 02Mar2021. She had the second hip replacement on 18Jun2021, and they kept her one day in the hospital and discharged her on 19Jun2021. Then two weeks later she went back to the hospital and stayed for six days. Caller clarified that the reason she was back in the hospital two weeks after the second hip replacement was due to hematoma on top of the stitches (unspecified date). The staples had stretched out on the suture. When it stretched out a bubble of blood came up (unspecified date). They told her to massage it. She could not see it. It must had popped it and fluid went everywhere (unspecified date). Fluid was in there when her doctor opened her up again. He wanted to make sure her hardware was sterile, so he went in and cleaned it up. She was on IVs for the next 4 weeks. Caller clarified that her doctor took out her stitches and then called her the next day and she still had fluid, so her doctor wanted her to go in. Her stepdad had the same doctor and the same thing happened. Her stepdad rejected it and the doctor did not want caller to reject hers like her step dad. No further details provided. she has had a lot of blood work when she was in the hospital. She had to have a blood transfusion when she was in the hospital because it went low to six. She has a nurse that would come to her house twice a week to take blood work because she was on antibiotics. They were making sure her kidneys were working (unspecified date). No further details provided. Caller stated she did not have any reactions or anything like that. Some people wished they had nothing. She had a sore arm, but she had put an ice pack on it.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EC1284), via an unspecified route of administration administered to left arm/deltoid on 29Dec2020 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a research medical facility; and received warfarin sodium (COUMADIN, strength 2 mg), oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date in 2017 and ongoing at &#34;3 1/2 tablets once daily in the evening at 5:30pm (total 7mg)&#34; for metal heart valve. The patient&#39;s medical history included had the surgery (for her metal heart valve), about 01Mar in 2017 (about 4 years ago) and so she thought she had been on Coumadin for about 4 years, had been on the 7mg dose for over a year; and has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin for the metal heart valve. Denied illness. Denied family medical history relevant to event. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Shingrix vaccine in past and remenbered she had the usual side effects from it, had mild symptoms. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines the same date of the Pfizer Suspect or 4 weeks prior. On Jan2021, the patient experienced scratched arm and bled through 3 shirts, it kept bleeding. On 04Jan2021, her international normalised ratio (INR) was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2). The events did not lead to emergency room visit, however led to physician office visit. The events were reported as serious medically significant. The nurse got the first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 29Dec2020 because she is a healthcare provider. She wanted information on increasing INR. The nurse has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin. Her INR was typically 1.7 to 2.3. She reported her last INR, before the covid-19 vaccine was given, was &#34;some time ago&#34; but it had not varied much over the years. Normally she got her INR run and it was about 2.  She had to be scheduled for her INR on the 04Jan2021 and it was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2) and they asked about anything that may have changed and the only thing was that she got her first shot. The nurse reported not having any changes in her medications, food, or life style to account for the change, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient stated that it could be a serious problem if she had an accident or fell and started bleeding. A normal person&#39;s lab result is between 1 and 2, but they like to keep people with the metal heart valves between 2 and 3. She had been bleeding. She had barely scratched her arm the other day and went through 3 shirts because she kept bleeding. This is more than unusual for her, it&#39;s kind of unusual.  Getting the vaccine is the only variant she has had since getting her last INR. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included INR (normal range 1 to 2): typically 1.7 to 2.3 on an unspecified date; it&#39;s about 2 on an unspecified date: and 5.8 on 04Jan2021. The action taken in response to the events for warfarin sodium was dose not changed. The outcome of the event INR was 5.8 was not recovered, for the other events was unknown. The nurse (patient) assessed the event &#34;INR was 5.8; it&#39;s normally about 2&#34; as related to the COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of International normalised ratio increased and wound hemorrhage due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                48 hours (Feb 26) after receiving the shot, I had anaphylaxis symptoms... red blotches around mouth, swelling face, swelling lips, ants-crawling feeling on face, neck and scalp. Went to Urgent Care, given benadryl and steroid shot. Rx Prednisone 20 mg x2, 5 days. Anaphylaxis happened again the next day (Feb 27) just prior to taking the first prednisone. Went back to Urgent Care, another shot. Meds kept full on allergic reactions at bay on Monday and Tuesday. Had swelling face, lips and tongue happen in Primary Care office on March 3, received another shot and increased prednisone rx to 30 mg x2, with taper. On March 5, happened again, went to ER, where doc changed timing of prednisone to 60 mg all in one dose. All in conjunction with hydroxyzine 25 mg every 12 hours and 50 mg of benadryl every six hours.  Situation continues with mild swelling, itchy sensations happening just before it is time to take new meds .

She was taken to the emergency room and was diagnosed with pericardial effusion and admitted for treatment that included draining fluid from the sac around her heart.  She was released and then developed the same symptoms again within a week.  She again had pericardial effusion, and was told she had severe emphysema with no prior diagnosis.  She is still hospitalized and is now suffering heart failure with no clear diagnosis as to why, no acceptable plan of treatment, and a prognosis of wait and see.  She has consistently tested negative for Covid19.

A 64-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection and Lot Number: ER2613) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Mar2021 at 11:00 am (at the age of 64-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included persistent atrial fibrillation, allergies to sulfa. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Heart in regular sinus rhythm for several months prior to vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included dofetilide (TIKOSYN) 250mcgtwice daily, loratadine and ibuprofen, (all received within 2 weeks of vaccination). The patient previously took dofetilide (TIKOSYN) for atrial fibrillation (persistent atrial fibrillation was controlled with 250mcg twice daily); also took erythromycin and had allergies. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 20Mar2021 at 17:15, the patient developed weak, rapid, irregular heartbeat indicative of atrial fibrillation. This last 8 hours. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Patient noted regular heartbeat on 21Mar2021 at 1:15am. Patient visited to physician office for events. The outcome for the event was recovered on 21Mar2021 at 1:15am.  Follow up attempts needed. Further information is expected.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at age 64 years, on 29Mar2021 14:25 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation as a pre-existing condition that normally she would be in atrial fibrillation for 3-8 hours, or maybe 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours at the most and overweight from unspecified date but working on it. Only she has heart history in her family. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications was none. Patient historically took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot: EN6199) with anatomical Location of left arm on 08Mar2021 around 1300 for COVID-19 immunization and flu vaccine received back in 2020 for immunisation.  Patient reported that she had the second dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on Monday, 29Mar2021 and three hours later, her heart started fibrillating for 36 hours. She has a pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation and normally she would be in atrial fibrillation for 3-8 hours, or maybe 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours at the most, never 36 hours. Patient contacted the doctor right away via phone. Her doctor, an electrophysiologist, stated not to eat or drink anything after midnight and of patient was still in atrial fibrillation in the morning they would have to perform a cardioversion, with the paddles. Doctor believed this could happen and said its a delicate balance when you put anything else into the system that it could affect persons. On 31Mar2021 at 05:15 that morning, the patient went out of atrial fibrillation and back into normal sinus rhythm. Patient only called the doctor and would have had to go in today if the fibrillation did not stop. Patient also stated that well, it was not a good thing to fibrillate for that long, with due time it can cause congestive heart failure and stated its dangerous. Patient was resting at the time of report and was relieved she is not fibrillating anymore. Patient reported that her body feels like it was hit with a mac truck on Mar2021. Heart fibrillating for 36 hours makes you really tired. The outcome of the event &#39;heart started fibrillating for 36 hours/she would be in atrial fibrillation for 3-8 hours, or maybe 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours at the most, never 36 hours&#39; was recovered on 31Mar2021 at 05:15 in the morning, while for the rest of the events it was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

A 64-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER2613, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 1900 wherein blood pressure was high prior to her atrial fibrillation medications; A fib (atrial fibrillation) from 2016 and ongoing; and ongoing heartrate low. As a child the caller had the vaccine in the sugar cube (unspecified) and her mouth was swelling from it; and stated that patient&#39;s sister was hospitalized after receiving the same vaccine. Family medical history included mom has hypertension. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 5 mg twice a day; sotalol taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 80 mg, twice a day; and diltiazem taken for A fib (atrial fibrillation) from an unspecified start date and ongoing at 180 mg, once a day.  The patient was a healthcare worker and she has had friends who have died from covid. The patient had no previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient stated she had the first dose of the vaccine and had a TIA (Apr2021) and rupture of a blood vessel in her eye 20Mar2021. The TIA was on Monday (Apr2021) and she was supposed to have her second dose tomorrow (09Apr2021). She stated she may get it but she is not taking it tomorrow because she is still having residual symptoms. She asked what the length of time she can wait to get it before she has to restart. Patient reported that after she got her first vaccine she had a ruptured blood vessel in her eye the next day (20Mar2021). She put warm and cool compresses on her eye then the ruptured blood vessel subsided. The ruptured blood vessel came back again a few days later and this time it was the entire sclera. She developed blood clots in her eye and the doctor said it probably wasn&#39;t from the vaccine (Mar2021). She was supposed to get her second dose of the vaccine tomorrow 09Apr2021 but she was going to hold off for now. She then had a TIA (Mar2021) and became hospitalized because of it from 06Apr2021 to 07Apr2021. The patient has ongoing atrial fibrillation but has been taking her medication religiously. She believed that the TIA was from the vaccine as there was no explanation as to why it happened. Her heart rate was low anyways from the medications (dates unspecified) but it dropped to 35 when she was in the hospital (Apr2021). The patient&#39;s primary care provide was not the attending in the hospital when the caller was hospitalized. Furthermore, it was reported that on 21Mar2021, patient&#39;s eye was super red but only on one side of her left eye. On Tuesday, 22Mar2021, caller went to see her primary care provider and they told the patient to put a warm compress and no eye drops in her eye, that helped. Then that Friday, 25Mar2021, the patient&#39;s sclera looked like her eye was bleeding and her pupil started turning a different color.  Then last Monday (Apr2021), the patient woke up and her right arm, the right side of her face, and her right knee were numb she got up and went to see if she had a facial droop and did not. The patient thought it was from her sleeping wrong, but these symptoms did not go away. The patient went to the Emergency Room where they did a CT of her head and neck, with and without contrast which was negative. The patient was admitted on 06Apr2021 to the observation unit where they did an MRI and ECHO, which were both negative and she was diagnosed with a TIA and possible pinched nerve (Apr2021). The patient denied any heavy lifting prior to this event other than normal day to day things. The patient was discharged on Wednesday 07Apr2021. The patient&#39;s face felt like its burning, she has numbness in her right finger and right thumb. Physical therapy and occupational therapy said the patient should be okay but to be careful with things that were hot because she was at risk of burning herself. The second time the patient&#39;s eye became red, her vision was kind of blurry (Apr2021) and she didn&#39;t know if the blood was in her pupil. The only deficit that the patient has now is sensational loss in her right hand (Apr2021) and that should improve per the occupational therapist at the hospital. The caller was supposed to get the second dose of the vaccine on 09Apr2021 but she doesn&#39;t want to take it while she is having these symptoms. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient included: head ct with and without contrast: negative on 06Apr2021; MRI brain: negative on 06Apr2021; Echocardiogram: negative on 07Apr2021; speech evaluation: passed on 07Apr2021. The patient asked what the efficacy is after one dose and if a booster will be needed since she is only protected for 6 months. Patient asked if she needed to restart the series of vaccinations if she doesn&#39;t get the second vaccine tomorrow 09Apr2021. The events ruptured blood vessel in eye, blood clot in eye, sclera looked like her eye was bleeding, eye was super red were reported as serious medically significant, and heart rate dropped as life-threatening. As reported, the events required emergency room and physician&#39;s office visit.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events rupture of a blood vessel in her eye, and eye was super red. The outcome of the events reported was unknown. As per reporter, the events ruptured blood vessel in eye, blood clot in eye, and heart rate dropped were related to the covid BioNTech vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the reported events with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.

                                                my auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it.   My auntie, passed away the next two days after she got her Pfizer Covid vaccine.   My auntie, who is 65 years old, got her Pfizer vaccine the the morning of April 22 2021. She told us he was completely find on the day of the vaccine. But the next morning around 9 am, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  The reported death reason is due to Bowel Ischemia with Perforation and it has nothing to do with Pfizer vaccine that she got. But I believe it is her post Pfizer covid vaccine reaction that result in Bowel Ischemia with Perforation.  My auntie lived with a very healthy life style. She walked every morning, and has a shorter walk in the evening. She has no blood pressure, no blood sugar, everything is fine with her medical check.  My auntie had a kidney transplant 20&#43; years ago and she is on the track for monthly doctor visit. When she asked her general doctor if she could get the vaccine, her general doctor asked her to consult her kidney doctor. She then went to ask her kidney doctor and her kidney doctor call her general doctor to discuss her health conditions. Both of her doctor decided that she could take the vaccine and one of the doctor registered her for the vaccine on April 15 2021. The she nurse told her to came in for vaccine on Apr 22, and she is now death after the Pfizer vaccine.    I only read about people with recent organ transplant is not recommended to take the Covid vaccine. But there is no information about people that ever had kidney transplant shouldn?t take the vaccine.   My auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it without a clear explanation.   I would like you to contact health department to follow up on this case and find out the real root cause. If the vaccine is not recommended for people that ever got kidney transplant, CDC should publish the information so that there won?t be more victims.   Please take necessary action ASAP.     Thank you!

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, at age 64 years, administered in left arm on 05Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8734) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunization, in order to go back to normal, without a mask so she was told she had to have one. Medical history included hysterectomy, anxiety, disorder in thyroid and cholesterol. Patient had family history of dementia, had to stay home and take care of her mom who is a heart patient and has dementia. Patient had no history of previous immunizations. Patient&#39;s concomitant medication includes unspecified medications one is for thyroid, one is for cholesterol and the other 2 are for anxiety. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. Patient&#39;s symptoms started with a headache the morning after the shot (05Apr2021), was on and off for a couple of days, lasted 3 days or so for a couple days and she took paracetamol (TYLENOL). On 09Apr2021, Friday morning, patient woke up so nauseous she couldn&#39;t hold anything down. It was just bile coming up, and she had severe diarrhea and so sick vomiting that wouldn&#39;t stop, stomach pain, couldn&#39;t hold her own weight up. She got medication at a walk in clinic and that didn&#39;t stop it. She started out at acute/urgent care, where she was taken by her daughter on Sunday, 11Apr2021, because she was feeling so bad and was tested for COVID and they said if it does not get better to go to the Emergency Room and she continued having problems. It was not COVID. They said she was dehydrated and send her home to push fluids and drink Pedialyte. Monday or Tuesday (Apr2021) she was in the ER all night (she does not remember the day because all of her days are mixed up). They did CAT scans on her abdomen and ran blood work. They didn&#39;t see anything in her abdomen. Her white blood cell count and kidney and liver function were all elevated and they said it was from being dehydrated from diarrhea and vomiting. They gave her fluids and sent her home. Within another 48 hours she still had vomiting and diarrhea, it was a clear bile and a sharp pain in her side. Her stools were dark tarry stringy stuff so she went back to the ER and waited in the lobby for 9 hours. In that 9 hours as she was waiting, she felt like she had to go to the bathroom. She was then wheeled into the bathroom and started passing blood. It wasn&#39;t coming from the urethra. It must have come form the vagina, she doesn&#39;t have a uterus. There were clots. She started passing blood in her urine but most was in the vaginal area but she has already had a hysterectomy. She was passing clots and her doctor who works in the healthcare field looked at it and said they were clots. Very shortly after, she passed the clot and the pain went away. The pain was passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area at one point went away but she still have nausea and diarrhea and they gave her more fluids and sent her home. They didn&#39;t really want to address the vaginal bleeding. Patient have not been back and was not sure if she is still dehydrated. Patient was still pushing fluids and still not back to normal. Patient&#39;s daughter told her that since it was 5 days later it was not a reaction. Patient was thinking maybe it was an allergic internal severe reaction. Patient was weighing 130 pounds but lost about 4 pounds during this illness, so 4 pounds lighter. She stated her daughter-in-law was doing research and found a blog and there are woman the caller&#39;s age complaining of these symptoms (unexplained bleeding) after the vaccine. She asked if this was from the vaccine. She stated she was so sick that if there is even a chance then she doesn&#39;t want the second dose. She asked if this is a coincidence or has it been reported. She stated she is trying to make a decision on if she should get the second dose because she heard other people have symptoms and take the second shot. The outcome of the events passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area, headache, a sharp pain in her side, passing blood in her urine, passing clots/were clots/in the vaginal area/vaginal bleeding was recovered on Apr2021, while for the other events, it was unknown.

Some dr blamed it on the morphine but have had past unconscious hospitalization when sudden withdrawal from gabapentin which resulted from vomiting.  Have never had problem with heart kidneys or lungs before this.   Was given (medication) three times but it didn&#39;t bring me back to normal.  As for level of morphine sudden stoppage of gabapetin CA  affect the levels in blood. I was told not to get the second vaccine but not one dr in hospital seemed to want to report this and I don&#39;t think its right. I am going to have bill from being in intensive care and who knows what this will cost me.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) and a physician. A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 09Apr2021 in the afternoon around 2 or 3 o clock (Batch/Lot Number: EW0153) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 vaccination. The vaccination was done in her building, a medical team came to them. She lives in subsidized housing. The patient&#39;s medical history included tendonitis; juvenile idiopathic arthritis from Dec 1969 and ongoing; lupus nephritis from 1989 (diagnosed ten years after SLE); systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from Dec 1979; discoid lupus; proliferative kidney disease stage 3; sjogren&#39;s; raynaud&#39;s; arthritis (since she was 13); bursitis; oral necrosis (this was from being on a calcium drug that they give menopausal women, it was out of her head right now when reporting. She could not think of the name. The drug was supposed to promote bone growth and keep her from getting osteoporosis); menopausal (because of chemo she started menopause at 42); vulvar lichen sclerosus; filamentary keratosis from 2015 and ongoing (this was since either Feb 2015 or Mar 2015); kidney cysts(one is benign and one is being watched); liver hepatic hemangioma; allergies (Allergies to aspirin, penicillin, dextrose IV, Biaxin, Levaquin, Cipro, band-aid adhesive, zofran, sulfa topical. The sulfa is a topical as opposed to being the sulpha with a ph.); adeno conjunctivitis from Jan2015 and ongoing (she had a really bad case of this in JAN 2015 and had to quarantine for three weeks. She lost her vision, she could not see for three days. She got a fever. It left her with a filament thing. It is just delightful. It is viral and really bad. She got it at her eye doctors office when she was there for an annual visit. She sometimes had to go there 3 times to have filament growing on her eye scrubbed off. It is wicked painful. It is quite an adventure.); she used to be three quarters but she shrunk a little; has been a couch potato for a year, it comes with the territory with lockdown and being depressed; she is immunocompromised and catches many things and is high risk She feels like a sitting duck; had issues on her palm of hands; had issues on her breasts, and chest; and various problems. Family Medical History Relevant to adverse events was none.  No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No other vaccines administered on same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. Concomitant medications included vitamin b complex (B-COMPLEX 100) 100 as dose did not clarify units, has been on for years; hydroxyzine embonate (HYDROXYZINE PAM) Dosage 25 mg, she did not remember indication, may be allergies, if she is around a cat, she takes it prophylactically; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) low strength, 81 mg twice a week, has been on for decades, nephrologist put her on it in the 90&#39;s and She did not remember why, he said it preserves kidney function or it is good for overall health; pentoxifylline ongoing at 400 mg, 3 a day, she has been on for years, her vascular doctor prescribed; prednisone dosage:1 mg, she takes and alternates between 6 and 7 mg, If she takes lower than that, she is a &#34;narcoleptic&#34; (as reported, did not clarify); rosuvastatin Dosage:10 mg, frequency not specified, it is a nightly thing; fish oil (SUPER OMEGA 3) overall supplement that was suggested by former nephrologist at some point some; estradiol (YUVAFEM) Dosage:10 micrograms for menopause, vaginal dryness; there was no variable in her medication routine, she is on a long list of medications (she could not remember, one was blood pressure, with the last administration she was worked up and her blood pressure would not come down, she also takes Tylenol as needed), she provided the details as she knows them, but did not know full details for all of her medications. There was nothing new to her routine except like when Prilosec was taken off the market, she got a different medication for it. She has been on all of these for long term maintenance.  Historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 19MAR2021 (at the age of 64-year-old)(Batch/Lot Number: ER2613) for covid-19 vaccination, adverse events following prior vaccinations: none; and flu vaccine for immunization in last fall, 2020. She has a history of obscure side effects to medication, things that people have never heard of and she is the 1 in a million that has ever had these problems. The patient previously took ondansetron (ZOFRAN), (&#34;a chemotherapy treatment&#34;, given before chemotherapy), which gave her a homicidal migraine and they had to give her ice packs for her head; 9 rounds of &#34;Cytox&#34; (Cytoxin or Cytoxan) she was not sure how this was spelled, and chemotherapy (9 rounds of chemo); azathioprine (IMURAN), she does not know if it was spelled Immuran or Imuran; prednisone a number of years and she said to her rheumatologist, &#34;it did not make sense on an intellectual basis that the prednisone being effective in her body as it was once&#34; and he said he would give her IMURAN which is given to kidney patients to cause less of a reaction with the organ, and patient mentioned she had barely an immune system after all these years on prednisone, she went through 3 rounds of steroids; Heparin IV, which  made her arm feel on fire on the inside, which they would not give her a flush when she had IV treatment; Dextrose IV made her skin feel hot and itchy, her mouth felt like she put something in that had been soaking in rubbing alcohol; ciprofloxacin (reported as &#34;Cipro&#34;), she had a bad reaction to Cipro, she was given after she was bit by a dog on her calves, she knew it was attached to and is &#34;hurting her calves the rest of her life/the podiatrist said if it has not gone away, she is kind of stuck&#34; (as reported, not specified). The patient just wanted to give Pfizer a full picture of what she was dealing with and she is an unusual case. She added that chemo was in the 90s and that is when all of the medication reactions she mentioned were. She absolutely does not have any of the information about the products she mentioned she had previous reactions to. Every time they did &#34;this&#34;, it &#34;hurt&#34; and she asked them not to do it anymore. She asked them to not do dextrose anymore with the chemo because it feels like it is on fire, and she asked them to mix it with saline. She did not have any additional information, did not have the NDC, LOT, expiration date, or manufacturer for any of these medications she reported historical adverse events on. The patient reported that she got her 2nd shot of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 09Apr2021. She has soreness at the site, more-so several hours after getting the vaccine (09Apr2021). Just her arm felt sore within moments after the second vaccine, but she did not get this after the first. She rested and took it easy that weekend. There was Sore, Tired, general lethargy, and fatigue (Apr2021): when she looked online, it really only told her what everyone knows about that you might be sore and tired and she had all that, she thought she was through with all of that. She had no chills, just general lethargy and fatigue. She was sluggish and tired and not herself that weekend (Apr 2021). She stayed home so it is difficulty to say. Her arm was definitely sore. For sluggishness and fatigue, she said that she has been a couch potato for a year, it comes with the territory with lockdown and being depressed, so it is difficult to decide if it is health or physically induced or a emotional base. She did not knowingly spike a fever, no chills or sweats. And on Monday (did not clarify dates but states it was Monday after 09APR2021, throughout the weekend she took it easy), she noticed with her foot, she had difficulty getting out of bed could not put weight on her right foot. She was alarmed. She stayed home and rested and did a lot of napping and taking it slow. It is still difficulty and moving certain ways hurts more if she flexes. She has a known history of tendonitis so she wore her brace in the meantime. She thought maybe she had tendonitis in both ankles and this was similar so maybe it was a different set of tendons. She would wear a brace, and eventually it will get better in time. She also was wearing braces like compression socks that toes stick out of. She thought she had tendonitis and that is what she has done in the past. It has been a month and she is not better. This was her left foot, most of the pain was focused on the sole of her foot towards the outer edge. That is where it started. Then it migrated over time. That was weird and had her worried. It was all in her arch in the initial spot. She notes it is not like the tendonitis she had the first time. She does not want to be an alarmist or have her doctor think she is a hypochondriac she waited. She was then rubbing her foot, the right one, and noticed it was tender on the top of her foot just like the left one. There was sore. There was pain in right foot, pain in feet. Pain in feet, her left foot had most of the pain on the top and bottom and a lot of it is along the outer part of her sole of the foot. In her right foot, the pain is mostly at the fleshy part below her toes and on top of her foot. The pain moved around into the other foot for about a month so she went to the podiatrist yesterday (06May2021) and doctor did x-rays. The night before (05May2021), the opposite leg had a line of black and blue dots on her right calf that went up her leg, she did not notice this until Wednesday (05May2021) evening because she never examines it. She soaped up a washcloth and she knew where her parts are in the bath. Her mind wanders and she was not looking. She happened to be wearing something where her legs were not covered and that is how she knew. It did not hurt. It was strange, looking like bruising in a line. The doctor said it was all like one vein and he cold feel it. She can not feel it, but he could. The doctor told her these could be clots. She still has them. Doctor said the other leg where she had the pain was only soft tissue pain. Doctor found that every place that hurt when he touched it and it still hurts where he had touched it. She was told she does not have arthritis and she has had arthritis since she was 13. The doctor did not know what it is. It was her left foot constantly, and the right foot hurt off and on during that period. The left for sure was kind of a dull ache and throbbing. The right was only a little bit. The left was worse. It appeared to be soft tissue that was hurting and he said there are so many side effects of this new vaccine and to maybe try heat or ice. Ever since the patient left doctor&#39;s office until now (the time of reporting) she did not known if she need to be concerned, that if she does not know what it is, can ice or heat make it worse? She did not know the next steps. Treatment, she tried to keep it elevated because that can not hurt but that is about it. She has not done heat and ice because if the doctor does not know what it is, how does he know it will not make it worse. He asked if she could take aspirin and she said no she is allergic to aspirin. Tylenol she does not take often, only when she feels like she needs it and she has not been doing it often. When she stays off it, it does not hurt as much as when she is walking. She wanted  to know if she should be worried and she wanted to add (report this) to the database if this is a side effect and if Pfizer has ever heard of this before. There was also tired, general lethargy, and fatigue. At this point when reporting, she is single and lives alone, and said that &#34;God forbid something happens, there is nobody to say let&#39;s get you to a hospital&#34;. She heard about blood clots on the news. When they said blood clot yesterday, it was a red warning light going on and a siren. At the time of reporting it was Friday and she did not know that if she need to rush to the hospital. Her primary care physician (PCP) said she had never heard of this and to call Pfizer. The patient asked if she is one of a small group of people this has happened to. She asked if she should not worry and it will go away or should she get to a hospital. She thought she had a problem with her feet (foot problem) but her podiatrist does not know what was going on. She communicated with her physician office today and she said she has never heard of this. She wanted to know if her symptoms have been heard of and if she should go to the hospital. The events did not require a visit to emergency room. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: height as &#34;5 and three quarters of an inch feet (5&#39;0.75&#34;)&#34; on an unspecified date; rapid COVID-19 test on 06May2021: negative; regular COVID-19 test on 06May2021: negative; x-ray on 06May2021 to make sure she did not break anything: unknown results. She also went because she had not done it in a year and she had something from the health department saying to get tested weekly for the virus (clarified that she was talking about the COVID tests as what she went and got done).  The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 at the age of 64 years old (Lot Number: ER8732) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Cancer: Gerson Therapy; Autoimmune disorder; allergies ongoing; Parvovirus B19: exposed to Parvo B virus, it&#39;s called the 5th Disease, she had a rare reaction to it and it gave her Rheumatoid Arthritis ongoing, Fibromyalgia ongoing, Multiple Sclerosis ongoing and Behcet&#39;s like overnight; allergies to food (she got swelling, intense depression, suicidal tendencies, and a fight or flight response), drugs (Tylenol and Aspirin, basically any pain killer, Percocet and Darvocet), air, dirt, trees, and bugs. It runs in her family; inflammation. Concomitant medications included ongoing fish oil (FISH OIL); ongoing curcuma longa (TURMERIC [CURCUMA LONGA]); several other supplements; ongoing Benadryl for allergies when need. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 19Mar2021 09:00 at the age of 64 years old (lot number: EN6207) in Left arm for Covid-19 immunization and experienced allergic reaction, throat itchy, numbness on her left side/ Legs were like spaghetti and she felt like the scarecrow in Wizard of Oz, lungs itchy and inflamed, coughing, barking asthma cough, Speech slurred, Oxygen level felt like it was in the 80s (80%), muscles not responding, Crooked walk, died 6 times and experienced an out of body experience. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Vaccine was not Administered at any Facility. No History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Caller wanted to know about the need for booster dose; Was it going to be like the first or second dose of the vaccine. Caller wanted to know the ingredient of the Pfizer covid vaccine. She said she took both of the doses and had a bad reactions from it. Caller stated she had a lot of issues with the first dose but not as bad as second dose. The second dose almost killed her and affected her brain and speech. She had the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, and experienced a bad reaction after both doses. Caller asking what was in the vaccine that could cause her bad reaction. She never had a reaction to any vaccine. She had allergies and autoimmune disorder. Her arm was so sore/ sore left arm the first time. It was difficult to get in and out of car for 3 weeks, but she recovered completely. She helps the handicap people, so she had it put in her left hip/ sore left hip. It was sore for about 2 weeks, but she recovered completely. Caller added she needed to decipher what was written on the vaccination card.  She wished they would write better. She used her glasses. Caller took no pharmaceuticals, just Benadryl for allergies when need. The Hospital where she received her vaccine was used and created by another facility, but not a an offsite facility. But for them to use also. Caller added she was cured of everything she had from the Therapy. After the second dose: She started same day as vaccine on 08Apr2021. She did her protocol that time, and as far as breathing and that, it was not like the first dose, but towards the evening she had an auto immune response that lasted for 3 weeks. She felt like she experienced mild sepsis and gained 10 pounds overnight of fluid. Her kidneys, bladder, intestines, stomach and she felt swollen and her liver too. When this happened it started with feeling puffy that evening and lasted for 3 weeks. Caller added if she was exposed to a virus, or had an allergic reaction this happens. Caller added even her lymph nodes got huge and thyroid felt swollen, felt like she had a tourniquet around her neck. That lasted for 3 weeks. It was bad the 1st week. That caused a severe headache that started on the 3rd day and lasted 4 days. It was really bad on the 1st day and she wanted to go to the Emergency Room. She took Benadryl and Ibuprofen, and a Doctor told her she shouldn&#39;t take Ibuprofen because of Covid. She was allergic to Tylenol and Aspirin, basically any pain killer, Percocet and Darvocet, Everything except Ibuprofen. Caller did not have the bottle to provide details. She usually put Ibuprofen in her Benadryl bottle for her inflammation. That was the only thing that she took. She took Turmeric and fish oil and several other supplements. Her headache peaked on the 4th day, and she took the Ibuprofen and was better the next day. Throat swelling started on the 5th day and lasted and was still causing her difficulty pronouncing words. Her tongue felt swollen. Her cognitive issues started the 4th day of her headache and was intense. It continued, but was much, much better. She did her normal protocol, and had gotten by, but it was not normal. Her organs felt swollen and the doctor did a test. It was normal, except her bladder, because it was so swollen she felt like she couldn&#39;t empty it completely. The muscles did not work right and she got an bladder infection and received antibiotics, about 2 weeks after the injection, because her bladder wasn&#39;t working right. Urine test: infection. Intense stomach ache: started at the time her headache stated after 3 days along with the headache and ended with her doing the Therapy. They lasted for 4 weeks. Pain in all her organs: started the 3rd day after the second dose. The pain started, she felt swelling and it lasted for 3 weeks, actually, for 4 weeks, the pain in the part of her liver by her stomach. She experienced a personality change and she wouldn&#39;t have the vaccine again. She couldn&#39;t remember where she put things, started on the 7th day after her second dose and lasted until the Therapy made her feel better. Finally, after 4 weeks, she recovered completely and was pretty much back normal now. Caller added she was a happy person and was with her Cancer. People asked how she did it. But with this experience she literally wanted to hurt someone or kill herself, and no it was not normal. She was so cranky. She was sure it was the swelling in her brain. With her food allergies she got swelling, intense depression, suicidal tendencies, and a fight or flight response.  She wanted to leave her life, it was scary. Caller added she did not feel like this now. For the Vaccine Indication: Caller added that people that need it most, didn&#39;t want it.  Because of her autoimmune disorder, she was a long huller and she had died 6 times, so she was willing to try it and take it and deal with the side effects. She was hoping it would not cause any. Her boyfriend died at Christmas. After 24 hours he was dead. He had a mild sepsis from a virus. He has Autoimmune disease. If she got Covid, she didn&#39;t want to end up like him and see her arms and legs amputated. Caller asked if anyone else had reported symptoms she had experienced. Caller asked to clarify details of her symptoms of suicide and killing and hurting others. Caller denied she was experiencing this at time of call. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events headache, Personality change, couldn&#39;t remember where she put things, bladder infection. The outcome of the events Pain in arm, Pain in hip, Personality change, couldn&#39;t remember where she put things, Stomach ache was recovered on an unspecified date, of cognitive issues was recovering, of the other events was unknown.

The patient was hospitalized for gi bleed from 25Mar2021 to 27Mar2021 and hospitalization details for the rest events were not speicifed. Reported as: Caller states she has ITP, so this means she makes antibodies that destroys her own platelets, her doctors told her to go ahead and get the Pfizer Covid vaccines, states she got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 22Mar2021, states three days later on 25Mar2021, hospitalized with a GI bleed and low platelets, states after that she was hospitalized three more times. States the first three were low platelets, states during second hospitalization she went into Afib and during the fourth hospitalization she had a heart attack due to the Afib. Caller states she was treated with immunosuppressants, IVIG, rituximab, an anti rejection medication called Cellcept to get her ITP under control. States the medication she was taking didn&#39;t seem to be working anymore.

I went to the doctor and was given an Echocardiogram (04/13/2021) where it showed I developed pericardia infusion. In June I went for a second Echocardiogram is it was less than what it showed in April.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated.

The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient reported a history of migraines/ weather migraines, that cause numbness in nose and foot as well as gastro-intestinal symptoms. The patient received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 08Jan2021 and felt a metallic taste in her mouth (said that the metallic taste lasted about three hours; ate to get rid of the metallic taste). On 29Jan2021, the patient received her second dose; after 10 minutes her face went numb; her nose, forehead, and under her eyes all the way up felt numb. Also, the patient&#39;s systolic blood pressure was at 150. The patient reported that she also tasted rubber band taste in her mouth. The patient&#39;s neighbor that was there with her getting the vaccine told the nurse and they called the paramedics. The paramedics stated that they thought she had a stroke. She said that her blood pressure was 150 systolic (usually 107-110/79). The patient had diastolic heart failure which was diagnosed about 5 years prior.

The patient&#39;s eye looked like a blood clot in the corner of her eye then it dispersed throughout the eye and then now it was just below the pupil of her eye. The patient called the doctor on 01Feb2021, but they were out because of the snow. On 02Feb2021, the patient received a call from the doctor&#39;s office saying that the physician assistant would call her back, but the patient had not heard anything yet. The blood circulated around her eye and now it was just only under her pupil. The patient said that her daughter sent her something that said that some people have gotten Bell&#39;s palsy after getting the vaccine. The patient said that she was concerned about this with the facial numbness.  The patient said that every once in a while, her face felt weird; her cheeks feel weird and her nose. The patient said that it comes and goes.  The day after she got the second shot, she felt like she got run over by a truck and like someone beat her up. The patient&#39;s migraines were under control with magnesium. The migraine came on so quick it was like a boom. The patient said that was why she was concerned. The patient said that she declined going to the hospital; and there was no trip to the emergency room or physician office.   The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: 150 systolic on 29Jan2021 (usually 107-110/79).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of stroke.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2; Lot number EL0140 for both doses, expiry date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid on 23Dec2020 at 15:00 single dose, and second dose via an unspecified route of administration to right deltoid on 13Jan2021 15:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunization, hepatitis a vaccine (HEPATITIS A) intramuscular on 29Dec2020 at single dose for immunization and varicella zoster vaccine rge (cho) (SHINGRIX) intramuscular from 29Dec2020 at single dose for immunization. Medical history included osteoporosis from 2011, osteoarthritis from an unknown date, Knee replacement (Reported due to the osteoarthritis, she had her one knee replaced in 2004 and her other knee replaced in 2011), Spinal compression fracture in 2011 (Reported she fell at work and had a spinal compression fracture in 2011. She said the spinal compression fracture was repaired by a vertebroplasty in 2011) and Hypothyroidism (she has had hypothyroidism for a long time, since either 1998 or 2000). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced rhabdomyolysis on 06Feb2021, fatigue extreme/felt tired on 30Dec2020, myalgia on 30Dec2020, pain on 30Dec2020, petechia on 06Feb2021, muscle cramps/muscle spasms on 17Feb2021, dry skin on Feb2021, itching on Feb2021 and her cpk was over 2400 on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for rhabdomyolysis from 06Feb2021 to 09Feb2021 and reported to have caused disability. All the other events were reported as medically significant. She said she wanted to report to Pfizer that she was admitted to the hospital on 06Feb2020. She said she was in rhabdomyolysis, and the rhabdomyolysis was really bad. She said she had so much fatigue, myalgia, and pain that she couldn&#39;t walk. She said she was given a lot of fluids while she was in the hospital. She said her CPK was over 2400 when she was admitted to the hospital on 06Feb2021. She said she had so much fatigue, myalgia, and pain that she couldn&#39;t walk. She said she has a petechia rash, cramps, muscle spasms, dry skin and itching now. Reported she literally saved herself from dialysis by going to the hospital. She said she kept putting off her symptoms, and took Tylenol and Naproxen for the whole month of Jan2021. She said her symptoms started brewing up from day 1, clarifying that her symptoms were not really bad until 30Dec2020 and 31Dec2020. She clarified on 30Dec2020 she took Naproxen, Ibuprofen, and Tylenol for her symptoms, and nothing helped her. She said she knew her symptoms were not normal for her, and she went for the whole month of Jan2021 with her symptoms. She said finally there came a time when she said &#34;oh no, this is not normal at all&#34;, and she told herself she needed to check in at the hospital. She said she took Naproxen and Tylenol, and felt a little better, and drove herself to the hospital. Reported she kept walking and taking medicines, and while at work she diverted her mind from her symptoms, but when she came home she felt tired, and would tell herself she couldn&#39;t do it anymore. She said she doesn&#39;t know if what she experienced was from the COVID-19 Vaccine, but that definitely she had a reaction to either the Hepatitis A booster, the Shingrix Vaccine, or the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Reported she received 11 bags of Normal Saline (1000ml per bag) while she was in the hospital. She said fluid resuscitation was the only way to bring her CPK levels down and to treat the rhabdomyolysis. Reported her symptoms have improved. She said her last CPK was 134 on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. Reported she had cramps and severe muscle spams in her right leg on 17Feb2021, and then had cramps and muscle spasms in her left leg the following day. She said the cramps and muscle spams have not gone away completely. Reported she has a small petechia rash on her lower legs. She said at the moment the petechia rash shows up on her leg, she knows she is going to have a muscle spasm in that area. She said last night she had 2 petechia rashes show up on the lateral side of her right ankle. She said the petechia rash started to burn, and her right leg calf muscle became heavy. She said she could tell her right leg calf muscle was going to start to spasm, so she took some coconut oil and applied the coconut oil to her right leg calf muscle and massaged her right calf muscle. She said she had 2 areas of petechia last night (23Feb2021). She said the first time the petechia was noticed was when she went to the Emergency Room on 06Feb2021. She said the petechia has been persisting since that time. She said prior to being admitted to the hospital she never had dry skin or itching, but now she has dry skin and itching. She said she was using coconut oil to keep her skin moist. She stated she had 2 telehealth calls (11Feb2021 &amp; 18Feb2021) because of a petechia rash and muscle cramps and was asking her doctor is she may need to go back to the hospital. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work, CBC and Thyroid level on 06Jan2021 with unknown results (she had regular blood work done for her yearly checkup on 06Jan2021 (BMP, CBC, and Thyroid level). Also included CPK on 06Feb2021 greater than 2400, CPK on 09Feb2021 566 and CPK on 17Feb2021 134 (units were unspecified), She said her last CPK was 134 on Wednesday, 17Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of rhabdomyolysis, fatigue extreme/felt tired, myalgia, pain, muscle cramps/muscle spasms, her CPK was over 2400. Outcome of the event rhabdomyolysis, fatigue extreme/felt tired, myalgia, pain and her cpk was over 2400 was recovering. Outcome of petechia, muscle cramps/muscle spasms, dry skin and itching was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded. The Hepatitis A booster and the Shingrix Vaccine may have also played a contributory role. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient was noted to have abrupt respiratory failure 2 days after taking the 1st dose. The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute respiratory failure with hypoxemia secondary to acute CHF exacerbation. The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed 2 weeks prior to hospitalization that was noted to show a left ventricular ejection fraction of 60-65%. At the hospitalization, her left ventricular ejection fraction was noted to decrease to 25-30%. Left heart catheterization was performed and showed no signs of ischemic heart disease (coronary artery disease). Patient was started on Entresto 24/26mg PO BID and Toprol XL 50mg PO daily and was diuresed with Bumex 1mg IV daily and was noted to have improvement in respiratory symptoms for which she was weaned off of BiPAP 15/5 with FiO2 of 50% down to room air. Patient had repeat transthoracic echocardiogram ordered prior to discharge and was noted to have an improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction to 48% prior to discharge. The only change was that the patient had the COVID-19 vaccination. Patient does not have any history of coronary artery disease or heart failure. Patient was worked up extensively for other etiologies of heart failure and none were found.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol.

She struggled to recover following the surgeries and did not respond to her medications or the new device. She received her COVID vaccine on 3/15/21. No significant change following the vaccine but no improvement as expected as device settings and medications were titrated. We received a call from her husband that she died during the night of 4/1/21. She had seen her PCP on 3/31/21 without any concerns on vitals etc.

                                                April 22, 2021 morning my auntie got her first dose of Pfizer vaccine. She happily shared here vaccine experience with family member and relative.  April 23 morning, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced death right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  Reason of death given is &#34;septic shock secondary to ischemic bowel &amp; intra-abdominal sepsis&#34;.   But it is the blood clots issue that is causing it.   I was told that after my auntie got into hospital the very next day after Pfizer vaccine, hospital later found out that my auntie has blood blockage issue that is causing blood couldn&#39;t flow to her intestines. The acid in her blood was very high, 6&#43;.  After more than 6 hours without blood to her intestines, her intestines tissues start dying and turned black color. Doctor found out about this at the night of April 23, 2021 nighttime. April 22, 2021 morning is the day my auntie got her Pfizer covid vaccine.  There is a very high chances of the Pfizer vaccine is causing the blood clots that lead to blood blockages.

                                                stroke; face sunk in and changed/Bells Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Mar2021 at 14:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included a mild case of COVID-19, last year, on an unspecified date in 2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. On 21Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face sunk in and changed. The patient&#39;s symptoms were not improving. Her eye and right side of her face are affected. She cannot close her right eye. She worked on it and is now able to close right eye not like the left eye closes, but it doesn&#39;t blink as the left eye does. She has been using eye drops for this. She said it was Bells Palsy. The patient added that it is hard to look in the mirror. She will not get the second dose. She was not interested in taking the vaccine now.  She wanted to wait and see. It being so new and see. Her sister took it and encouraged her, and said it is necessary because they like to travel. She got Prednisone when she was at the hospital, they gave her 60mg Prednisone. Her physician didn&#39;t want to keep her on it too long and said it may cause other complications.  Her physician cut her off, she weaned her down 50mg, 40mg, 30mg, 20mg, then 10mg. When the patient noticed her face start to turn, she went to the ER. She thought she was having a stroke. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The outcome of the event face sunk in and changed/bells palsy was not recovered while the outcome of the event stroke was unknown.

A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Mar2021 09:40 (Lot Number: EN6199) (at the age of 65 years old) as single dose (dose 1) for COVID-19 immunisation; and methylprednisolone (MEDROL), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date at short term increase of the Medrol dose (as reported), from  unspecified date to an unspecified date at 2 mg (for four years, as reported), then from unspecified date to 10Mar2021 at 6 mg, then from 11Mar2021 to 13Mar2021 at 8 mg, then from 14Mar2021 to unspecified date at 6 mg, for Lupus. Medical history included diagnosed with asthma initially exercised induced and now it is seasonal and was diagnosed years ago (states she has not had to use her Albuterol inhaler that much now because it is seasonal but she is doing more outside and is allergic to outside things so she tends to use the inhaler more if needed), right leg paresthesia (she did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine), autoimmune disorder, thyroid disorder and patient stated that she has lost height. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for asthma; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) taken for thyroid disorder; paracetamol (TYLENOL); and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). The patient had a history of Lupus and is on maintenance Medrol 2mg for four years and before that she had a short-term increase of the Medrol dose with flares of her Lupus. She had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 1st dose and then three days later on 10Mar2021 at 16:00, she thought what is going on and had her tongue tip so irritated and a strange feeling that it was a tiny bit edematous, her lower lip was full tingling. She had mucoid eruption on her lower lip and saw then that the next day thought it was swollen but it wasn&#39;t swollen. She had eruption on her tongue, had a rash to her face, neck, chest, back, shoulders and thighs. The rash was dispersed and there is a red raised rash with Lupus called Livedo reticularis and that is usually on the thighs but this rash on her was below her thighs and came up and dispersed between all the same rash elsewhere on her body. The healthcare professionals were closed so she took increased Medrol steroids and her Albuterol inhaler and Benadryl; the Benadryl was thrown out and discarded so she has no lot number to provide for it, stated that the Benadryl was the pediatric dye free bubblegum free. The Albuterol Sulfate HFA inhaler is 90mcg per puff and she does two puffs every 6 hours as needed; she had not taken the inhaler but she has trouble with asthma and took the Albuterol inhaler now as preventative and needs to use the inhaler as of yesterday (lot Y23B with expiry date Dec2021). Patient stated that she has the tools of her Albuterol inhaler, the steroid Medrol and the Benadryl and the knowledge so she prevented the symptoms she was reporting from being life threatening but stated the reported events were a little disabling and medically significant.She had joint pain in her left arm and could not use her left arm and her whole entire arm and hand. She had left clavicle pain under the clavicle and knows this did occur in the random trials but for her it went away after two days and is now back regarding the pain. She has bright red palms and sole of her feet are bright red. The next morning on 11Mar2021, her upper lip was tingling and she did go see her healthcare professional in town and sent photos to her Rheumatologist. As time went on she had tingling in her hands and her entire body from her scalp to her soles was so irritated and prickly and her soles and palms were bright red; it looked like Kawasaki disease and she used to take care of children with Kawasaki disease. On Saturday which was the 3rd day she was on the Medrol 8mg and had the fight or flight cardiac symptom and she cut herself down on the Medrol on the next Sunday to 6mg which seemed to make her better. The redness was gone until she had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine 2nd dose yesterday and the healthcare professional initially said after her 1st dose of the vaccine to wait and see her rheumatologist do decided to do the increased Medrol dose of steroids and she stated she has got to get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine; the healthcare professional checked her lungs that were clear and her pulse ox was fine and she was not wheezing and she then went on increased steroids from Medrol 6mg to 8mg right away. She did have a right leg paresthesia and had that before the vaccine so she knows what it is like because she has issues with her spine but had not had the paresthesia in a long time. She increased to Medrol 8mg for the three days after the 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and got a flight or fight response. She had to increase the Medrol dose from 6mg and popped it up to 8mg and she had mucoid eruptions in her mouth, on her palate and down her throat and had a voice change. She has a laryngoscopy on Thursday (25Mar2021) with her ENT. She has pediatric doses of everything because she reacts to almost everything. The 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine was administered to her on 29Mar2021 09:45 with lot ER8732. Patient stated that anyone else would have gone to the emergency room but she took care of herself at home and knows the risk factors related to the vaccine. She absolutely felt the reported events were related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine in terms of causality and she never had these issues before. The rheumatologist had experience with patients with autoimmune diseases and stated people with autoimmune disease have a heightened immune reaction to the vaccine no matter which vaccine they get and are overly active and then a vaccine is thrown in there and we are charting new territory. The next Thursday or Friday over a week now after the Pfizer COVID Vaccine she had a multisystem type of thing and on 18th and 19th of March she started having episodes and was not doing anything but quietly doing something and had chest flutters and spontaneous cough where her heart races and felt she couldn&#39;t catch her breath and is now on a 30 day event monitor. She was not sure this is due to the Medrol steroids or the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She got her thyroid TSH level done because sometimes when the Synthroid dose needs to be lowered because it is too high for your body and you can have atrial flutter which she has had before in the past from her Synthroid dose being too high; states her Synthroid is 50mcg and takes it once per day by mouth and it is in a prescription bottle with no lot, expiry date or NDC. Patient saw her primary care physician again last Tuesday on 23Mar2021 and all the issues in her throat and neck area had something pressing around her throat and thought it was lymph nodes and woke up with a voice change and physician said he would take a look and he said it was not thrush and she would have to be scoped because he couldn&#39;t see in her throat. She had a referral for a CBC and Chemistry lab to be done on 25Mar2021 and TSH was in the usual range for her, the results from Thursday (25Mar2021) night had her BUN and creatinine and GSR (Glomerular filtration rate) abnormal. The rheumatologist called her that night and talked to the physician and said he considered this may be body inflammatory response to being vaccinated and could be that her kidneys were inflamed and she does not know as this is all new territory. For the kidney issues, the information was sent off to the rheumatologist who did orders and called the physician back the next day and she told him she thought she needed a nephrology consult and had urine chemistry, a urinalysis and looked for protein and did a blood draw for a chemistry screen with the following results on 25Mar2021: BUN 22.3, grade IIIa kidney failure, creatinine 1.28, eGSR-NAA 42ml/min, normal is over 60 and she usually runs 70 something. She went to the hospital over the years to have her chemistry lab done because she has Lupus and over the last two years she has never been below 60 for the eGSR-NAA. On 26Mar2021, she repeated the blood work and sent everything to her physician and the CMP had her BUN still elevated at 19.5, the creatinine was down to 0.97 and the eGSR-NAA was up to 58mL/min which is still abnormal; the urinalysis was all fine with no white cells and no leukocytes and no protein; the urine chemistry had the creatine of 8.5, the protein in the urine LVL was less than 0.4mg. Her CBC had her lymphs and monos down and she would expect having this response to the vaccine. Both physician called her on the weekend and they were concerned this came out of nowhere and now are monitoring her again in a month; her physician and rheumatologist both were entertaining this could be related to the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She does not take vaccines because of what they do to the body and did take the flu vaccine in Oct2020. She was covid negative (unspecified date) and stated had to be screened on Friday 26Mar2021 before her laryngoscopy and did the PCR test and only does the PCR. States she was doing research and had conflicting information from her physician and rheumatologist who she first saw her physician, after her 1st dose of the vaccine and the rheumatologist talked about increasing her steroids and she told him she was so tired and how with increased steroids, do steroids impact the effectiveness of the covid vaccine being blunt immune suppressants. Physician said long term chronic steroids have no effect on the effectiveness of the vaccine. She has no had headaches, shaky chills like everybody else has because she is on immune suppressants and has an article that says some evidence for steroids diminishing efficacy in Pfizer COVID Vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional Vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Events required a visit to physician office (No visit to the ER but did see her physician). The last action taken in response to the events for methylprednisolone was unknown.

He was treated according to sepsis protocol including antibiotics for bacterial infection for pulmonary infiltrates however it was felt the pulmonary infiltrates are more related with COVID-19 pulmonary findings. Eliquis was started for DVT. Medical Center had been contacted Dr was the pulmonary attending and discussion is documented below- Attending hospitalist spoke to Dr from Medical Center.  At this point they know that she has Wegener&#39;s granulomatosis involving her kidneys and causing her renal failure but they do not think that is what is going on in her lungs.  They have still trying to work-up her infiltrates.  She has it we obtain a nocturnal oximetry study.  She was reassured that the patient is on her normal oxygen rate despite the DVT in her leg.  She feels this should rule out a pulmonary embolism.  If the patient is doing well from cardiopulmonary standpoint tomorrow she should be able to go home on Eliquis and follow-up with the specialist.   She was continued on Monistat cream for 3 nights total.   At this point patient will not require antibiotics will continue on Decadron and may be discharged to follow-up with her specialist.

Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient.   CT angiogram chest pulmonary embolism with and without contrast   Result Date: 4/22/2021 CTA CHEST PULMONARY EMBOLISM W WO CONTRAST IMPRESSION: No evidence of pulmonary embolus or right heart strain. Extensive parenchymal consolidation in both lungs, left greater than right consistent with severe pneumonia such as Covid 19 pneumonia. Moderate left-sided small to moderate right sided pleural effusions are seen with associated compressive atelectasis. Enlarged main pulmonary artery which can be seen in the setting of chronic pulmonary hypertension. Interval development of large mediastinal adenopathy particularly in the right paratracheal region and subcarinal region. These may be reactive in nature in the setting of as diffuse pneumonia. Enterogastric tube with the tip extending to just within the stomach. END OF IMPRESSION: INDICATION: pneumonia. Assess for pulmonary artery embolism. TECHNIQUE:  Enhanced helical CT scan of the chest was performed from the lung apices to below the diaphragm. 2mm axial reconstruction with MPR coronal, oblique and sagittal images were created. 3D shaded surface images also created on a separate workstation and permanently stored.   CONTRAST:  100mL of IOHEXOL 350 MG IODINE/ML INTRAVENOUS SOLUTION administered INTRAVENOUS. Quality of contrast opacification was adequate. COMPARISON: July 22, 2013 FINDINGS: Lung windows demonstrate extensive consolidation involving the lungs, left greater than right. There is a moderate left-sided effusion and a small to moderate right sided effusion with associated compressive atelectasis. The trachea and bronchi are grossly unremarkable. No endobronchial lesions are seen. Soft tissue windows demonstrate a grossly unremarkable thoracic inlet. The thyroid is unremarkable. Moderate bilateral axillary lymph nodes are seen with extensive bulky adenopathy in the mediastinum to include the right paratracheal region as well as the subcarinal region and to a lesser extent the hila. The largest lymph nodes are seen in the paratracheal chain demonstrating short axis of approximately 15 mm. Smaller lymph nodes are seen in the aortopulmonary window. These may be reactive in nature. The heart demonstrates a normal configuration. No right heart enlargement is seen. No pericardial effusion is seen. The thoracic aorta and great vessels demonstrate normal branching pattern. Normal course and caliber is seen. The pulmonary arteries demonstrate normal course. There is moderate dilation of the main pulmonary artery up to 3.2 cm. This can be seen in the setting of chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension. No filling defects are seen. Enterogastric tube is seen with the distal tip extending to just within the proximal stomach. The visualized portions of the upper abdomen are grossly unremarkable. The surrounding osseous structures demonstrate mild degenerative changes of the thoracic spine.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9269, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 (at the age of 65-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Hodgkin&#39;s disease, Alopecia, Alopecia areata, Asthma, Back pain, Heartburn, Pulmonary embolism. The patient previously took Diltiazem and experienced allergic reaction. Concomitant medications included biotin (BIOTIN) taken for alopecia, finasteride (FINASTERIDE) taken for alopecia areata, hair fall; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) taken as a supplement, calcium (CALCIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for an unspecified indication, albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) taken for asthma, clobetasol propionate (CLOBETASOL PROPIONATE) topical solution that I put in my scalp for my alopecia, tramadol hydrochloride (ULTRAM [TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE]) as Occasionally taken for back pain, lorazepam (LORAZEPAM) taken for PRN, for sleeping at night, rivaroxaban (XARELTO) Strength:20 mg taken for pulmonary embolism, esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM [ESOMEPRAZOLE SODIUM]) as PRN taken for Heart burn, levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE) I take that because my thyroid was killed after radiation from having Hodgkin&#39;s disease cancer, Docusate sodium with Senna (DOCUSATE SODIUM &amp; SENNA) taken for an unspecified indication. It was also reported that the patient took, unspecified steroid injection in scalp for Alopecia. It was reported that, &#34;I received the COVID-19 Vaccine on 09Jan2021 and the second one on 29Jan2021 Lot number EN6198 and about two weeks, let me go back to my calendar about four day after the first one I had my oral surgery on an unspecified date in Jan2021 and the next, they gave me a narcotic, Norco for pain. I took four of them and it was making me sick, so I stop taking it. The next day I didn&#39;t feel well at all. I actually felt like I was through Pulmonary embolism and I have a history of that (Consumer was unsure hence, Pulmonary embolism was not captured as event). So, I called doctor&#39;s office, it was closed so we messaged him and Monday he called and said you are on blood thinners you are not going through PE, I think you have been through a lot with the COVID-19 Vaccine then you had oral surgery and here you took Norco and he just said, just let your body rest, so I try to feel better in the next few weeks. The next time I saw a doctor I mentioned this to her that was on 10Feb2021 and it was a dermatologist that I see for alopecia areata (History) and I told her I am having shortness of breath on an unspecified date and lot of fatigue and she said that could be related to the COVID-19 Vaccine, you need to report that and I thought okay, you know she said you need time to get to your doctor. I said, I did, And he told me that it wasn&#39;t PE I just need to give my body time to recover from everything. She said (withheld) something is going on, shortness of breath and the fatigue that you are having doesn&#39;t sound right. She looked, the next day she called me at home and she looked up some stuff on COVID-19 and she said I really think you should report this and you really need to call the doctor now. So, I called the pulmonologist so again he didn&#39;t want to see me, he said you are not going through PE and you need to see cardiologist. So next week I had an appointment with the cardiologist on 19Feb2021. They said I was in A-fib on an unspecified date and they put me on cardiac medications you know to try and to get me medically to convert back into sinus rhythm and that was in February. In March I had an allergic reaction to Diltiazem they switched me to Metoprolol and then two and half months later I was still in A-fib, they sent me to electrophysiologist and Monday I had a cardio version done and so since then I see the dermatologist again for my alopecia and she said, did you ever contacted Covid or you know Pfizer you know you got that paper, when you got the vaccine they give you piece of paper that had phone number on it, I really think you need to let them know everything that happened and its all been since COVID-19 Vaccine. So I am just reporting what I have been through and by the way I am in sinus rhythm now but I am still having symptoms shortness of breath and fatigue. I messaged my doctor yesterday and I am waiting for a response from the electrophysiologist to find out you know why, when I am out of A-fib why I am still having the same symptoms. I take Metoprolol (treatment) because I was in A-fib they are trying to medically convert me and right now my dose has been tapered because I am back in sinus rhythm. So in a month I will be off of it. &#34;Consumer further stated, &#34;No, I just wanted you guys to be aware because my one doctor really insisted that I should call you. I mean I don&#39;t know if the Covid-19 vaccine has anything to do with all this or not I am just letting you know as a courtesy. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included EKG: unknown result on an unspecified date in Dec2020, EKG: unknown result on an unspecified date in Mar2021 (echo my ejection fraction was 55% and labs were done like in December because then I will have my annual physical done). The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the known safety profile of the vaccine BNT162B2 ,a temporal association between the event atrial fibrillation and administration of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.  Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 65-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 05May2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The cancer doctor told her that she needed a Covid vaccine since she has cancer and a lowered immune system. Medical history included Metastatic rectal cancer from Jul2019 to 17May2021, Osteoporosis from unknown date to 17May2021 (She had it for maybe 10 years or something), Fibromyalgia from unknown date to 17May2021 (She had the fibromyalgia for 20 years). She had rectal cancer, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, and a couple other things that the caller can&#39;t think of off hand. Her mother was diagnosed with the rectal cancer in Jul2019. The caller has no idea when she was diagnosed with the osteoporosis. She had the fibromyalgia for 20 years, and the caller is sure it was the same for the osteoporosis, maybe 10 years or something. They were being managed. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient did have metastatic rectal cancer, but it was managed. She was not on hospice or terminal, and they hadn&#39;t exhausted all of the treatment plans yet. It was being controlled. She was under the surveillance of a cancer doctor who was completely shocked by her sudden death. It seemed like there was no reason. She was fine and drove herself to her appointments all the time. She had just driven herself to her last appointment. She passed away yesterday morning. She was slowly declining since she got the vaccine. The coroner was playing guessing games and assumed it was pancreatic cancer. Well, she didn&#39;t have pancreatic cancer, and the doctor already said the cancer didn&#39;t kill her. The doctor said if he had to guess it could have been some kind of pneumonia or a reaction to the vaccine. All of it made her heart stop. The coroner couldn&#39;t get the city to approve an autopsy to see the real cause of death because there was no foul play. The caller took it upon herself to discover if maybe Pfizer could help, and she needs to alleviate the vaccine as an option if it contributed. She is so tired and hasn&#39;t slept. It is devastating. This woman was everything in her life, and the caller is probably going to go next with how she feels. She feels responsible. Her other guess is if she gave her mother Covid and she slowly declined with pneumonia. The caller couldn&#39;t get her sister to take her mother to the ER. Her sister was there Sunday night. On Monday morning her sister called to say her mother was gone. On 05May2021 the patient had the first dose of the Covid vaccine. The caller could have gone there or called an ambulance when her mother wasn&#39;t answering the phone. She knew something was wrong. She called her sister who said their mother wasn&#39;t feeling good. Her mother was woozy, dizzy, and sleeping all the time. On day 3, Sunday, the caller couldn&#39;t get her mother on the phone. She thought she had some level of peace because her sister was there and could keep her updated. Her mother often gets sickly, but she always answers the phone even if she is deathly sick. The caller thought enough is enough and she needed to be put on the phone on speaker with her mother. The caller&#39;s sister said her mother was sleeping. The doctor said to probably bring her mother to the ER. The caller told her sister who just didn&#39;t take her mother to the ER. The caller could have called an ambulance. She feels incompetent. They are assuming the cause of death was a heart attack. If her mother had gone to the ER on Sunday night they may have found out. Her mother became woozy last weekend because the caller was there on Thursday and her mother didn&#39;t look good. She had her chemo bag because she brings it home. It was her first new chemo treatment, and the caller had never seen her mother respond like this. It was strange. Any other time when she was getting chemo she felt great because there is so much stuff in there like steroids to prevent a reaction. It was surprising because she was only sick on chemo once and she had been on this one before. She was just off. Then she continued to decline from there. It started before the chemo. She got on chemo that Thursday before Mother&#39;s Day, she was on her first chemo treatment at that time. She was sick a couple of days before that. She had the chemo on 06May2021. She started feeling sickly the day she got the injection on 05May2021. When the caller was there she was thinking it was from the chemo. The caller calls her mother every day and she was sounding worse and worse. On Thursday 13May2021 her mother took herself to her chemo follow up appointment and was telling the doctor that she was woozy, dizzy, and not eating. The doctor gave her fluids, and he didn&#39;t give her chemo because she was not scheduled for it that day. It was just a follow up appointment. He sent her home. The caller talked to her mother on Thursday evening and she didn&#39;t sound good and told her she was woozy and dizzy. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday she didn&#39;t answer the phone. The caller&#39;s mother is totally against vaccines, and she had been begged to get the pneumonia and flu vaccine and denied them. She had never responded well to them in her life. Even as a cancer patient they would say she needed it and she wouldn&#39;t. She did get the Covid vaccine even though she didn&#39;t want to. The caller thought her mother was trying to convince herself it was because of the vaccine because she is so against them, but now she doesn&#39;t know. The doctor said he didn&#39;t think it would have been Covid because she didn&#39;t have a fever. Her mother told her that she had been running a fever off and on, which is not unusual for her mother. The doctor didn&#39;t think it would have been Covid. Her mother started sleeping all the time mid week last week. She started not eating at the end of last week. The caller has no idea when her mother had a fever. She hadn&#39;t gotten to talk to her mother all weekend. At some point last week her mother had said in a conversation that she had a fever off and on. Then on Thursday when she went to the chemo doctor she had no fever it shows it was 97 something. Her oxygen was fine. Her blood pressure was a bit low, 105 over something, which is low for her. She didn&#39;t have a fever last Thursday. Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks no other vaccinations. Blood work on 13May2021 with unknown result. The patient passed away on 17May2021 after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine. The caller expresses concern that her mother may have had Covid. No autopsy done. Cause of death was Heart attack.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart attack

Her psych doctor thought maybe the vaccine could have triggered this type of reaction. She gained consciousness and was sent to a rehab nursing home where she&#39;s learning to walk to feed herself and getting stronger now that she&#39;s home. There&#39;s a long road to recovery.

I went to doctor and was treated for Aneixty.   My symptoms got worst went back to doctor and hospital er.   While in the emergency room I was diagnosed w a pulmonary embolism.   Never had this no famil issues w blood clots.  I was hospitalize for 4 days and put on blood thinners   I am still suffering from shortness of breath and panic attacks.  I also lost 22 pounds in less than a month based on not being able to eat.  This was a nightmare. I feel sure this was a side affect of the COVID shot no one cared to share the risk.  This needs to be documented and reported I?m sure there are others.

                                                The next day that evening, I started to make a squeaky wheeze.  I woke up feeling  extremely short of breath. I was unable to walk even a few feet without feeling SOB.  I called my doctor and did a virtual visit. I was prescribed antibiotics and steroid pack (Methylprednisolone) for possible pneumonia. On 3/15/2021, I was still feeling horrible and was instructed to go to ER and was admitted for 3 days.  The did blood work (normal) and X-ray of lungs which showed fluids in lungs. I was put IV of Lasix to get rid of fluids. When I was discharged with a diagnosis of heart failure and to follow up with my cardiologist who did an ECHO and stress test- it showed reduced ef rate of 25.  I still have continuing heart issues and on new medications- Lasix and Entresto.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; anaphylactic reaction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8733; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 29Mar2021 08:00 (at age of 65 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included She has had idiopathic anaphylaxis in the past Started around 2015. No Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks), She is immune suppressed. Concomitant drug included: a monochromial injection that wipes out all of her eosinophils. She takes it every 8 weeks. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6189, Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) on 04Mar2021 (at 64 years old) at left arm as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Antibody testing is not recommended to assess for immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following COVID-19 vaccination because the clinical utility of post-vaccination testing has not been established. Experts are currently evaluating how COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results. If an immune response develops the goal of vaccination is a possibility of on antibody tests. Antibody tests indicate a previous infection and there may be some level of protection against the virus. Caller states she received the second dose of the vaccine, had an anaphylactic reaction, and was treated with steroids, and Benadryl. She is calling about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. After the second dose of the COVID vaccine, she had an anaphylactic reaction. Her question is, since she had to get IV steroids and stuff, is the dose still effective. If she needs a booster, she doesn&#39;t think she can get it. She thinks that a report has already been done by the physicians at the facility, but she is not sure. Anaphylactic reaction: She was sent to the hospital by ambulance. On the way to the hospital she received IV Benadryl, and Epi. She cannot remember if they gave her steroids there or at the hospital. She knows she received steroids in the ambulance. Confirms she was not admitted to the hospital. Adverse Event was Anaphylactic reaction. Time of Onset: Provides time as started 30 minutes after she received the second dose of the COVID vaccine. Reporter seriousness for Anaphylactic reaction: Life threatening. AE requires a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome of the events was recovered on 29Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information in the case, the causal association between the events anaphylactic reaction, disease recurrence and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Approximately 2 hours after her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, patient began to feel right arm numbness and tingling in her hand. This progressed to right leg numbness, tingling and weakness and right lower face tingling. Patient denied any facial droop, slurred speech, confusion or dizziness. Patient reports that symptoms peaked the night of the vaccine around 9 or 10pm and had gotten better but not totally resolved.  She was advised to go to the ER and was admitted.  MRI showed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia. CTA showed &#34;short segment moderately severe narrowing of the M1 segment of the right MCA.&#34;  Neurologist was consulted and determined it to be coincidental that the patient had her COVID vaccine the same day.

Died in her sleep after complaining of a headache. I talked to her around 5pm on sunday through a videochat and she seemed happy and well. But a local friend commented that she had complained of a headache late in the afternoon.

Once it stopped itching the rash turned in to what looked like a burn mark and the skin starting tearing and bleeding. I?ve been wearing a bandaid and I still have the mark today (1 week later), although it is slowly going away.

                                                2 days after vaccination right thighs and right leg started to have pain similar to pain I got with polymyalgia rheumatica that I have had in past and I though it was a flare up. A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

                                                large knot right above the injection site/size of a half dollar/size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot/like egg under the skin or clot; felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore; swelling started almost immediately after the shot/swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area/about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high; thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 66-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EM9810, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left deltoid on 01Feb2021 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization at a Physician office. Medical history included asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, pneumonia and borderline high cholesterol. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had her first COVID-19 vaccine on 01Feb2021 and second one is due on 22Feb2021. On 03Feb2021, the patient had a headache, but didn&#39;t think too much because it is a side effect. The headache lasted all through the weekend. Visual disturbances began 04Feb2021. She called her doctor on Monday and was seen by her doctor on Tuesday, 09Feb2021. The patient was referred to the eye center. Her headache was getting a little better. On 10Feb2021, the patient was seen at an institution, her retina and macula looked good, so she was referred to the ED. The patient was told she probably had a stroke. The patient was admitted to the hospital for an ischemic stroke. By looking at the MRI, the onset of the ischemic stroke would have been five to seven days prior, placing the onset on Wednesday, 03Feb2021, which was also the onset of her headache. There is no definitive cause of her ischemic stroke. The patient currently has an arrhythmia monitor on. MRI/MRA showed her vessels looked good. MRI showed evidence of the ischemic stroke. The patient has neurologists since being admitted to the hospital. It was thought that the headache was just because of the COVID-19 Vaccine. Causality was unknown, it was stated that they haven&#39;t found anything else as a cause. The patient&#39;s doctor stated she was borderline for high cholesterol. She was not hypertensive, but supposedly is now. The patient also had echocardiogram, EKG, manual neuro checks, and blood work but does not have the results. The outcome of the events was unknown. The has trouble reading now since the stroke.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the reported events are assessed as unrelated to the vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent or underlying medical conditions in this elderly patient with excessive weight (BMI=29) and underlying elevated cholesterol.

A 66 years old female patient (weight: 107.95 kg, height: 165 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the left arm, on 04Mar2021, at 16:50, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included atrial fibrillation from Jan2016 and ongoing and cardiac ablation on an unspecified date, in Feb2020 (she had her 2nd ablation in Feb2020, since then she has had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation. She stated prior to the second vaccine she had been in normal sinus rhythm for 8 days). Patient stated that she had a sister who had an arrhythmia problem. The patient previously, on 10Feb2021, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) in the left arm, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient stated that she had no problem with first dose. The patient received concomitant medications (unspecified). On 04Mar2021, at 21:00, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation and on 04Mar2021 she was tired. On 05Mar2021, she developed pain in the left arm. The patient recovered from pain in arm on 05Mar2021, from tiredness on 07Mar2021, while did not recover from atrial fibrillation.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

                                                phlebitis in my Right leg; small blood clot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 09Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included many allergies. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had other medications in two weeks but no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously had the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9263) on 20Jan2021 at 10:00 administered in the right arm for Covid-19 immunization. On 20Feb2021 at 12:00 (also reported as &#34;in February&#34;), the patient had a phlebitis in her right leg, a week later (Feb2021) a vascular surgeon office did an ultrasound and found a small blood clot. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The events were treated with Eliquis BID (twice a day) for 45 days. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal relationship between BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the event thrombosis cannot be excluded based on temporal association.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate .

The patient experienced blood clot in her right ankle, varicose vein in her right ankle and it started to hurt, ankle on her right side started swelling, all on an unknown date. All events caused patient physician office visit. Treatment received for all events. It is reported that she is calling about the Covid 19 vaccine. She wanted to report that she developed a blood clot in her right ankle. She went to the doctor yesterday on 06Apr2021. She would like to add she has no prior history of any type of blood issues. The doctor she saw thought that the blood clot and the Covid 19 vaccine could be related but would not commit to saying so directly. She started having issues about 6 days after the second Covid 19 vaccine. She doesn&#39;t exactly remember when, maybe the 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. She ignored the issues attributing them to over exercising. She reached a point where she couldn&#39;t ignore the issues anymore and went to the doctor. Caller clarifies she has a varicose vein in her right ankle and it started to hurt then her ankle on her right side started swelling. She only payed attention to her ankle when it got worse. The last 3 weeks have been awful. She would like it known that she does not lead a sedimentary lifestyle. She rides her bike 60 miles a week and walks 10 miles a week. She&#39;s always moving. This is unusual for her. The doctor she saw diagnosed her with a blood clot and he did a sonogram in his office. She has been prescribed Xarelto 15mg tablets. Take 2 tablets twice daily for the first 21 days then on the 22nd day start taking one 20mg tablet once daily. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sonogram: unknown result on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the all events was unknown.

A 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN8208) at the age f 66 years old as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Jan2021, (Lot Number: EL9264) in the right arm at the age of 66 for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient reported that she began having signs and symptoms on 29Mar2021; heavy weight in throat like there was a softball in her throat; pressure in that area when she bent over; chest tightness; difficulty breathing; a lot of chest pain; chest stiffness; sharp stabbing pain in upper left chest. The patient stated that it took 13 days and 2 trips to the ER and multiple Doctor calls before they could diagnose what was wrong. She had visited her general doctor who thought she had an embolism and sent her to the Emergency Room on her second visit. They did a D-Dimer test, which they hadn&#39;t done on her first Emergency Room visit. The patient was diagnosed with pericardial effusion tamponade on 08Apr2021 as confirmed with the echocardiogram performed on 09Apr2021. On 09Apr2021 they removed the fluid, 700cc of blood, surrounding her heart. The patient was in the ICU from 08Apr2021 to 16Apr2021.

The patient reported that she has some mild symptoms, residual symptoms, some pain in chest and some tightness, but it was much better now. She had an echocardiogram a week after getting out of the hospital which showed no fluid now. The patient was placed on medication. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                get sore arm; Anaphylactic reaction; Shortness of breath; look miserable; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 09May2021 (Lot Number: EW0177; Expiration Date: Aug2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma since she was 8 years old, when she was a child her asthma was really bad and then she would say after 2004, she would say she went to chemotherapy and then 2005 her asthma got a lot better, didn&#39;t have it really bad as she used to, one doctor said he had heard that from patient they go through the chemo and their immune system change, she carried her little inhaler, but she don&#39;t have (incomplete sentence), she had asthma but not really bad, she was not like walking around every day with asthma packs but she have asthma and she keep little inhaler, for eg; if there is lot of pollen in air then she will need to take out her inhaler; breast cancer; seizure; hypertension, high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included zonisamide taken for seizure, lacosamide (VIMPAT) taken for seizure, losartan taken for hypertension, atorvastatin taken for high cholesterol, all start and stop date were not reported. Some years ago when she in 2005 when she was on the end like she said its 2005 and she was right on the end of being treated for breast cancer. she was taking, the doctor put her on Tamoxifen and she woke up one morning to really short of her breath and she thought it was her asthma, so the lady she was staying with said you look miserable and she said let her get back on the store and have her take her to the ER she said call now and it turned she had a blood clot in her lungs but &#39;Dr PRIVACY&#39; (not spelled) who was treating her, he was a cancer specialist he said PRIVACY she was so proud of her, he said that she got to take you off the Tamoxifen, it was that Tamoxifen that caused blood clot in your lung. A blood clot in the lungs was the side effect of the Tamoxifen. Tamoxifen was one of the drug they give women who have had breast cancer and are right at the end of the treatment and put us on Tamoxifen and she ended up with a little bit of blood clot in her lungs. He said that was one of the effects of Tamoxifen. So, that was like in 2008, 2009 it was 12 years ago, could have 11 years ago but this goes to show her body may have potency for allergic reaction. The patient stated she had short of her breath because she did have allergic reaction shortness of breath with Pfizer Vaccine first dose at a pharmacy yesterday 09May2021, had been given Prednisone so. She did shortness of breath about 45 minutes after she took it because we had to sit there about she would say we were sitting there about 20 minutes and he finally said well you all can get up and leave and then about say 15 minutes later she start getting shorter and shorter of her breath. &#34; The patient stated, she just needed to Pfizer certainly reporting acting as if this was just a completely safe vaccine there are unsafe reaction to this vaccine so she wanted to get this going okay, she was 66 years old she end up going to the ER,  they didn&#39;t give her Epipen&#39; (not clarified further) so that&#39;s when she started to get sore arm, she had an anaphylactic reaction to this drug. Now if this was the wrong number to report it to then she would call to get to agency she needed to report it to. she was on the Prednisone now. Sometimes it was difficult for she to breathe, so the emergency room they &#39;have&#39; (not clear) she up with enough medication now, so she had got plenty of medication now.&#34; She stated it just happened yesterday, when she saw on the news that they hadapproved it to be for children and it bothers me that they, this was  just a break simple drug no very safe. Yesterday when she  first started getting short of her breath she was in denial and didn&#39;t want to because she was really started shorter of my breath and the pharmacist that administered he even said he knew that it was the reaction to the drug because she was full animated before he administered the vaccine because she  was sitting there talking to the two ladies and you know jabbering and remember the days because of flu shots and how the government used it, they didn&#39;t wanted knowledge when people talked about how the flu shot (Unspecified Shot) made them sick and she  was just jabbering so he knew it was reaction to the vaccine. Here was this lady &#39;who was so animated and talking and now she can barely hold her head up&#39; (not clarified further). Patient confirmed Prednisone as treatment. As for the treatment patient stated, &#34;Took the 2 Prednisone and what happened was, if I wasn&#39;t even going to go get Prednisone, but the shortness of breath was going transient, what I mean is first of all I talk and I do fine and then all of a sudden I get short of my breath again and then looked like I had a good night and then I woke up and my lungs tightened up again and then earlier this evening I called on phone and tell them I have to take Prednisone because my breath was getting short again.&#34; Prednisone details were 10 mg 4 tablet by mouth every day for 5 days then 2 tablet every day for 3 days, so 1 every day for 2 days. As for other medications: patient stated she was on seizure medications daily. She was on treatment for asthma, she had a little inhaler she keep in her purse for eg; if there&#39;s pollen in the air, when she got out and then maybe get short of her breath if there&#39;s pollen in the air yeah she need her little inhaler, but she was on daily treatment for her seizures she was on 800 mg a day for the seizures, Zonisamide and Vimpat. In fact that day she wouldn&#39;t take any other medication because she thought well she was not taking any other medication&#39; (not clarified further) to mix it with this vaccine. Normally she take the 25 mg for high blood pressure but she won&#39;t take it that day she think it&#39;s called Losartan or something. Little bit of high blood pressure they cut that down because her blood pressure had gotten, she had some high blood pressure yes it&#39;s called 25 mg of Losartan. Yeah she thought, she won&#39;t take it that morning because she though well just lay off all of that stuff that day and so we can take the vaccine, &#39;mix none of that with vaccine&#39; (not clear), that day the only medication that she was taking was her seizure medication (Zonisamide and Vimpat) because you can&#39;t skip medication but the Losartan and Atorvastatin that&#39;s for high cholesterol she won&#39;t take that either that day. The asthma now, she did have asthma but it&#39;s a kind of that&#39;s one the things that you have it but you are not on daily medication for it. She do keep her inhaler with because sometimes she go in buildings where they have air condition on really high and it gets to her lungs. In fact when this happened and the guy wanted to call 911 we decide well let&#39;s see if new inhaler (Unspecified Medication) worked and it wasn&#39;t quite rescuing her lungs like it should.&#34; For Vimpat details patient stated, it&#39;s a pill (formulation not clarified further), it&#39;s 100 mg so she took one in the morning and one in the evening. For Zonisamide details patient stated, Each capsule was 100 mg, so she take two 100 in the morning and two 100 before she go to bed.&#34; As for lab Test patient sated, &#34;Just had a MRI but no dye just the plain MRI with no dye or anything. Had MRI without dye, no dye.&#34; hen probed for the MRI result, consumer stated, &#34;No because this was the seizure doctor ordering that.&#34; As for date of MRI patient stated, &#34;That was on the 4th I think, but what was the MRI have to do with having a reaction to this vaccine, because the MRI. Doctor want specifically had no dyes it was just no dyes but that was the doctors that treat me for seizure he wanted the MRI done, yeah this was the 4th of May.&#34; When probed if adverse events are improved, worsened or persisting, consumer stated, &#34;today you know just a short of the breath I am really short of my breath but now when I have taken the Prednisone I am breathing a lot better, breathing so much better yes, you can mark improve (not clarified further).&#34; The outcome of the event shortness of breath was recovering, of other events was not recovered.

Course also complicated by saddle submassive PE w/ &#43; biomarkers and mild RHS.  Given unclear etiology of thrombocytopenia, venous thrombosis, and PE, suspect a precipitating/underlying etiology and cannot rule out possible occult malignancy, autoimmune disorder or alternative hypercoagulable state such as APLS. Possibly bacteremic given GPB and Staph on blood cx, though likely contaminant. DKA resolved, anion gap is closed, continued monitoring of glucose and insulin adjustment .OB/Gyn following for heavy vaginal bleeding and possibly gyn malignancy workup, endometrial biopsy pending.

A 66-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 12May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0172) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included amlodipine; insulin lispro (HUMALOG), empagliflozin, linaglipin, metformin hcl (TRIJARDY XR) and lovastatin all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 on unspecified date for Covid-19 immunization. On 15May2021, 2 days after vaccine administration, it was reported that the patient&#39;s body reacted to the vaccine. The side effect which the patient got was in the form of rashes and those rash become swollen and her face become swollen and is very itching and very painful, her lips become swollen. The daughter went to almost all doctors in urgent care and they are giving basically allergy medication but the allergy medications that they are giving is making worse. And the doctor says this is new for them so they don&#39;t know why her body is reacting to the vaccine like this. The patient was administered with treatment medications which includes Prednisone, Pepcid, Benadryl, Claritin, she also got Solu-Medrol, which the daughter reported was making the events worse and now the doctors ae not doing anything. Because the patient was given steroids her sugar and WBC came up. The daughter also reported she is bleeding so much of bleeding from there. The patient underwent blood test on 15May2021, 16May2021 and 17May2021 which were normal. The outcome of the events was unknown.

(Mfr. Control No.: 21K-163-3889347 -00).  A 66-years-old female received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number and expiry date were unknown) via intramuscularly on 03Mar2021 (at age of 66-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation and adalimumab (HUMIRA, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen) via subcutaneous route at 40mg/ 0.4ml (daily dose: 1, Citrate free: 40 mg, 1 in 2 week) for moderate to severe chronic plaque, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ongoing since Jan2019. Medical history included heart disease, high blood pressure, slightly elevated cholesterol level from 2005, supplement, cartilage disease, thyroid disease, anxiety, tobacco use, one pack of cigarettes (from 1966 to 2016), recurrent difficulty in sleeping since 1971, alcohol use from 1971, one glass of wine a glass of bourbon from 1972), recurrent joint pain from 2005 and rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) and clopidogrel both for heart disease; metoprolol and lisinopril for high blood pressure; atorvastatin for cholesterol; clobetasol via topical route, methotrexate, ibuprofen and omeprazole for an unspecified indication; folic acid and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D3) both as supplement; glucosamine for cartilage disease; levothyroxine for thyroid disease and naproxen for anxiety. Patient had previously received first dose of vaccine (lot number and expiration date were unknown) via intramuscularly on 17Feb2021, and on same day experienced light headed/ dizziness and recovered on 19Feb2021. On 28Apr2021, patient had heart attack and get&#39;s weak easily/ weakness. On 29Apr2021, patient had Coronary artery occlusion. On 28Apr2021, the patient was hospitalized for three days due to heart attack. On 29Apr2021 angioplasty procedure was performed and stent was laced that her artery was 99 percent blocked. She also stated that her heart muscle did not show any damage. She was monitored her electrocardiogram after the procedure and was given blood thinners, blood pressure medication and medication for cholesterol. She was scheduled for a follow up with her cardiologist on 26May2021. She was also advised do cardiac rehabilitation for 12 weeks. The alternate etiology as per the reporter for the event slightly elevated cholesterol level was weight. The alternate etiology as per the reporter for the event light headed and dizziness was COVID-19 vaccination. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 Vaccine Trial. Blood cholesterol test was performed in Apr2021 and result was 130. The reporter&#39;s causality for the events of cardiac artery blocked and get&#39;s weak easily was not provided. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of heart attack and light headed/dizziness with adalimumab (HUMIRA) 40mg/0.4ml was no reasonable possibility. The opinion was that there was no reasonable possibility that the events of cardiac artery blocked, heart attack, get&#39;s weak easily and light headed/dizziness are related to adalimumab (HUMIRA) 40mg/0.4ml. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab (HUMIRA) was unknown. The outcome for event weakness was resolving and for light headed/ dizziness was resolved on 19Feb2021, coronary artery occlusion and heart attack was resolved on 30Apr2021.  Causality for Covid-19 Vaccine  For Coronary artery occlusion  Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Not assessable For heart attack Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Not Related For weakness Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Not Related For dizziness  Causality as per reporter (Drug/Vaccine): Probable  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

                                                A week after the first dose, I started to have a pain in the distal part of the tongue, at this time I thought  it was just a beginning of a canker sore, gradually I feel a small painful blue mass. I went to see a Dr. he suggested a surgery.  I consulted an ENT doctor who concluded for surgery to target a histological type of the tongue lesion. The surgery takes place on June 09 2021.The histological study showed a lesion embedded in a streaked muscular tissue, it is a partly thrombosed vascular lesion with endothelial capillaries. Conclusion: This lesion of cystic appearance embedded in the lingual muscle corresponds to an organized thrombus.

I was  given epinephrine and prednisone  immediately for anaphylaxis. They reacted immediately upon my arrival. Time I unsure. I just say thank God for them.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

                                                I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She received the first round of the vaccine (Pfizer/EL9269) on 2/18/21. That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

The patient previously had first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication includes supplements and multivitamins. The patient stated &#34;I wanted to ask you and I have some horrible concerns I got my second COVID shot last Friday, and by Saturday night, I am not exaggerating, my symptoms were so severe I felt like I was going to die I mean literally die on 20Mar2021. I couldn&#39;t get to emergency room, I figured out I am just going to die, I just laid down and let my door open down so somebody could find me, the symptoms I was having was extreme nausea, chills, headache, the chest pain was horrible, horrible, the headache I mean I thought I am going to have a stroke, the joint and muscle pain were so severe. So I have been taking Tylenol, Advil (Treatment) finally this morning, yesterday was tiny, tiny bit better, this morning its little bit better but I am still little real nauseous and I feel like I mean like acid coming up constantly making me more nauseous and almost like unable to eat. Ever since Saturday all I will have been doing is three bites of chicken soup three times a day. What in the world is going on with this vaccine that it would cause those severe symptoms and my chest is still tight I still feel low congestion having hard time taking a deep breath in Mar2021&#34;. The outcome of the event &#34;my symptoms were so severe I felt like I was going to die I mean literally die&#34; was recovered on unspecified date. The outcome of the event unable to eat was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.  Information on lot/ batch number has been requested.

                                                I was 2 weeks post prolapse surgery and healing quite well.  I thought that would be enough time to wait to heal and get my vaccine.  I got the vaccine in the afternoon and that night at about 10 pm I started bleeding profusely with blood clots coming out of my vagina.  Before this I had no bleeding post surgery or any complications.  This lasted all night.  I went to the surgeon next day and the bleeding and blood clots had stopped.  2 days later it started again all night long.  I refrained, stupidly, to not go to ER because of the virus.  It stopped next day and then 2 days later I woke up in blood and clots and it would not stop.  I had to go to the ER my surgeon said to stop it.  He added more stitches to my previous surgery.

But when she took the 2nd shot, it&#39;s been bothering her through the weekend. Her left side weakness worsened. She described the feeling like the stroke. Her doctor said when she gets sick, it could mimic her stroke symptoms. She added it is worse in the morning when she tries to get up. The patient added that her leg is affected, and feels like a stroke in her leg on Mar2021. She had no treatment for her experience and doesn&#39;t know if there is a treatment for what she is experiencing. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After receiving my second dose I was fine with a little pain at the injection site on 4/8 and 4/9. On Saturday, 4/10 I woke up feeling dizzy and my blood pressure was around 180/85. As the day progressed the dizziness turned to double vision and my blood pressure was 212/102. At about 3:30 PM I contacted my cardiologist who advised I go to the ER. Tests were run and they found that I had a Dorsal Pons stroke which caused the double vision due to lack of movement in my right eye.

                                                blood clot; Right leg swelled and achy; Right leg swelled and achy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7534),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 67years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Beta thalassemias. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient stated she has never had a problem with vaccinations, and she gets the flu vaccine every year. The patient reported that after the first injection coincidentally she did develop a blood clot in her lower leg. She thinks that it was due to a plane ride, but she has never had a blood clot before the injection. She added that she had the first dose on 16Mar2021 and developed a clot in a week. She further clarified that she got her first injection on 16Mar2021 and realized when she went on a flight, which is not that far she developed that clot and was having problems shortly after flight home on 24Mar2021 where her leg swelled up and she is on blood thinners since she went to the emergency room. She added that she developed the clot sometime between that flight and 02Apr2021. She had a doppler study on an unspecified date and it showed a blood clot.  She stated that the outcome was she does not have the blood clot (as reported) but she will be on blood thinners and she needs to follow up on her scan to see if the clot issue is resolved but she will not have a doppler scan for another month or two and the blood thinner she is taking is Xarelto. She also stated that her right leg swelled up and it felt like a log. She reported it felt achy and swollen quite a bit from knee down and her leg was achy. It started between 24Mar2021 and by time she went to the emergency room she was not getting better. She had her symptoms for a week and toward the end of the week she thought she had a blood clot since it was not getting better it just got worse. She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better. The outcome of events was recovering. (As reported &#34;outcome is unknown but pretty sure it has improved because of the blood thinners&#34;./She stated she does not think it has resolved because it takes time for clots to resolve./She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better.)  The reporter stated for the seriousness criteria for event blood clot: she believes as a nurse that any blood clot is extremely dangerous, and she was not hospitalized but obviously a blood clot is serious, and she could have ended up with pulmonary embolism. The seriousness for events right leg swelled and achy was reported as medically disabling.  Causality assessment: Patient stated for the blood clot she has doubts if it was related to the vaccine but is it something that should be known about; for the leg swelling and achy she has doubts but it could have been the plane ride.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the reported events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is unlikely related to the suspected drug. The plane ride may provide an explanation for the events.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                Shortly after the second vaccination I started developing frequent occular migraines. I had them occasionally before, but they became very frequent. I also had very bad pain in my wrists, which is one of my indications of inflammation. I had none of the regular advertse symptoms, like chills, fever, etc, so didn&#39;t associate with the vaccine. Less than one month after the second shot I experienced intense occular migraine (no pain), dizziness and nausea. Went to ER the next morning, and I had had a stroke. The neurologist says can&#39;t tell if due to migraine, but there is a rare type of stroke caused by occulat migraine.

                                                On Thursday, 3/18, I woke up at 3:30 am extremely dizzy with everything moving around me.  Sitting up was better but upon laying down, the extreme dizziness returned.  I was still dizzy when I finally fell back asleep.  In the morning, I nearly passed out &amp; was in a cold sweat when I got up.  Gatorade helped. My PCP&#39;s office said it was probably a vaccine reaction.  I continued to feel rather light headed &amp; neck pressure &amp; by Tuesday, 3/23, I had a lot of body aches, diarrhea, I was definitely light headed &amp; felt like I could pass out.  Over the next days, my blood pressure was very unstable.  This random blood pressure issue continued  &amp; then the Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC&#39;s) began to increase in spite of the Metropolol.  They became very frequent causing light headedness &amp; neck pressure.  On 4/12, I went to the ER because my blood pressure was 185/50, heart rate 92.  Every 3rd beat was a PVC.  The cardiologist changed me to Verapamil 120 mg/day.  My condition deteriorated especially in the 3 days prior to the ablation.  I was short of breath with weak extremities.  The ablation was done on 5/25 &amp; the Cardiologist said I was having PVC&#39;s every 2 seconds.  I am currently recovering from the procedure.  Prior to the 2nd vaccine shot, my PVC&#39;s were well controlled by Metropolol to 18% from the 21% in February 2019 prior to taking Metropolol.  My blood pressure was consistently normal as well.

She was seen in the ED on 6/1 for fever and generalized weakness. She was worked up in the emergency department with unremarkable CBC, CMP, noninfectious UA, and negative blood cultures. Chest x-ray with improving right-sided pneumonia. Possible early left-sided pneumonia. She was tested for covid 19 which was positive. Patient started on Levaquin and discharged home. She was seen in Heme/Onc clinic where she felt fatigued and continued to have occasional fevers. She called our office on 6/4 complaining of worsening condition, poor oral intake (reportedly no oral intake since Monday), and intractable nausea. Decision made to admit the patient for observation overnight. The patients lab work showed improvement of her infection from last time. Her CXR was clear compared to last time. The patient did have some nausea but was able to tolerate PO intake. Given this the patient was educated on Covid 19 and discharged home with a follow up with PCP within 7 days.

This 67-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in deltoid right (arm right; deltoid right; she thinks) on 31Mar2021 15:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as 2nd dose, single at the age of 67-year-old for covid-19 immunisation. The patient historical vaccine includes received first dose of bnt162b2, via unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021, 3:15 in the afternoon, in left arm, deltoid with Lot: EN6199 at the age of 67-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Ongoing concomitant medications included citalopram; famotidine; ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION), all taking probably 4 or 5 years. She took allergy medicine this time of year but was not on that during this time. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history relevant to events. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient experienced mini stroke: facial droop, slurred speech, glossy eyes and a little out of it on 09May2021 23:45. Patient states she is calling regarding the Pfizer Covid vaccine. Five weeks after the second vaccine, she had a mini stroke. She has no high risk factors. She is being tested currently for Atrial Fib and has a monitor. She had all of the testing done at the hospital. Had an MRI, CT scan on the carotids, and echocar-diogram and lab work. She had a little bit high LDL and that was the only thing that was abnormal, so they put her on baby aspirin and a statin drug. This happened when she was out of town. When she got back into town, her primary care physician said to report the mini stroke to Pfizer. There had been no reported side effects of clotting or whatever, with Pfizer. Before that, she had no high blood pressure, she doesn&#39;t smoke, and does not have diabetes. So, he said to report it. Called 911 and the ambulance came. They checked her blood pressure and blood sugar and they were pretty good. They advised her to go to the ER. Her son and husband drove her to the ER. She was in PRIVACY and went to PRIVACY hospital. They admitted her to the ER and gave her aspirin. She does not recall if it was one or two. She should have had 2 but does not recall. They observed her there. All of the symptoms resolved within 3 minutes. She had facial droop, slurred speech and glossy eyes. Her husband said she seemed a little out of it. They admitted her to the observation unit and they ran all the testing. Was there 13 hours. She was just in observation and was not admitted to the hospital. They needed her to follow up in a week with her physician. Has heard of other people having mini strokes but she is no expert. Just thought it would be nice if down the road, if there were any association, it would be published anytime that it did occur. No additional information provided regarding this statement regarding other people having mini strokes. Min stroke required a visit to emergency room and physician office. Relevant Tests: CT of carotids, MRI, echocardiogram, lab work, were all normal but little high HDL. They also did a separate CT of the carotids. They were going to do an ultrasound but did the CT of the Carotids. Event mini stroke: facial droop, slurred speech, glossy eyes and a little out of it seriousness reported as medically significant. Treatment for event mini stroke: facial droop, slurred speech, glossy eyes and a little out of it: nothing else at the time except the aspirin. They discharged her and told her she need-ed to take baby aspirin every day and atorvastatin, generic Lipitor, 40mg every day. Has been taking ever since. The outcome of event mini stroke: facial droop, slurred speech, glossy eyes and a little out of it was recovered on 09May2021.The outcome of other event was unknown. Causality reported as unknown. She would say that it is questionable. Is it a possibility? Yes but does not know.

Right now they are like 30,000.; Suspect ITP; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 68-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 administered in Arm Left on 26Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9267) at age of 67-year-old as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Time the Vaccination Was Given Between 1100 and 1300. Vaccination Facility Type was Mass vaccination drive thru site. Medical history included she had a low platelet count before the vaccine, Seasonal allergies, Sinus headaches, diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity. She doesn&#39;t remember what vaccines caused her to have a sore arm, maybe tetanus, but she doesn&#39;t remember. Her maternal grandmother had leukemia which is one of the possible causes. She never had anybody else in her family with ITP or anything like that. Concomitant medications included paracetamol (TYLENOL), ibuprofen, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN), all taken for headache.  She had both doses of the Pfizer covid 19 vaccine. The patient had her first dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine (lot: EL9269) on 05Feb2021 in her right arm and her second dose in her left arm on 26Feb2021. One of the reasons she got them in 2 different arms was because she heard she might be less likely to have arm pain. She doesn&#39;t remember what vaccines caused her to have a sore arm, maybe tetanus, but she doesn&#39;t remember. It has been years since she had another vaccine. She had enough that she actually wrote in her journal on 28Feb2021 that she was getting unusual black and blue marks all over and they were bigger than usual. It is possible it was immediately as soon as she had the second dose. She wrote on 28Feb2021, but she knows that is not the first day she noticed it. It is getting better. she still gets new ones that seem random. She has 2 marks right now on her trunk. She has one on her stomach and one on her side. She is still getting them but not as frequent or as bad. Some she knew where they were from, and others she had no recollection of hitting herself. She went to the doctor and had a regular physical and bloodwork done, and she is in the process of being diagnosed. They suspect ITP (Immune Thrombocytopenia  Purpura). The AE require a visit to Physician Office. She gets seasonal allergies, and from time to time she gets sinus headaches. She thinks she might have had some headaches at that time. She assumed they were sinus headaches because it felt like they were. During the day she took 1 Excedrin and 1 Extra Strength Tylenol for the headaches. At night she sometimes took 2 Tylenol and sometimes Ibuprofen. She does remember having some headaches. Her headaches come and go. She had them she is thinking in February or March. She still has headaches. It is normal for her year round. She had quite a few more for a while, but now it is more normal like once a week. She takes the Excedrin, Extra Strength Tylenol, and Ibuprofen as needed. She tends to go with Excedrin and Tylenol for headaches during the day if she can. At night she tends to go with Tylenol unless she took it too close to bedtime to be able to take it at night. The Tylenol is 500mg. The Excedrin is a mixture of 250mg Acetaminophen, 250mg Aspirin, and 65mg caffeine. When she took the Ibuprofen she usually took 600mg. She did have bloodwork done. Her platelets are supposed to be 150,000 to 180,000, and hers are normally 120,000. Right now they are like 30,000. They said if she notices anything weird to go to the ER. She has had several platelet tests done. The first was on 04May2021, and her platelets were 30,000. The second was on 11May2021, and her platelets were 30,000. She had it done again on 17May2021, and her platelets were 25,000. Last week she had a bone marrow scan, and she will need a bone marrow biopsy. She did have a bone marrow biopsy done at a surgery center, but no treatment. It was to rule out other possible causes. The outcome of sinus headaches was recovering, of other events was unknown.

A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Additionally, the patient reported that she had a severe allergic reaction this past Saturday to the Covid Vaccine, stated the nurse sent her back to the pharmacist who told her she was having an allergic reaction to the vaccine. The patient reported having a hot face and neck was flushed, after the vaccine, she stated she had tingling in her tongue, lips, and face. And she stated her throat felt tight also, her lips were puffy, and a lot of heat of neck and face, thought she was starting to shake. The patient reported the pharmacist gave EpiPen in thigh and 20 mg tablet of Benadryl and called 911, and took her to the local hospital. Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets.

She has two Epi Pens from the drug store that was prescribed but she was afraid to use it, and she thought to see what happens if she uses the Benadryl. She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store.

She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot. The anaphylactic reaction required emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was in observation in ER. On 08Mar2021, the patient recovered from blood in stool, rectal bleeding, and burning and itching with bleeding. The patient had not yet recovered from severe allergic reaction, hot face and neck was flushed, tingling in tongue, lips, face; lips were puffy, and rash.

A 68-year-old female contactable consumer reporting for herself received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6200, expiry date Jun2021) on 16Feb2021 at 14:45, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine for age and several comorbidities. No other vaccines were administered within 4 weeks. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed 25 years ago, ongoing hypothyroidism diagnosed 25 years ago, liver resection in 2007 for a benign tumor (she had not been sick and it was found accidentally), liver bile duct stopped up from 2017 and ongoing (due to scar tissue from the liver resection surgery; she had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct), chronic Crohn&#39;s disease, ongoing thyroid disorder. The patient previously received flu vaccines on unspecified dates for immunization experiencing unspecified side effects some years ago, but this past year she didn&#39;t have a reaction. The patient previously received pneumonia shots on unspecified dates since few years. Family history included gallbladder problems in her sisters and mother. Concomitant medications included oral amlodipine (manufacturer: Lupin, expiry date: 23Feb2022) from an unspecified date (a few years ago) and ongoing, 5 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral telmisartan (MICARDIS; manufacturer: Alembic, expiry date: 02Mar2022) from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 80 mg at night, for blood pressure, oral metoprolol (manufacturer: Mylan, expiry date: 09Feb2022), from an unspecified date (few years ago) and ongoing, 25 mg twice daily, morning and night, for blood pressure, oral levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date (20 years ago or more), 75 ug daily in morning, with water, hour before any eating or other medications, for thyroid disorder. The patient experienced sepsis on 25Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 03Mar2021, gallbladder attack on 24Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, passed out from the gallbladder attack on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, got dizzy on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, weakness from being hospitalized on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, she was trying to gain her strength from being sick on an unspecified date in 2021 with outcome of unknown, her head hurt from the fall on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. The patient was hospitalized for sepsis due to a gallbladder attack from 25Feb2021 to 03Mar2021. The events gallbladder attack and sepsis required also an ER visit. They did not require a physician office visit. Additional clinical course of the events included the following details. Gallbladder attack turned into infection/sepsis quickly. She previously had an emergency stent placed in her bile duct and now there was a stone in the bile duct and she was unsure if it was related; they will either remove her gallbladder or place a permanent stent. They removed stones and &#34;goop&#34; and placed a stent. Her gallbladder still needed to be operated on, but she was not sick with sepsis anymore. Regarding gallbladder attack the patient reported that it was controlled until further tests and surgery were performed. They couldn&#39;t do the surgery due to the infection which had cleared up but she did not want the surgery right now. A stent was placed in the duct until something was done and the stone will be crushed eventually. The patient passed out from the gallbladder attack. She never passed out, she had only ever passed out one other time in her 20&#39;s where she stood up too fast. The patient reported that she had to walk slower because she got dizzy and she was trying to adjust to getting home. She walked to the bathroom, used it, and her husband heard a thump while he was using the other bathroom. She was looking at the thermostat and fell in the den and she was surprised she didn&#39;t hit anything. Her head hurt from the fall. Sepsis: caller reported that as soon as she went to the ER, she was diagnosed with sepsis. Sepsis resolved the day she was discharged from hospital and when she was dismissed all tests were negative for sepsis. She went home on antibiotics for security for another week after discharge from hospital. Dizzy: it was just trying to get her strength up. She&#39;ll just be doing nothing and getting up too fast, it happened to any old person with blood pressure medicines. Dizziness began before she went into the hospital. She was experiencing weakness from being hospitalized and she was trying to gain her strength from being sick. Weakness began during her hospital admission and it was ongoing. On 03Mar2021 the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included haematocrit: 30.4 %, haemoglobin: 10.4 g/dl (not in normal range yet), CMP: within normal limits (all results were within normal limits, including sodium and potassium), platelet count: 159, RBC count: 3.33 (supposed to be 3.9 or more but could have gotten better by now), WBC: 6.1 x10?/L, blood cultures: the results were not yet listed but sepsis was gone according to discharge blood work. She went to the doctor regularly. Her doctor knew how sensitive that was with her, but that her side effects were probably no more than anyone that experienced that. In some years she did not experience adverse events, specifically she did not with her flu vaccine in 2020. She has had side effects that had made her feel ill for 2-3 days and her niece was a nurse and thought she was making it up. The patient was advised to wait for the 2nd dose, she was unable to get it as scheduled on 08Mar2021. In meantime between receiving her first dose and her appointment for her second dose on 08Mar2021, she was hospitalized. The patient was just coming out of the hospital before 08Mar2021 and she still did not feel well so she cancelled the appointment. The hospital doctors, as well as the doctors approaching more tests with her gallbladder, recommended to not get the second dose as scheduled on 08Mar2021, but they could not recommend how or when to get it.

I was in Urgent Care, 2 ER&#39;s and hospitalized from March 14-24, 2021.  I was given 84 bottles of immunoglobulin intravenously and high potency steroids (90 mg., 80 mg.). This did not bring my platelets up so our daughter contacted the wife of the physician who passed from this after his vaccine who in turn gave our daughter the name of another physician who had seen and treated this after the Covid vaccine. He,together with my physicians, came up with an aggressive treatment plan for me. I was given one Vincristine treatment and injections of Nplates to jumpstart my body. This had never before been seen where I was located, as the Covid vaccine is so new. I was a perfectly healthy woman who only took vitamins and had not even had a cold all winter.  Everything else was ruled out.

                                                Received 2nd COVID vaccine on 4/19/21.  Apparently hadn&#39;t been feeling well since.  Presented to the ED on 4/21/21 with hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia and a GCS of 3.   Does have a history of ESRD on HD, but no missed dialysis sessions. Found to have a potassium of 8.7.  There was concern for pulmonary embolism but was not hemodynamically stable enough to undergo imaging.   Went into PEA arrest x 3 in the ED and ultimately died.  Of note, patient did have a recent ankle fracture recently and apparently has been non-ambulatory for at least the past few days.

                                                Patient found deceased at home 19 days after first dose of Pfizer vaccine. No reported side effects after vaccine. Patient did not have regular medical care. Autopsy performed due to lack of medical history and recent vaccination. Autopsy revealed marked pre-existing cardiac disease (hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease), which is the determined cause of death. Autopsy also revealed marked thyroid gland enlargement with Hashimoto thyroiditis diagnosed on histologic exam. It is unknown if this is pre-existing, as patient did not seek medical care and did not complain of symptomatology.

She has never experienced pain like this before. The R leg is also swollen from the calf down. She reports that sometimes the leg looks purple-ish and she endorses some tingling in the foot. Over the past couple weeks, she has also noted new dyspnea when walking. She denies fevers, chills, chest pain, palpitations, or cough. Of note, the patient had COVID-19 in November and since then has had some upper back pain which she currently has but it feels the same as usually does for her

                                                stroke; R sided weakness; expressive aphagia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A non-pregnant 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 05Feb2021 (at age of 68 years old, no pregnant, Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 1 diabetes, hypertension (HTN). The patient not had COVID prior vaccination also not had COVID tested post vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included insulin, lisinopril and Multi vitamin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Jan2021 at 03:00 P.M. (at age of 68 years old, Batch/Lot number unknown) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient received 2nd Covid shot on 05Feb2021. Had a stroke on 14Feb2021 at 08:00 AM with R sided weakness and expressive aphagia. Stroke noted on MRI in L hemisphere, speech area. The patient had no idea if this was related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine. AE resulted in: Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization (1 day), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatment received for events included observation, Lovenox. The outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Stroke, Weakness left or right side, and Expressive aphasia cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

Significant bladder pain, bleeding, incl clots  two days after second shot.  Resolved with cranberry pills after a few days. Thought maybe was due to eating jalapena peppers in my chicken nachoes. Both weekends. Then heard that women are reporting bizarre bleeding after vaccination so re evaluated and considered the bleeding could have been an adverse reaction to vaccine and decided to report my experience.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6206) via an unspecified route of administration on 16Apr2021 at 10:00 (&#34;around 10:00 or so&#34;; at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (the patient was &#34;fearful of the new variants and wanted to be extra protected against those variants.&#34;) Medical history included COVID in Dec2020 and uses oxygen (normally used oxygen, but not all the time), from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Medical history was also reported as none. Relevant family history related to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant medications (other products) were reported as none. The patient did not receive prior vaccinations, within 4 weeks prior, or on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient previously received iodine contrast dye on an unspecified date for an unspecified indication and experienced anaphylactic shock. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration on (at the age of 68-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced did not feel well, felt achy and nauseated (captured in AER: 2021495492). On 27Apr2021 the patient experienced had a blood clot in her lungs and she had tripped and fallen and on unspecified dates the patient experienced had headaches and felt nauseated. The course of events was reported as follows: &#34;After the second dose of the vaccine the patient felt fine, she felt pretty much okay. She attributed that to her having had COVID back in Dec2020 based on her biological knowledge. She ran this idea past a pharmacist that said that generally people might take the first dose of the COVID vaccine and be fine and then be worse on the second dose. But since she had COVID in Dec2020 her second dose of the COVID vaccine was the problem like how people&#39;s antibodies were already built up and had that reaction so that is why she was fine. She was walking out of the hospital on 27Apr2021, there were people that had crossed in front of them very quickly and her foot had hit the foot of a lady that was pushing a gurney. The patient tripped and fell down and she was taken to the emergency room. In the emergency room, a doctor did some tests and shockingly the doctor said that the patient had a blood clot in her lungs. A physician&#39;s assistant told the patient that she needed to have a computerized tomography (CT) scan done. The patient needed to go home to take care of responsibilities there, so she walked out of the hospital. She did not know if she had a blood clot in her lungs or not. Her doctor said that the blood clot in her lungs was based off of two blood values. One was the d-dimer that had a reference value of &lt; 500 and her level was 1,079 and the other blood work was troponin-I but it looked like it should be in the normal range because her level was less than 0.03 and the reference range was 0-0.04, so she would think that she would fall into the normal range. The d-dimer one was kind of scary. She had other tests done. They did a regular complete blood count (CBC) on her, another kind of test and another set of blood values but from looking at the results she was only a little low on a couple of things. They did not do the test with the contrast, but they did take an x-ray of her lung. The technician had found out that she had not had a Computed axial tomography (CAT) scan in a while, since she apparently needed them periodically, and she felt uneasy because that technician was urging her to get a CAT scan. The patient she did not know if these results were relevant or from the COVID vaccine. She did not understand this but when she was looking at the lab notice there was a note that the patient should be monitored for B Type Natriuretic Peptide (b/np) levels. It had the reference range on that one but when she read it, it looked like hers lied within the normal range. After the second dose she just had a headache but did not feel sick, but a week later they were telling her that she had a possible blood clot in her lungs. The patient was concerned at this point because she had no reason as to why she would have a possible blood clot. When she gets exhausted her oxygen drops and sometimes it will without her being exhausted. She was scared to go back to that one hospital. She was thinking about going to another hospital that was 60 miles away. If they would need to keep her overnight, she would need to make arrangements for her animals. She has had headaches, but they may be due to stress. She did not feel sick, other than she had been nauseated. The patient stated that she was not saying that what was reported on report 1 of 2 was due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why would they say that she had a blood clot too.&#34; The clinical outcomes of the events had a blood clot in her lungs, she had tripped and fallen, had headaches, and felt nauseated were all unknown.

I waited a few days and it happened again. I contacted my physician and they gave my a monitor to wear, they diagnosed it as atrial fibrillation.  The doctor wanted to monitor it long term.   I currently have a loop recorder in which  they download the data everyday.  I have not have any atrial fibrillation since there.  I did not have any shortness of breath or I did not faint.  They are going to repeat my EKG in a few months to make sure it doesn&#39;t show anything else.

A 68-years-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6206), via an intramuscular route on 08Mar2021 (at the age of 68-years) as 1st dose, single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included a list of allergies to various medications. She has a anaphylactic type reactions with contrast, iodine, and opiates, cardiac disorder, bladder infection, immune system problem, carcinoid tumour, severe pneumonia after being in contact with people from South America on Dec2019, experienced 104°F fever, vomit and GI tract infections, it was resolved after sleeping for 3 days and drinking liquids and irritable bowel, tubular adenoma. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took oral steroids, oral yeast infection medication, and tetracycline cause blisters all over to form. On unspecified date, the patient experienced diarrhoea, fatigue, chest pain, and pain in between ribs, Approximately 5 or 6 hours after vaccination she experienced pain in her stomach and ribs, this continued for up to 36 hours after vaccination, then, she experienced intermittent episodes of diarrhoea. Had also felt very tired, she did not wanted to went outside. Patient took BENADRYL for these symptoms. It was reported that patient had cardiac problems (did not mention the exact condition), after receiving the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 vaccine she felt pain in her shoulders, thought she was about to had a heart attacked. Due to her heart condition, many medications caused arrhythmias, she was unable to took muscle relaxers, pain medicines, or FLEXERIL. The patient had a history of immune problems (again, did not clarify what conditions), experiences frequent infections and had to used (unidentified) antibiotics, some antibiotics caused GI discomfort and infections. She was thinking that by the time the vaccine dna mixes with her dna. Asks for a resource where she could look up information. After having antibiotic-related as she ate yoghurt and ate a special diet of probiotics. She had a carcinoid tumour that doctors could&#39;ve found. Patient wants to knew that she was having issues with her stomach and wants to knew how long would this went on. Got the shot on the 8th and it was been 3 weeks. Wants to knew if she could&#39;ve took buttermilk since it puts the good bacteria backed into the stomach. Patient stated that irritable bowel that did not went away and researched this to helped herself and found foods to heal. She had a carcinoid tumour that they can&#39;t got to because she can&#39;t took contrast. They gave me contrast at 40 years old and it blew me up liked a blowfish. Patient started doing these shakes and about 6 weeks later, her diarrhoea quits but still had diarrhoea off and on. She bad reactions to antibiotics all the time since it gives me diarrhoea. The stomach ache went away but the diarrhoea continued. She had the diarrhoea almost every day since the shot, except 2 or 3 days. Back in Dec2019, they thought she had COVID since she had a large amount of antibodies so may not needed the second shot (as reported). She had bad diarrhoea after her first COVID vaccine for 10 days. After her second vaccine, it went away. She thought the second shot balanced it out. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Mid day on April 2, I suddenly developed vaginal bleeding then within 8 hours bleeding stopped. In the meantime, that afternoon I went to see Dr.  and I was still bleeding when I went there. He did a biopsy and scheduled me to get a Vaginal ultrasound the next week. He also gave me some hormonal pills but my bleeding had stopped. For the next 25 days, I had no spotting, no bleeding or anything at all. At around noon time, on April 26, I began bleeding again but this time it wasn&#39;t bright red but it was a light brown color. By that afternoon, it had stopped. In the next 5 days, I had similar episodes but it got very light until it faded. Later on May 17, I had a very light yellowish brown discharge. Since then, this has been it.

                                                I had mild covid in October, 2020 so when I got the Pfizer first MRNA vaccine in March, 2021, I felt ill and went to sleep. Then for weeks I had bowel inflammation (pellet poop) and on 4-20-2021 I went to the hospital with left heart pain, left shoulder pain, very fatigued, and difficulty breathing. This got worse over time and I ran a low grade fever, and doctors told me to take Tylenol. I flew on 5-17-2021 and on 5-21-2021, I was admitted to the hospital for 13 days, on oxygen, with pericarditis and pneumonia. Left lung had 600 mL fluid. No infection was found and final diagnosis was Post Pfizer covid 19 vaccine inflammatory syndrome with pericarditis. My miracle drug was anakinra injections which stopped my inflammatory response. I hope this helps others as I almost died. Dr made the diagnosis and I have all reports. My WBC (16.3) and CRP (298) rose until anakinra injections.

This 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number  ELU266), via an unspecified route of administration at single dose in left arm on 20Feb2021 12:45 for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included allergies to medications penicillins, ceclor, statins, environmental; diabetes; hypertension; asthma; gastrooesophageal reflux disease. The vaccine was administered at Health Clinic. Concomitant medications included rabeprazole, clonazepam, montelukast, venlafaxine hydrochloride. On 22Feb2021, the patient experienced immune thrombocytopenia purpuria, bleeding of gums, nose, skin pricks, platelet count of 1000. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included steroids, IVGM, platelets, PRBC, iron, antibiotics. The outcome of the events was recovering. The patient was hospitalized and condition was life threatening. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included platelet count: 1000 on 22Feb2021, SARS-CoV-2 test: negative on 07Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of the vaccine BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be excluded based on plausible temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 69-year-old female patient (patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN3248, Expiry date: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Feb2021, 15:30 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation (age at vaccination was 69 years). Medical history included blood pressure and thyroid. Concomitant medication patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included levothyroxine, valsartan, furosemide, acetaminophen. No other vaccine was received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 16Feb2021, 3 hours after the patient received the vaccination at 18:30 the patient&#39;s left leg from the knee down started to swell, got really hard and became very painful. She could hardly walk and afterwards the pain was so intense that she went to the doctor. Doctor took X-rays of her left leg on 16Feb2021, then he diagnosed her with blood clots. He gave the patient 2 heparin shots and immediately sent her to the hospital for a deep vein ultrasound on 16Feb2021. The results showed blood clot in the leg. The patient was prescribed medication and sent home. Her leg continued to be rock hard and painful. On 02Mar2021, the patient was sent for a blood panel work up. There was no improvement. On 08Mar2021, the doctor sent her for a lung CT scan. On the same evening, the patient was called to the doctor&#39;s office and was sent to ER immediately as the results showed blood clot in the lung. The patient&#39;s dose of Eliquis was doubled. This has now been going for 5 weeks, the patient had not been without pain during this time. Her left leg hardness had gone down a little but was still twice the size of her right leg, knee was huge. The swelling never goes down, not even at night. No covid prior vaccination and no covid tested post vaccination was reported. This case was reported as serious. The outcome of all the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient reports symptoms of right hand numbness and weakness and slurred speech.  These occurred around 7:30 pm but it is unclear exactly what day they happened as one physician noted the day of the vaccine and another noted 2 days after the vaccine.  The slurred speech resolved in 5 minutes but the hand continued to have some numbness and tingling.  Patient was referred to the neurologist who diagnosed a TIA and ordered further workup.  Patient was found to have calcified plaques in the left proximal internal carotid artery with severe stenosis.  She was referred to vascular surgery for an endarterectomy.  During the process of clearing her for surgery she was seen by a cardiologist who requested that this event be reported to VAERS.

                                                Patient is a 69-year-old woman with newly diagnosed pericarditis in March 2021, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hypothyroidism, who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with progressively worsening chest pain, dyspnea, and fatigue. Patient was in her usual state of health until 3/1/2021, when she developed sudden-onset pain &#34;across the entire chest&#34;.  She shares that her symptoms &#34;came out of the blue&#34;, as &#34;suddenly one day, everything just hurt&#34;.  She saw her primary care physician, who initially felt her symptoms were due to acid reflux.  As such, the patient started &#34;eating antacids and omeprazole like candy&#34;.  However, her chest pain persisted, prompting her to follow up with her primary care physician on 3/16/2021.  At that time, ECG reportedly showed normal sinus rhythm and no acute changes.  CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast showed abnormal enhancement and thickening of the pericardium with trace pericardial fluid, consistent with pericarditis.  The patient was therefore started on colchicine and an ibuprofen taper.   On 4/5/2021, Patient sent a myVM portal message to her primary care physician and cardiologist, expressing her belief that her chest pain has remained unchanged over the past month.  She continues to experience a constant burning sensation throughout her chest, aggravated by deep inspiration and alleviated by lying flat on her back.  She shares that walking up the stairs at home leaves her &#34;breathless&#34;.  Associated symptoms include subjective fevers, chills, and night sweats.  Given these symptoms, Patient underwent a chest x-ray, which showed findings consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion.  Patient was then advised to present to the ED for further workup as an inpatient.   At time of hospital admission, patient endorses persistent chest pain during inspiration.  Prior to 3/1/2021, she has never experienced these symptoms and reports no history of pericarditis.  The most strenuous physical activity she has undertaken in the last month include working in the garden and caring light boxes down the stairs.  She is most concerned about the fluid around her heart.  Patient reports no nausea, vomiting, palpitations, constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain.  Of note, the patient developed pericarditis 10 days after her second COVID-19 vaccine.  Hospital Course        # Sub-acute pericarditis with enlarging pericardial effusion Pericarditis initially diagnosed in March 2021, thought to be potentially from her COVID-19 vaccine given time course as no other clear etiology apparent.  Pt was hemodynamically stable with an elevated jugular venous pressure at time of admission, with CXR consistent with an enlarging pericardial effusion. Echo 04/05 with small circumferential pericardial effusion but no tamponade physiology.  Cardiac MRI on 4/7 with enlargement of moderate-sized pericardial effusion but otherwise negative exam, with no evidence of myocarditis or infiltrative myocardial process. ANA screen negative, rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP not elevated Blood cultures x 2 with no growth - CRP continued to remain &gt; 160 with ibupofen and colchicine. Prednisone 20 mg PO daily was added on 4/7, with subsequent improvement in patient&#39;s symptoms.   - Discharged on regimen of prednisone 20 mg PO daily and colchicine 0.3 mg PO daily (reduced from 0.6 mg daily that she was taking prior to admission). She will also continue using ibuprofen 800 mg BID.  - Follow-up with Dr (cardiology) next week to follow-up on hospitalization and decide upon tapering plan for her medications

                                                Pulmonary embolism; tested positive for Covid/shortness of breath/severe cough/headache; tested positive for Covid/shortness of breath/severe cough/headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the first of two cases.   A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), the first dose administered in the right arm on 14Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) and the second dose administered in the left arm on 03Apr2021 at 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737), both intramuscular as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure both diagnosed 5 years ago, GERD and hypercholesteremia, all ongoing. The patient was a former smoker but has been smoke-free for 15 years. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for hypercholesterolaemia from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown) taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metformin (manufacturer unknown) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing.  The patient did not have any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that she and her daughter had their second dose of the vaccine on 03Apr2021. The patient tested positive for Covid. The patient developed shortness of breath on Sunday, 11Apr2021, and ended up with a pulmonary embolism. The patient doesn&#39;t know if she was possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine with thousands of other people. At the time of the report, the patient was mostly resolved and they are all home. She became short of breath, had severe cough and headache and she went to the ER and on the CAT scan they discovered she had a small pulmonary emboli. She was hospitalized from 11Apr2021-12Apr2021. The patient was given Eliquis and monoclonal antibodies as treatment for the events. The patient stated that she will be on Eliquis for the next month because of the pulmonary embolism. The patient did not need any additional therapies for COVID-19. The patient did not have any pre-existing diseases that worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The outcome of the event &#39;tested positive for Covid/shortness of breath/severe cough/headache&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the event pulmonary embolism was recovering. The relatedness of the suspect drug to the reactions  was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears reasonable that the suspect drug did not contribute to the development of the reported event pulmonary embolism, that most likely was related to the concurrent development of COVID-19. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 69-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular on Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included estradiol taken for menopausal symptoms, start and stop date were not reported; acetylsalicylic acid taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No other vaccines received withing 4 weeks. The patient developed B/L LE DVT 1 week s/p 2nd vaccine on 27Apr2021. Event resulted in physician&#39;s clinic visit and was given anticoagulation. Outcome of the events was recovering. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and had not been tested post-vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported DVT and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully  excluded. However, the age of the patient and use of estradiol may confound the reported drug event pair. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She couldn&#39;t talk; seemed completely out of it; swollen lymph nodes/enlarged lymph node in her right lung/swollen lymph nodes on her right breast; mass in her throat; panic attack; experiencing some difficulty breathing; anxiety; This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers (one is the patient&#39;s husband) received via medical information team and from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 69-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: EP7533, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 12:00 (at the age of 69-years-old) at 2nd dose, single in the right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s disease from an unspecified date (had it for years), basal cell cancer, and the patient&#39;s immune system was compromised. It was reported that the patient&#39;s father had lymphoma and passed away due to kidney cancer. The patient&#39;s mother died at the age of 97-years-old, and was healthy. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s thyroiditis. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: ER8727) received on 21Mar2021 15:00 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that the patient experienced swelling on left arm where the injection was and little bit of swelling in the lymph nodes in armpit. The patient&#39;s height was 163cm, and weight was 68.01kg; both on unspecified dates. He patient&#39;s husband reported that something was happening with his wife (patient), and he cannot find the patient&#39;s symptoms on the website. It was reported that the patient had the second shot of Pfizer vaccine 3 weeks ago, this past Sunday. The second shot was given in the patient&#39;s right arm, and the first shot was given in the left arm. Everything was normal for close to three weeks. Then on Sunday, on 24Apr2021, the patient lost her voice all of a sudden. She couldn&#39;t talk, seemed to be completely out of it, and the patient&#39;s husband thought that she was having a stroke. They went to the ER (emergency room). The doctor though that the problem was that the scented detergent the patient used for her mask. The doctor thought that it caused a severe case of laryngitis. The patient was sent home. The patient&#39;s voice was still weird last week. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right arm, and breast were swelling. On 2021, the patient experienced some difficulty breathing and anxiety. Two days ago, on 02May2021, the patient noticed that her right breast on the same side as the second shot was enlarged, heavy, and firm. The patient has no history of breast cancer. A couple of days prior (in 2021), the patient&#39;s arm was swollen. It was her whole arm. The patient was scheduled to see her dermatologist at 11:30 this morning since she was having a basal cell cancer removed from her face. The patient was all upset and hyper and was having trouble breathing a little bit. The patient&#39;s husband thought that it was stress. The patient was scheduled for surgery on her face on Wednesday this week and the patient had a panic attack on an unspecified date in 2021 so the patient was brought to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s husband stated that this was because the patient was scheduled for a surgery for basal cell cancer removal, and that the patient&#39;s breast being so large, the patient was worried. The patient had Hashimoto&#39;s disease for years, and her immune system was compromised. The extra swelling could be because her immune system was working overtime. The patient&#39;s voice was good for a while, but today, she was losing it again. The patient uses different laundry detergent now. The patient&#39;s husband stated that these never happened before, and that it could be coincidental. The patient had no reactions prior to the 3-week period after the shot. The patient was wheezing now, and the patient&#39;s husband may need to call an ambulance. The patient&#39;s husband further stated that he took the patient to the hospital (emergency room) this morning because the patient was wheezing and sounded horrible. The hospital record stated that the patient had an enlarged lymph node in her right lung and that her right breast was swollen and infected. The patient was currently in the emergency room and was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was going to have a biopsy today. After the patient&#39;s first dose, she had a little swelling on her left arm where the injection was and a little bit of swelling in the lymph nodes in her armpit. The patient&#39;s husband noticed that the patient&#39;s right arm where the second injection site was, not just the site but her whole right arm swelled, from shoulder to wrist. The patient&#39;s husband also noticed that the patient&#39;s right breast was huge. On 05May2021, the patient had MRI and CAT scans which showed &#34;extensive mediastinal mass effect continuous from right to left side with greatest dimension of 10cm. Mid left pillar idiopathy and subcarinal area neoplastic disease&#34;. She was having a biopsy done today at the hospital&#34;. The patient&#39;s lymph nodes were swollen in the area between her lungs. On 05May2021, the patient had her COVID test which showed negative result. It was then reported that the biopsy was going to be either Ebus (as reported), which is where a tube was put down the throat, and if that did not work, there would be a mediastinoscopy performed and after that, there is a possibility that CAT scan will be done. The patient&#39;s husband reported that on Apr2021, the patient&#39;s right breast was diagnosed with cellulitis so the patient received a couple of IV (intravenous antibiotics) for the breast and it slightly improved. The patient&#39;s cellulitis could lead to sepsis that&#39;s why she was treated with IV antibiotics. The patient&#39;s MRI on an unspecified date showed that the patient&#39;s breast was clear of any swollen lymph nodes and potential cancer. The patient was also given IV antibiotics for breast enlargement, breast swelling, and breast infection. On Apr2021, the patient experienced side effects mass in her throat, swollen lymph nodes on her right breast, and cellulitis. The patient will be undergoing a biopsy today, because they think that patient has lymphoma. It was reported that the patient received her vaccination at a huge vaccination setup at a local high school. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days (unspecified dates) due to the events breast enlargement, swelling arm, breast swelling, breast cellulitis, and breast infection. The patient&#39;s husband also stated that the patient was brought to the emergency room for because the right arm started swelling and that the right breast was huge, then was taken to the hospital room that night. No other vaccine received within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events  breast cellulitis, and loss of voice was recovering, for events swelling arm and panic attack was recovered on an unspecified date, and for other events was unknown.

In particular, she states her right arm, right face, and right torso was numb when she woke up on Saturday morning, May 29th.  She initially thought she just had some radicular symptoms going down her right arm as she has had before.  However, she does admit that the facial numbness did concern her.  She had a headache that morning, but no headache after that.  She states that some of the sensation has come back a little bit in the right arm and hand.  However, she still can not hold anything without up falling out of her hand because she can not feel it.  She denies any weakness in the right side of her body.  She denies any facial droop.  She does think her vision may have gotten a little bit worse, but this is difficult to tell because she does usually have poor vision.  Because of her symptoms in the office, I thought it was best that I admit her for observation in order to rule out acute stroke.

                                                On April 3rd I woke up with a fast heart beat. I have one of the meters that give oxygen and beats per minute and it was registering at 41 and then it wasn&#39;t registering at all. After an hour I was dizzy and light headed. I was wasn&#39;t feeling right. I went to ER and my heart was beating at 240 beats per minute. They give me diltiazem. They though it was Atrial fibrillation. At 9:15 my heart went into a normal rhythm. They put me on diltiazem and put me on Eliquis to prevent strokes until I could get to a doctor later on in the week. When I left the hospital it was at normal heart beats at 72 beats per minute. I went to Dr. on April 12th. He thought it was SVT or Atrial fibrillation for sure. He referred me to an electro physiologist. I went in for an ablations on May 4th. They suspected I had Atrial fibrillation and SVT before the vaccine.

                                                I had the PFIZER EW0167, at @1pm on 5/5/2021. Thé second dose was scheduled for 5/26/21; however, I canceled it because of what I went through. Three days after taking the vaccine, Saturday, May 8, 2021, I had four mini-strokes simultaneously. 911 was called and was taken to Hospital. On Friday, May 14, 2021, I had another stroke. After being discharged on Tuesday, May 18, 2021, I returned to the hospital on Wednesday, 28, 2021, with weakness and unable to stand or walk without two assists.  I was very happy it was not another stroke, but my potassium and magnesium were so depleted, that the doctors were trying to figure out what happened. I had three treatments of potassium, two orange drinks and one through intravenous, and four treatments of magnesium with two pills each time. I am afraid to take the second vaccine as I now had six strokes; also, the cardiologist have found that  my heart was spitting out lots of blood clots at an alarming rate, so they had to give me I.V Heparin, now I am on Eliquis. I am asking to look into this, as the vaccine is new. I was excited to get the vaccine, now I am honestly scared. Thank you,

                                                So I had the shot on March 28, 2021 and let&#39;s see if I can remember the date, I&#39;ll get my calendar which will help me a little bit, so it started the end of April 2021. I noticed a difference in my breathing, I had not been active and I just didn&#39;t feel very good. On the 28th of April I was feeling very weak, feeling like a wimp, I couldn&#39;t do anything without feeling very exhausted. Then on May 5 2021 I told my husband I just was not feeling right, I had to sit down just when getting dressed. I went to the bathroom and I felt like something was really wrong, I could not even walk around without feeling tired. On May 5 2021 I called my son who is an RN and he took my BP and heart rate, but my oxygen was 91 and then 87 again when he tested again. He said he felt I had a pulmonary embolism, they called my cardiologist. The DR told me to go to the hospital and they did an EKG and took me to an ER room to do a chest x-ray. They said there was something on my chest so they did bloodwork. He then said I had blood clots on both my lungs. Then later on that night they did ultrasounds of my legs. They found a deep vein thrombosis. They then broke the news that I was not going home, that they were going to admit me. I ended up in a monitored room for four days. They put me on oxygen and wires. 4,000 units of heparin drip w/ 2,0000 units per hour. They then switched me to Luvanox and Coumadin. They could not figure out why this happened to me. They found no infections, nothing cancerous or anything. They sent me home with blood thinners (coumadin) all the time. Then two weeks later I woke up in the middle of the night with a lot of pressure on my chest and I went to the ER again. I was never admitted, they just checked me. Then two weeks later again it happened and I went to on call, they took pictures of my heart and everything again and they could not find anything. They did a study of sleep on me and they found I have a sleep apnea problem. They are recently now working on my sleeping problem and I will be admitted and studied over night on the machines. In between all this I also went to my PCD and now that is to current, up to date is what has been happening recently.

                                                This is a solicited report based on the information received by Pfizer. A non-contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 69-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Injection), dose 1 via intramuscular in Feb2021 at age of 69-year-old single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; adalimumab (HUMIRA, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen), subcutaneously from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, at unspecified dose for moderate to severe adult Crohn&#39;s disease. The patient&#39;s medical history and patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a Covid-19 Vaccine Trial. In Feb2021, the patient experienced bleeding. The event was reported as non-serious.  The action taken in response to the event for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the event was resolved on 15Apr2021. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event of bleeding with Humira (Adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product bnt162b2 was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

The issue is that the tingling sensation I was experiencing was moving in my left leg, was painful but then it went away. I went to the emergency room 02-25-2021 that started with a blood clot and they placed me on Xarelto medication. My PCP encouraged me to go to the ER. they did an U/S of my left lower extremity which showed blood clot.  I am already on blood thinner medication and no one can explain  or give me an answer as to why I have a blood clot after my vaccine when i am on blood thinner medication.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

On 20Mar2021 18:00, the patient started to have heart palpitations and a rapid irregular pulse. Per pulse oximeter, heart rate was 133 beats/minute. In the emergency room an electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation. Cardiac, thyroid and all other labs were normal. Atrial fibrillation resolved in the emergency room without treatment. Discharged to home, appointment in clinic on 23Mar2021 with a cardiologist, who ordered Cartia XT (started 23Mar2021) and Eliquis (started 23Mar2021 after stress test). On 24Mar2021 a cardiac echo and a myocardial profusion imaging stress test were completed and results on both tests were reported as being normal. There was no past diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or of the above symptoms of heart palpitations and rapid irregular heartbeat. The symptoms have not been experienced since the initial episode on 20Mar2021. Plans are to remain on Cardia XT and Eliquis, and to be seen on 23Jun2021 in the cardiology clinic for an electrocardiogram and an appointment with the cardiologist. Therapeutic measures (Cartia XT 120mg per day, Eliquis 5mg two times a day) were taken as a result of the event. The patient not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On an unknown date in Mar2021 the event was recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                On the morning of Friday 4/16/21, patient came to vaccine clinic to let us know that his wife passed away the night of her second dose of her Pfizer covid vaccine. He states that she complained of arm pain at the injection site that evening (4/14/21) and went to bed around 9:30pm because the pain was excruciating. He said around 2:00am, she woke up stating she couldn&#39;t breathe. This has happened before, so she went and sat up in the living room which helped her last time. For whatever reason, she then went into her bedroom where he said she fell out. He noticed foam coming from her mouth and called 911. EMS was unable to revive her. She passed away at home.

I also tested positive on 12/16/2020. I started to have a lot of problems with my legs. I had a lot of pain in my right leg. I was also very short of breath. It was excruciating pain at the top of my right thigh. I have been a runner in the past so this in unusual for me. I have a blood clot that was found on a scan with contrast. I have seen an ENT, Neurologist, Cardiologist, Orthopedist and Hematologist. I am also a cancer survivor of Non-Hodgkin?s Lymphoma. I have been prescribed Eliquis and taking it for one week and the pain has improved.

Three weeks later I noticed it was not going away and seen my doctor and had a Covid test and got a negative but chest X-ray said I was diagnosed with acute pneumonia and I&#39;m on medication.

Treatment team Sepsis  Principal problem Discharge Summary    Inpatient Discharge Summary   BRIEF OVERVIEW Admitting Provider:  Discharge Provider:     Admission Date: 3/26/2021     Discharge Date: 4/5/2021   Discharge Diagnosis Severe sepsis COVID-19 pneumonia Acute hypoxic respiratory failure Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with RVR   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY   Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission patient is an 70 y.o. female with a past medical history of atrial fibrillation chronically anticoagulated with Xarelto, S/P ablation x3 at the Medical Center, and sinus bradycardia who presented to the ED for evaluation of general malaise, shortness of breath, loss of taste and smell, coughing, and shortness of breath and was found to have sepsis due to COVID-19 pneumonia in the ED.   Patient states that over the past week she has been extremely weak, with nausea, diarrhea, but denies vomiting. She also reports that her appetite has decreased and noted that the symptoms has worsened and as a result she presented to the ED for further evaluation.Patient denies abdominal pain, lightheadedness, or chest pain.   Upon further evaluation and tests in the ED, she was noted to have severe sepsis as indicated by vital signs and chest x-ray imaging indicating groundglass pneumonia typical of COVID-19 infection. She also had COVID-19 swab which returned  positive result. Additionally, patient was noted to be hypoxia with SPO2 of 88% requiring oxygen supplementation.    Hospital Course patient was admitted to a Hospital due to shortness of breath, with fatigue and weakness, and was found to have severe sepsis with endorgan damage of acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.  Imaging study showed no evidence of PE, but did show evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.   Pulmonary was consulted, she was started on remdesivir with Decadron.  She had an increase in oxygen requirement to the maximum of 10 L via specialty nasal cannula during the admission.  With the treatment of remdesivir and Decadron she had improvement in her hypoxia, and was ultimately weaned to room air by the time of discharge.   She underwent a desaturation study on the day of discharge and determined that she did not need any supplemental oxygen.  She completed her entire steroid and remdesivir course during the admission.  She had no evidence of superimposed bacterial pneumonia.   Her hospitalization was complicated by atrial fibrillation/flutter with RVR, that improved with metoprolol administration.  This was thought to be precipitated by her severe hypoxia with acute illness.  She was kept on metoprolol 25 mg twice daily on discharge, and will need to follow-up with her cardiologist at  Medical Center to determine if she can come off of this again.  She will continue to take her Xarelto as previously prescribed.   She was medically stable for discharge on 4/5 in stable condition, and will need to follow-up with PCP within 7 days, with cardiology within 2 weeks at the hospital, and pulmonary within 2 weeks as well.

                                                She keeps losing more and more weight; Petite mal seizures/frequency of seizures increased; Grand mal convulsion/ One clonic tonic or grand mal seizure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse (patient). A 70-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 administered in Arm Left on 19Feb2021 08:45 (Lot Number: EN6198) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included epilepsy (diagnosed since age 6), guillain-barre syndrome (she cannot get the flu vaccine anymore because of her history of with Guillain-Barre Syndrome), she had COVID-19 in AUG2020 and has been having increased seizures since then as well, Seizures. She was positive on her COVID test, she forgets what was that it said when it came back, it didn&#39;t say positive, it said something else, she went back and forth after that first COVID test. She says it said detected, it didn&#39;t say anything else. She says after that she came home and self quarantined for 14 days, then went back for piece of mind to get a negative test, but they said positive, so then she quarantined 21 days that time. She says she went back and they tested her with the gold test which takes longer to her understanding to study that, and that came back negative. She says after 21 days she built up enough antibodies for it to be negative. She clarifies that she had COVID and COVID testing done before getting the doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, before she got her her vaccinations. She had no other vaccinations on the dates she got her Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses or in the four weeks prior.  She uses Lysol wipes and Clorox to clean her house and her door knobs. She says she uses hand sanitizer and wears 1-2 masks. She says in 1990 she had an airborne virus that put her in intensive care for 21 days and she was paralyzed, so she is thankful to be alive, and that she is no longer paralyzed. She says this came along, and it brought back a lot of horrible memories. Caller says she had to live with something, and her mask, and a lot of handwashing. Call handler attempted to clarify this statement with the caller. Concomitant medications included clobazam (Manufacturer: Microlabs. NDC: 4271-315-01, EXP: 09Aug2021) 10mg tablets, two twice a day  taken for seizure; levetiracetam (LEVETIRACETAM 1A FARMA) 500mg, four tablets in the morning and four at night, taken for seizure.  The patient previously received first doe of bnt162b2 administered in Arm Left on 22Jan2021 08:45AM (Lot Number: EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation . The patient would like to know if the COVID-19 infection increases seizure activity. She has a history of epilepsy and has received both dose of her vaccine. She states that she petite mal seizures and has One clonic tonic or grand mal seizure on 2APR2021 at 12:35AM. She also reports that she keeps losing more and more weight and does not know why. She states that in JUL2020 she was 196 pounds and today she weighs 177 pounds. About frequency of seizures increased, the patient says that her seizures had been pretty well been controlled, for 6 months. She says that there were a couple times she had months seizure free, but now can&#39;t get through the day without multiple seizures. She says they are petit mal, but she is also having grand mal seizures. She clarifies that her seizures increased last July, after she got out of rehab, they got worse during the month of August. She confirms that she was diagnosed with COVID-19 in August 2020. She clarifies her seizures increased before she got the doses of the vaccine this year. She says she had convulsions on 2Apr2021, a grand mal seizure, at 12:35 in the morning. She was just wondering if there was any connection between COVID-19 and increased seizure activity. She says her neurologist and she are both hitting their heads on the floor and trying to think of what combination of meds could stop her seizures and convulsions to get her down to where she is not having multiple petit mal every day. She says she used to see her neurologist every 2-3 months, now she sees him every month. She says every 2-3 months he changes her medication. She says he has her on two drugs now, and he increased them both, they are hoping to get answers, if her seizures have not calmed down and gone away he is going to take her off Keppra. She is taking the Keppra generic, named Levetiracetam, she takes 500mg, four tablets in the morning and four at night. She says the other anti seizure medication is Clobazam, she takes two pills a day. She says each time he puts her on a different drug it is another chemical change to her body and another expense to be constantly changing drugs. She says her neurologist might change her medications again when she goes back May 20th for her follow up. She says there could be drug interactions and stuff that her neurologist might not be aware of, she is not having a fun time. She says her neurologist tried to put her on two different drugs to good take care of the problem, one was Keppra and her insurance denied that one so he said let&#39;s try this one and put it thru her insurance for authorization and it was accepted but they said they don&#39;t carry it and get her private pharmacist. The outcome of Petite mal seizures and Grand mal seizure was not recovered, of other event was unknown.

A 70-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE: Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 70-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 25Feb2021 12:27 PM as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included herpes in her eye, osteoporosis from 2002, Blood pressure high from 2010, High cholesterol from 2010. Concomitant medication included valacyclovir hydrochloride (VALACYCLOVIR HYDROCHLORIDE) 1000mg a day taken for herpes ophthalmic and GABAPENTIN for unspecified indication. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE: Solution for injection; Batch/Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 at 10:58 AM for covid-19 immunisation. The patient said that she got her first dose 04Feb2021 at 10:58AM and second dose 25Feb2021 at 12:27PM, and both were given in her left arm. She said that her adverse effect was a reaction that has been continuing after second shot, which they gave her second shot in the same arm where the first was higher up. The patient also reported that &#34;I am having a reaction to the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. It&#39;s been going on for several days now. I was fine after the first shot. I got the second shot in the same arm as the first. About 4 or 5 inches down from the injection site I have a rash, it&#39;s red, itchy...just yucky. How long will these symptoms would last. She says that the next day she experienced a fever of 100.3, unable to verify if caller meant 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit. She says she had significant soreness under near her armpit, fatigue, and an itchy rash that is still current since 27th. She says that the rash started to appear she was initially sore around site with redness, and it started getting big and itchy. She says that the rash has stayed about the same. Caller says they have not had any other recent vaccinations or started any new medications. She says she does take Valacyclovir that she gets from Express Scripts that has an RX number on the pharmacy bottle label. She said she stopped taking this medication after her rash developed. Caller said she takes this medication for herpes in her eye, she has taken 1000mg a day for years. Caller said she also takes Gabapentin, no further details provided about this medication. Caller says that they get T4 levels, they are high, the day before she got the first dose, on 03Feb her TSH level or T4 was 4.94, which is above high normal and has been stable since they started monitoring it from way back in 2013. Patient reported Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions (for example rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema) have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine during mass vaccination outside of clinical trials. Provide that everyone may react differently. Caller said she applied Hydrocortisone cream yesterday, and she would have thought that maybe she should have had the second shot in her other arm. She said she had no symptoms after the first dose other than soreness and redness around injection site that went away within 2-3 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood thyroid stimulating hormone: 4.94 miu/l on 03Feb2021 TSH level or T4 was 4.94. The patient was treated with Hydrocortisone. No further details provided about the Hydrocortisone cream that she used. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

                                                I had extreme fatigue - it lasted up until I had the stroke on May 2nd. I had some light headedness.  I was dragging for two weeks. I just wasn&#39;t right. We went to cabin in and my arms swelled and itched - a week after getting the vaccine. It was beyond big and itched. It was hard to sleep. I called the doctor. He told me to take antihistamine and topical Benadryl on it. Had the stroke on May 2nd and waited four hours and I went to Care ER part of. I was admitted and stayed two days at that point. Gave me IVs and Aspirin treatment and Lipitor. They sent me home to take Lipitor and baby aspirin. I have seen specialists after that - cardiologists and neurologists etc. They confirmed a TIA - a mild stroke. I had to be put on a heart monitor for 10 days. I have not gotten the results back from that yet. Again, because of the stroke I have had extreme fatigue ever since the shot and from the stroke. It&#39;s really bad. I have to go to the speech therapist - for Aphasia symptoms. My brain isn&#39;t working right.  I almost passed out four days after I was released. I had a synchrony event on May 7th. Went to the hospital again for one day.

He did not outright say that it was ok for her to receive the second Covid 19 vaccine. When probing for details related to the caller&#39;s stroke she reports she didn&#39;t notice it at the time but looking back she was stumbling a little at work. The first real symptom was she felt like something was coming on. She sat down and tried to put her right arm on the arm rest of the chair but her right arm had a mind of its own. Her right arm was not weak it just wouldn&#39;t go on the arm rest. She was sitting in a high chair and she was trying to put her right foot on the rail of the chair and her right leg just wouldn&#39;t do what she wanted it to do. She called for help and a girl came over to help her and when she started talking, she was slurring. 911 was called. She was taken to the emergency department and had a CT scan to make sure she didn&#39;t have a brain bleed. She did not have a brain bleed, so she was given TPA which is a major clot buster. She had another CT scan after that. She was admitted to the hospital to the Neuro-ICU. She thinks around the second day she had an MRI scan. She had blood work also, but nothing looked abnormal. She was admitted on 04Apr2021 to the hospital and discharged on 07Apr2021. She spent 3 nights in the Neuro-ICU and one night on the regular floor. When probing medical history, she reports about 6 weeks before she had the stroke, prior to receiving the Covid 19 vaccine, she had been having severe palpitations. It felt like her heart was doing cart wheels. She had long heart beats also. She did not report this to her doctor. While she was in the hospital it was determined that her heart caused her stroke. Now she is on heart medicine and has an EKG monitor in her chest. Medtronic Reveal LINQ was placed in her chest on 24May2021. The device doesn&#39;t do anything to her heart it sends a constant EKG to her doctor and it picks up more information than a regular EKG. Clarified with patient that her heart palpitations began before she received her first Covid 19 vaccine. She was now taking Aspirin 325mg daily, Atorvastatin 10mg daily, Metoprolol 25mg daily. The only prescription medication she was taking prior to the Covid 19 vaccine was Wellbutrin 300mg daily because her husband passed away a few months ago. She reported she had her Covid 19 vaccine in the hospital because she wanted to be in a hospital setting because of her anaphylactic reaction to the sulfa medication. Upon follow up, she reported that, she received first dose April 3rd and had a stroke on April 7th she stated that she was in good health and even her doctors did not know what caused it. She wanted to know what was Pfizer recommendation for her to receive the second dose because she already past the 21 days timeline. Events required a visit to, Emergency Room and Physician Office. Patient was hospitalized for 4 days. On an unspecified date, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included unknown blood test in which Nothing looked abnormal, computerised tomogram and magnetic resonance imaging both with unknown results. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of stroke. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 70-year-old elderly female received the second dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (solution for injection; Lot EL9262 and expiry information not provided) as a single dose in the right arm on 03Feb2021 at 08:30 (at 70-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included ongoing osteoporosis (Oct2020), osteopenia (2018), ongoing hypothyroidism, hysterectomy (1992; woke up from surgery, felt like a different person), sinus disorder. hypertension, iodine allergy, environmental allergies (allergic to just about everything that grows out of the ground) especially pollen, and Ex-smoker (quit smoking several years ago, lost 40 pounds), Relevant family history included tachycardia and arrhythmia and cardiac arrest in father (daddy had tachycardia; he did have an arrhythmia she thinks, his heart shocked into rhythm; her father has been dead since 2004 (at age 82). Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) for smoking cessation therapy from unspecified date; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN ) for prophylaxis from estradiol ongoing from an unspecified date; hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure from an unspecified start date to 2021; estradiol for osteoporosis ongoing from an unspecified date; levothyroxine for thyroid disorder from 2020; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC ALLERGY) for sinus disorder/ hypersensitivity, seasonal allergy ongoing from 2020; atorvastatin (LIPITOR) for blood cholesterol from an unspecified start date to 2021; amlodipine taken for hypertension from an unspecified date; estrogens conjugated (PREMARIN) for hysterectomy from an unspecified date; levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for thyroid disorder from an unspecified date; Vitamin B complex (VITAMIN B) for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; Vitamin D3 (VITAMIN D3) for bone density decreased from an unspecified date; calcium for bone density decreased from an unspecified date; and Vitamin K2. The patient previously received COVID-19 immunization with the first dose of intramuscular BNT162B2 (solution for injection; Lot EL3249 expiry information not provided) as a single dose in the right arm on 13Jan2021 at 08:30 (at 70 years-old). The patient previously received immunization with shingles vaccination with what she thinks was the second dose on 25Feb2020 (at 69-years-old). The patient previously received immunization with flu shot in Aug2020 (at 70-years-old). On 19Feb2021 at 08:30 the patient experienced a stroke and was hospitalized on that same date after physician office and emergency department visits. The patient reported that they do not know what caused the stroke but hypothesized that it was atrial fibrillation throwing a clot. The patient reported that she has never had atrial fibrillation and had never been treated by a cardiologist until she had the stroke. The patient explained that the only symptom she had was that her right hand went limp, and she could not grab or do anything with it. The patient reported that it was when she called her daughter, that she realized that she had aphasia as well. The patient explained that she had a monitor implanted in her chest, not a pacemaker, just a monitor like a chip. The patient explained that the monitor faxed anything that was going on with her heart to her cardiologist&#39;s office. The patient also mentioned that since the stroke she has put on weight/is overweight (120 pounds prior to stroke); and she has had a little more anxiety, so she does take it twice a day. A computerized tomogram (CT) scan head and neck with contrast obtained on 19Feb2021 showed two possible areas of developing peripheral infarction involving the left frontal lobe and left parietal lobe, likely embolic in nature. No thromboembolism in circle of Willis, but micro emboli are possible beyond the visuals of the CTA; no flow limiting stenosis in neck. An echocardiogram obtained on 20Feb2021 was normal. A complete blood count (CBC) and lipids obtained on unspecified dates were unknown results. On 04Jul2021 the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 95/61. The patient was discharged from the hospital on 21Feb2021. The outcome of the events stroke and hypothesized that it was atrial fibrillation throwing a clot was recovered with sequalae. The outcome of the event put on weight since the stroke/overweight was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the anxiety was unknown.

                                                Pt noted after approx 15 minutes a tingling/burning sensation of tongue At 4:45 pm.   No associated SOB, facial swelling.  She does have prior anaphylaxis reaction to pineapples for which she carries and epi Pen but has never needed to use.   Cardiac exam RRR Lungs CTA bilat HEENT, no visible erythema of face or tongue and no noteable facial swelling  She was agreeable to 25 mg dose of diphenhydramine and another 15 minute observation.    During this time, she began to feel anxious and a mild headache.  Vitals at that time were notable for bp 178/81, HR 101 and o2 sat 98%.  Still no SOB, facial swelling or other new complaint.  She felt improvement in anxiety within 5 minutes, and repeat vitals in 10 min with BP 152/83, HR 89 and O2 sats 96%  She still continued with mild sensation change of tongue, but no facial swelling.   She does have benedryl at home but I also sent her home with additional 25 mg dose in case she noted recurrent symptoms on the way home .  She understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable returning home- husband picked her up.    I will call her to check in this evening and in the morning and will provide updated recommendations regarding second dose of vaccination.     I spoke with patient at 8:09 pm - she was at home- feeling much better, however, she did take the second diphenhydramine on the way home, as she began to feel she was having some swelling between her eyes.  No SOB  Or trouble swallowing.  This improved with the second benedryl and has not recurred.    She will take an additional 50 mg benedryl before bed, and then she awakes before 6 am- if she has any residual symptoms she will take another dose.  Again, she understands to seek emergency care with any worsening symptoms, or new SOB or facial swelling. She can also use her EPI pen if needed.  She felt comfortable with this plan.    We also reviewed current CDC guidelines and she understands at this time we would not recommend she receive the second Vaccination.  She will continue to follow CDC in the event that this recommendation changes.  I will submit a VAERS report after following up with her in the morning.     ADDENDUM 2/3/21:  I spoke with patient again on 2/3/21 at 07:45 am. She is feeling almost completely back to baseline this morning, but planning to take 25 mg diphenhydramine this morning as well. She does note mild headache, which is not abnormal for her.  No residual tongue sensitivity or facial swelling.  She noted that when she got home last night, she felt very sleepy and sedated from the diphenhydramine and went to bed, and did not take an additional dose of diphenhydramine last night.  No SOB, trouble swallowing or any new complaint.  No urticaria or itching.    We reviewed current CDC recommendations to decline second vaccination given her moderate severe allergic symptoms within first 4 hours of first vaccination.  She will follow up with PCP or kidney specialist if she has any continued concern with ongoing symptoms or new issues.  She was very appreciative of the followup and care provided.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were provided. On 22Jan2021, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction. She went to the doctor and he was reluctant to give her steroids which was the normal way of treating the anaphylactic reactions because he said that the steroid would interfere with the effect of the vaccine. So, he gave her diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She had to go back to the emergency room later that day and they used epinephrine (EPIPEN) and she had to have an intravenous (IV) and other than that some medications, it had prednisolone in it. Then she had to go back yesterday and she had another IV and they sent her home with an EPIPEN. The event was assessed serious as medically significant. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

She returned to the vaccine clinic around 1415 reporting that she was having trouble breathing. Security called the charge nurses and alerted them that a patient needed assistance. Writer came out to patient who was seated in her car. We assessed patient who was visibly having difficulty breathing and was unable to respond to questions without difficulty breathing. Emergency medication box was opened and epinephrine was prepped. We assessed patients allergies and recent medications taken. Patient denied hx of breathing problems or anxiety. Pt denied chest pain. Per protocol for potential allergic reaction, 0.3ml of epi was given at approximately 1426 via IM injection in the pt&#39;s left arm. ED triage nurse was called and asked to come assist. Two ED technicians with stretcher arrived and with writer  accompanying them transported pt to ED.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

                                                Six days after receiving the vaccine I woke up on Friday, March 12, with a complete feeling of exhaustion.  Weakness was extreme in my whole left side and could barely put weight on the left side. I thought this would pass so tried to get along. The next day, Saturday, March 13, the complete exhaustion was even worse.  Trying to get out of bed was very hard. I called a friend and went to  hospital here .   I was admitted, tested, and kept for several days. The report came back that I had a series of &#34;mini&#34; strokes on the right side of my brain, affecting the left side of my body.  I could no longer walk at all without aide of person or a walker,   After that I was taken to rebab, .  I was given pt, OT, etc, and discharged several days later. No doctor or staff could tell me whether this was caused by the vaccine but the close days of administering the vaccine and the sudden onset of symptoms make me very concerned.  How can I take a 2nd vaccine without knowing if that will have a worse effect  or kill me? Can I take a different vaccine for the 2nd round, without a risk of something worse happening? Can you report to me if there is any correlation at all between this vaccine and my mini strokes?

A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 23Mar2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: Jul2021) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included low magnesium, low vitamin D, allergy to Band-Aids, skin adhesives, and allergy to polyurethane spray tan (She&#39;s had a reaction to polyurethane on wood floors at her dad&#39;s house. Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

That showed a stroke.  Then on March 31st, saw Drs.  (neurologist). Confirmed the stroke and suggested Speech Therapy.  Starting on April 19, Sppech Therapy begins.  Since Stroke, I have to sleep 12-15 hours a day.

She had her first dose of Pfizer vaccine two weeks prior to admission (3/11/21). After her vaccination, patient felt unwell and dizzy in the mornings. She felt persistent fatigue and had a decreased appetite. The week prior to admission she noticed a decrease in her urine output. She denied NSAID use. Her primary care physician ordered blood week and her Cr was found to be 16.54 and BUN of 163, phosphate of 17.5. Her last known Cr prior to her admission was 18 months prior and was 1.17. She was asked to present to the emergency room. Renal ultrasound showed no hydronephrosis or stones. Urinalysis showed 1&#43; protein, spec grav of 1.023 with a urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.09. Urine sediment was unremarkable. Her temperature was 95.6 and her BP was as low as 75/46 and she was put on a low dose of levo. CRP was 202.3. COVID was negative. CK wnl.  ANA &#43; to 1:160 (dsDNA, Smith, RNP, SS-A, SS-B all negative). Blood smear was negative. Cultures were all negative. Echo showed an EF of 68% with trivial pericardial effusion. Patient was oliguric, and then initiated on hemodialysis. Renal biopsy was performed.   The biopsy consists of one fragment which is stained with H&amp;E, PAS, Trichrome, Jones Silver, and HPS stains. Review of all stains reveals 12 glomeruli, one of which is globally sclerotic. The architecture of the kidney is well-preserved. There is  interstitial fibrosis with proportional atrophy involving 10% of the biopsy tissue. There is a focal interstitial infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes involving &lt;5% of the interstitium. The tubules show diffuse acute tubular injury.  Calcium oxalate  crystals are present in seven tubular profiles. The glomeruli show expansion of Bowman&#39;s capsule. The mesangium shows normal cellularity. The vessels show no abnormalities.   IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY:   Frozen sections are stained for IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, lambda, and fibrinogen. All immunofluorescence stains are negative.   ELECTRON MICROSCOPY:   Specimens are prepared for electron microscopy and semi-thin sections stained with toluidine blue are reviewed prior to thin sectioning for ultrastructural examination. Electron microscopy demonstrates patent capillary loops. The glomerular architecture  demonstrates segmental corrugation of basement membranes with increase in lamina rara interna.  No subepithelial deposits and no intramembranous deposits are identified. The tubules show dilated mitochondria and injury. There is segmental effacement of  foot processes. There are no subendothelial deposits. Mesangial electron dense deposits are not identified.   Patient received three dialysis treatments and Creatinine began to improved down to 1.46 within 8 days.

                                                Patient is a 71-year-old female with history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity who presents with complaint of acute onset shortness of breath.  She reports she was walking around her house earlier when she suddenly became short of breath.  She denies any chest pain, numbness or tingling but states that shortness of breath persisted.  She denies any tobacco, alcohol or drug use and states she has never had any symptoms similar to this before.  Denies any lung disease or heart disease previously.  She does have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and is on metoprolol and rosuvastatin respectively which she reports good compliance.  Denies family history of MI or strokes.  She also denies other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fevers or lower extremity edema.  In the ED vitals were found to be within normal limits.  EKG was obtained showing diffuse T wave inversions, right bundle branch block, no ST changes, no hypertrophy.  Troponin found to be elevated at 0.137, creatinine elevated at 1.3, BUN 26.  Chest x-ray was within normal limits.  Otherwise lab work was unremarkable.  She was given aspirin and Nitropaste Hospital Course:         Patient was admitted to the medical floor and remained hemodynamically stable throughout her stay. She actually remained asymptomatic and had no further shortness of breath. She was not hypoxic, at no point required supplemental oxygen. Her troponins however continued to uptrend to 0.389. Cardiology consulted, she was medically optimized with increased statin dose, therapeutic lovenox, and aspirin. Original plan was for cardiac catheterization. However, a d-dimer was ordered which returned elevated to 13.7. CTA was performed which revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary emboli with large clot burden and concern for right heart strain. Echocardiogram showed mildly dilated and hypokinetic RV with mild diastolic dysfunction with impaired relaxation. She was deemed not to be candidate for EKOS. Troponin elevation was felt to be type II NSTEMI 2/2 PE.  PE was classified as unprovoked as she has no definite risk factors for this: no prior DVT/PE, no family history of clotting disorder, no evidence of malignancy (UTD with cancer screenings and visits PCP q6m for health maintenance), no cell line abnormalities, no prolonged immobility or long trips or surgeries, no trauma, no hormone or steroid therapies or even antidepressants. She is obese, and has mild CKD. She tested negative for COVID-19 by antigen testing. The only identifiable change in her health habits recently was receiving the first COVID-vaccine dose on 3/18. We discharged her with Eliquis with instructions to taper from 10BID to 5BID after 7 days. As she will be on anticoagulation, the benefit will likely outweigh the risk of receiving the second COVID dose.  She will follow up with her PCP and hematology/oncology.

About 10:00 am, I started to experience something like knives in my stomach area.  They subsided.  I felt like I must have the flu.  By the evening, I reported to my husband that I might go to Urgent Care the following morning. About 2:00 am on Saturday, March 13 I woke up with what felt like &#39;knives&#39; around my right lung every time I breathed . My husband drove me to the ER and was later hospitalized for a Pulmonary Embolism. I was released from the hospital on Sunday, March 14.  I had a fever of at least 100 on Sunday,  Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday., with the highest being 101.4.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 71-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 10Apr2021 13:30 (Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS), tamsulosin, and iron. The patient got her first injection on Saturday, 10Apr2021 at 1:30 pm in the afternoon around 7 o&#39;clock the same day she started to itch, it was mild across her breast and stomach but her thighs and bottom legs were turning red, swelling, hives there too, and she rubbed alcohol (treatment) on this to stop the itch, that seems to helped a little bit, but the swelling was not that bad today but the redness was still there. She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Medical history included shortness of breath, asthma. Concomitant medications included albuterol (SALBUTAMOL) and budesonide/formoterol fumarate (inhalation aerosol). Patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 25Feb2021 at the age of 71 years for covid-19 immunisation and she did fine. Patient stated that lot number for shot 2 looked like EDOL71. It could be ENOL71. The lady didn&#39;t write it very well. It could be EN or ED. She was calling to report she had a terrible side effect and she want to document it in the data. She couldn&#39;t give that to computer right now, she didn&#39;t feel well, she had the Pfizer shot 1 and Pfizer shot 2. She had anaphylaxis at 30 minutes and almost she had crashed her car just after the highway. First shot was February 25, she did fine, the second shot was April 22nd and she had a horrible reaction at 30 min. Patient stated that the problem is they didn&#39;t asked her if she was short of breath or if she had any pulmonary complication and so on the second shot she didn&#39;t say anything and she forgot to say she has asthma and no one asked her. she forgot to say and so they had her sit in 15min observation and she was fine and she had gone out after she got her vaccination record card sign, she got in her car and 15min. Later while she was driving she went into anaphylaxis. She had to pull over, thank god she didn&#39;t hit anybody, she pulled over and parked and she had her inhaler with her so she used the inhaler and she got in the back seat for half an hour to make sure that she drove home, she did not call 911. Patient further stated that she wanted to put it in documentation, if someone is taking something for asthma that probably should not have the second shot one medication is not good enough, the second dose and she also woke up in the evening drenched with sweat and chills, completely sweat and that happened about 8 to 10 hours after the shot on 22Apr2021. After the shot at 12:15 pm and she had the sweat about 11 O&#39;clock at night when she had to lay down and she was shaking so badly she thought she was going to call 911, she was that sick. That&#39;s scary, patient stated &#34;I must, I did have crashed in 3 or 4 people during that.&#34; So, it was very dangerous to someone who has asthma. That was probably something in the medication that she was allergic to. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylaxis.

                                                About 8 weeks after the second Covid-19 vaccine a routine blood test for an unrelated condition indicated a severe drop in platelets to 17,000. The patient exhibited and noticed no symptoms. Follow up bloodwork over the next three days showed a further drop to 12,000. Patient was referred to Dr., a Hematology and Medical Oncology specialist. She immediately had the patient go to the Emergency Room and then had her admitted to Hospital. The patient was diagnosed with Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). At the time, specialist noted that she had a second patient with the identical symptoms who received their second Pfizer shot a month or so earlier. During the hospital stay and for a few weeks after, the patient received infusions of Rituximab and was placed on the oral medication Promacta. At the end of the 14-day stay, the patient&#39;s platelet count increased to 17,000. Over the next three weeks as an outpatient, while on Promacta, the platelet count rose to over 500,00 and the patient was told to discontinue all use of Promacta. The patient is receiving weekly blood tests and her status is being monitored.

                                                71 yo F with RA and GERD, received the second Pfizer covid vaccine on 6/15, then was brought by the family on 6/23 with progressively worse symptoms of weakness, nausea and vomiting and  fall/near syncope at home.  Prior to admission, patient reported dizziness and weakness to the PCP, meclizine prn was prescribed, but this didn&#39;t help.  On admission patient was found to have NSTEMI and started on Heparin drip, ASA, Plavix, beta-blocker. Was to have a cardiac cath on 6/25 but noted to have change in MS/ acute confusion and right hemiparesis. CT brain followed by MRI brain showed extensive acute infarcts involving the b/l centrum semiovale, corona radiata, b/l cerebellum, b/l basal ganglia and b/l thalamus.  On 6/28 labs also show an acute increase in creatinine/AKI and patient had an episode of gross hematuria on 6/29.  Heparin drip and Plaxix were d/c&#39;ed , ASA continued.  Heme evaluation is requested to comment on possible thrombophilia associated with Pfizer covid vaccine.   Exam - somnolent elderly patient in bed, answers some questions (name, place), but confused about time, with flaccid RUE, also some weakness noted in the LLE, normal S1,2 no n/r/g, clear lungs, soft abdomen w/o masses.   Imaging reviewed with Neuroradiology suggested a cardioembolic picture. Wonder if she also had embolization to the kidney with AKI and renal infarcts w hematuria?  CTA neck does not show significant ats disease to the aortic arch or neck arteries.  Renal US with doppler exam was also normal.  TEE was done on 7/2 and was a normal study, w/o PFO or intracardiac clot.  Patient also had a loop recorder to evaluate for occult arrhythmias.   This patient never had thrombocytopenia and/or a TTP-like picture reported with the Astra-Zeneca or Janssen vaccines.  Heparin induced platelet Abs were 0.158.

She was beginning to bloat as her kidneys were not working at all anymore, she was no longer urinating. she was scheduled to have a dialysis port put in and she started dialysis. she was given medication and was sent to a rehab facility for a few weeks where she made no progress at all, she was still weak and unable to walk. due to her inability to walk she was sent home from the rehab, our family had to rally around her to help keep her clean, no bed was sent to us, no commode, we had to find money for all of these things, she quickly got bed sores and we tried all we could do to care for her with little help there was home health coming to see her twice a week, and we repeatedly asked if someone could look into the vaccine doing this to her no one cared to hear our suspicions of the vaccine doing this to our mother, she went to the dialysis clinic 3 times a week all the while paying for her own 800 dollar a week gurney transportation due to her inability to walk, on july 15th she finally got to see her dr, upon taking her vital signs they found no pulse, no blood pressure and no pulse ox but the dr did not seem to think  this was a good reason to go to the hospital. we asked if the vaccine did this to her, the dr laughed it off, she went back home and was very tired, she went to sleep and the next morning when my father tried to wake her up for dialysis, she would not wake, 911 was called and she was once again rushed to the hospital, where her heart stopped within minutes of arriving.we asked the people in the ER if there was anyway we could talk to someone about the vaccine doing this to her. our mother is dead!! we were advised to call the health department, they told us to call the cdc, and i was directed to the compensation fund

This 71-year-old female consumer (patient) reported for herself that she received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6199, Expiry date: 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 07Mar2021, the patient experienced excruciating headache and on 10Mar2021, she experienced vaginal bleeding. She does not think call handler can help, but she had the first dose of the shot and the side effects, aside from what was listed, she has excruciating headache, four to five days after the dose and bleeding, clarified to vaginal bleeding, like menstrual cycle. Both started a few days after the shot. She further clarified and said she got the first dose date of vaccine 04Mar2021 and 3 to 4 days after was when her headache started. She later clarified the excruciating headache started on 07Mar2021. She states the headache was still ongoing. Bleeding started yesterday morning. She states the bleeding was still ongoing. Caller states she will not do the second dose. She said it will kill her. She regrets that she did it because it was unproven. We only know what reactions are today but she does not know what is going to happen to her in the future. Besides it was so frightening. She said she was just rambling right now, maybe in a year or in the fall when they have new stuff coming out, she does not know but it was not proven. Outcome was not resolved for both the events.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021040024) on 18Jan2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 19Jan2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (Hashimotos&#39; Disease), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease) and HAEMORRHAGE (she has a bleeding disorder/ a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding) in 72-year-old female patient who received apixaban (ELIQUIS) for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included COVID-19 VACCINE for an unknown indication. On an unknown date, the patient started ELIQUIS (unknown route) and COVID-19 VACCINE (Intramuscular). On an unknown date, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (seriousness criterion medically significant), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (seriousness criterion medically significant), HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant), CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY (allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes) and DERMATITIS CONTACT (allergies to adhesive, and polymers). The action taken with ELIQUIS (Unknown) was unknown. At the time of the report, AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS, MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, HAEMORRHAGE, CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY and DERMATITIS CONTACT outcome was unknown. Consumer reported that she had read the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and have some questions to the &#34;What should you mention to your vaccination provider&#34;. Caller mentioned that she has allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes, adhesive, and polymers such as the angio-seal that was used on her for a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding. She has irritation from the polymer and described it as a sponge that was meant to be absorbed for a month. Her first question was does the COVID-19 vaccine contain latex, mold (polymers) and adhesive? Response: For latex. For mold (polymer) and adhesive: &#34;A review of the ingredients list on the product label show that mold (polymer) and adhesive are not part of the formulation, however, Pfizer does not specifically manufacture the vaccine to be free of mold (polymer) and adhesive, therefore, we cannot assure that it was &#34;mold (polymer)-free and adhesive free&#34;. We cannot guarantee that minute amounts of substances are not contained in raw materials obtained from our suppliers. She had the PPSD23/Pneumonia 23 vaccine last 05Jan2021 and was told not to get the COVID-19 vaccine for 14 days. Is it because of the injection site or is it for systemic reasons? Consumer mentioned that she was on ELIQUIS. She has Hashimoto&#39;s Disease and Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease. She said that she was not immunocompromised. She mentioned that she has a bleeding disorder. The Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can only be administered as an intramuscular injection For ELIQUIS (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Reporter&#39;s causality assessment was not provided.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Causality assessment for ELIQUIS: Events: Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Contrast media allergy, Topical adhesive allergy, Mixed connective tissue disease were considered unrelated while bleeding was considered related.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had autoimmune thyroiditis, mixed connective tissue disease and hemorrhage after receiving apixaban therapy. This patient also had COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the anticoagulant action of apixaban, its role in the event hemorrhage is considered as possible. Based on the etiology of the reported events, auto immune thyroiditis and mixed connective tissue disorder are considered not related to apixaban.

A 72-year-old female consumer received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL9262), via an unknown route, on 23Jan2021 (at 13:15) at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included high cholesterol, high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation (she had been treated for Afib in the past but had been off of all medications for many months). Relevant concomitant medications included atorvastatin for high cholesterol and metoprolol for high blood pressure. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. Within 24 hours of the injection, on 24Jan2021 at 13:30, atrial fibrillation reoccurred. Physician office visit was done. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the event included apixaban (ELIQUIS) and dofetilide. An electrocardiogram (EKG) was done and results were unknown. Post-vaccination COVID test was not performed. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

                                                Two days after vaccination, I experienced vaginal bleeding which has continued until today (2/21/21), and has shown no signs of stopping.  Question:  should I take second dose on March 5 or at any time thereafter?

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

All blood tests do not show that it came from a DVT or or that it was inherited therefore, can not show where the clot came from. It is unknown or considered &#34;Unprovoked&#34; due to unknown cause. This causes a concern for an adverse reaction from the vaccine

                                                the problem was a bloodclot; slight swelling of right foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 72-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure and allergy to tape. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; olmesartan; metformin; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to BNT162b2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 13Mar2021 15:00, the patient noticed slight swelling of right foot and on 14Mar2021, the swelling increased so the patient texted the nurse who arranged appointment. The nurse said to contact the doctor and the patient spoke with registered nurse (RN) on duty who told the patient to go to the emergency room (ER) because the symptoms indicated the problem was a blood clot. The ER doctor examined and ordered an ultrasound and the results confirmed blood clot. The patient was given a prescription for blood thinner to take for 21 days (times/day, 15mg) and was told to make an appointment with the primary doctor. The patient&#39;s doctor was on spring break and she was walked in to see another doctor who said swelling looked improved and showed her where the clots were located. The patient saw her primary doctor today and she ordered a visit with a hematologist as soon as possible (ASAP) because of concerns about possible underlying issues. The outcome of events, slight swelling of right foot and the problem was a blood clot was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

                                                I started being really short of breath and felt pain/inflammation in lower body. I remember telling my brother I hurt everywhere below my waist; was just home from work where on my feet unless I sit down to rest. It all culminated with increased breathlessness and went to emergency at hospital at 8:30 pm on April 22, 2021.  Diagnosis was MANY pulmonary embolisms, some large. I have taken week long road trips for the past several years with  hours and hours at the wheel with no problems.   It just seems like a real strange coincidence of the vaccine and subsequent symptoms.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER8733, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, on 29Mar2021 11:45, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing latex allergy (developed welts where the straps met the skin) diagnosed 20-30 years ago; ongoing dye allergy (developed warm soreness to leg, tightness in the chest, could not breathe) diagnosed many years ago; sulphite allergy (diagnosed about 1975-1980; cannot eat processed foods, bleached foods, frozen pre-made foods; tries to eat only single item foods; last anaphylactic reaction after eating olive oil at a restaurant because it had sulphites in it; Mother was possibly allergic to sulphites; Son also allergic to sulphites); and blood pressure that runs low. The patient previously took epinephrine and experienced epinephrine allergy; ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) and experienced Cipro Allergy (eyes closed, got puffy, couldn&#39;t breathe); amoxicillin for abscessed tooth and had a reaction because of the sulphites in it; epinephrine (EPIPEN) and experienced epinephrine allergy (does not use it anymore); plantago ovata (METAMUCIL) which she then found out the orange one had sulphites. Historical vaccine included flu shot for immunization and she experienced 104-degree temperature and was sick as a dog and she went to the emergency room (she had flu shot maybe 3 times). Ongoing concomitant medication included multivitamins. The patient got her first dose of BNT162B2 on 29Mar2021 at 11:45. On the same day, once she got home, she became really, really tired/wiped out tired; was so sleepy; experienced sore arm/her arm started to hurt; was nauseous; had sore throat/throat hurt; eyes half closed/eyes closing and puffy face. On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced elevated pulse/her pulse got too high/pulse was 165 beats per minute/climbed up to 195. Her heart rate was 194 at some point for a couple of minutes then stayed at 165 for a long time. She hoped she wasn&#39;t having a heart attack. She had tightness in her chest, wasn&#39;t feeling good and was coughing. She stayed in her bed to wait out her symptoms. These lasted for 10 minutes (as reported). She started meditating hoping her heart rate would decrease and it did after about 15-20 minutes. The patient also felt feverish/felt hotter than usual. Before she took the vaccine on 29Mar2021, her temperature was at 96. She stated that her temperature usually runs low as 95-06 degrees. She also felt like her sinuses were congested; was sore; had puffy, bubbled up arms, inflamed. The patient hoped it was not a blood clot she developed. At the time of the report, the patient stated that her heart rate was 61 beats per minute, earlier it was in the 70s; and her temperature was at 96.3. Her second dose is scheduled on 19Apr2021 and mentioned that if these were her reactions with the first dose, she is questioning getting the second dose. The outcome of &#34;blood clot&#34;, &#34;hoped she wasn&#39;t having a heart attack&#34;, &#34;Wasn&#39;t feeling well&#34;, &#34;Tightness in chest&#34;, cough, and sinuses congested was unknown. The patient recovered from &#34;Drenched in sweat/sweating/sweating like a dog in the middle of the night&#34;, and &#34;Elevated Pulse/high pulse/pulse was 165 beats per minute/climbed up to 195&#34; on 30Mar2021; and was recovering from &#34;Sore Arm/her arm started to hurt&#34;, and &#34;eyes half closed/eyes closing&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been obtained. Additional information is expected.

A 72-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number and expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 04Jan2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart valve replacement, thyroid issues and headache. Concomitant medications included medications in the last two weeks (unspecified). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on an unknown date for COVID-19 immunization. On 24Feb2021 12:00 PM, the patient suffered a stroke - blood clots in the brain. Had brain scans earlier in the year for headaches but nothing found. The events resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. The patient was hospitalized for the events for 7 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included surgery to break and remove the clot. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Public Health Clinic facility. Patient was not pregnant. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient is a 72 y.o. female with chronic diastolic heart failure, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, depression with anxiety, who presented with shortness of breath on exertion.  CTA chest was performed, showing filling defects in  secondary and tertiary pulmonary arterial branches in bilateral lower lobes as well as right upper lobe.  Patient was admitted for management of acute bilateral pulmonary emboli.  Patient was started on Lovenox 1 mg/kg twice daily; transitioned over to oral apixaban for discharge. TTE obtained, without evidence of right heart strain. Patient is a 72 y.o. female who presents to the office today stating &#34;I do not feel so good&#34;.

Denies any chest pain or pressure but reports noting her heart rate was elevated up to 150.  She states her O2 sat at home was 97% on room air.  She checked her blood pressure which was not abnormal but cannot recall the number.   She was recently diagnosed with a PE for which she was hospitalized, see previous note.  She is concerned as she feels perhaps her Covid vaccine initially received on 3/4/2021 could have caused her blood clot.  Her second dose was received on 3/31/2021 and has since not been feeling well EKG in the office with new onset A. fib relation noted, rapid ventricular rate with a pulse of 152 bpm.  911 was called and patient transferred to the ER for further evaluation and recommendations.

Of note, patient had received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 4/10/2021.  She had scheduled this primary care provider appointment due to waxing and waning blurred vision of her right eye, with associated right-sided headache that had been ongoing over the last week.  Patient reports that on the day of arrival she had not felt well, felt slightly weak and fatigued, but denied shortness of breath, chest pain or heart palpitations.  Per ER notes, patient was instructed on vagal maneuvers while she was in the ambulance, and had converted to sinus rhythm by the time of her arrival to the emergency room.  Per review of her telemetry on the day of discharge, patient did have one short episode of PAF on 4/15/2021, spontaneously converting to sinus rhythm, as well was intermittent PACs.  Her home lisinopril was changed to Coreg, without further episodes of RVR and with good blood pressure control.   In regards to her headache, patient underwent an MRI of the brain, which was negative for acute findings; she had no temporal tenderness, and ESR was within normal limits.  She did improve symptomatically with administration of Tylenol and Zofran for her corresponding nausea/vomiting.  On the day of discharge, patient was feeling much better, and stable for discharge.  An appointment with doctor of ophthalmology was offered to patient for 4/16/2021, however due to transportation issues, this was rescheduled for 4/20/2021.  She was instructed on changes in her medication, as well as encouraged to schedule an appointment with her established cardiologist.  All questions and concerns were addressed.

                                                Covid 19 vaccine exacerbated her chronic fatigue syndrome; Covid 19 vaccine exacerbated her chronic fatigue syndrome; atrial fibrillation; tachycardia/ heartrate got was 222 beats per minute; missing heartbeats; chills; fever; fatigue; lethargic; felt crummy; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13Apr2021 15:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 72 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing chronic fatigue syndrome at age 32 (she had been doing natural therapy and had gotten herself to a stable period but her chronic fatigue syndrome was still an issue sometimes), atrial fibrillation (had been admitted to the hospital because of it, she was not admitted to the hospital when she had atrial fibrillation after receiving her Covid 19 vaccine). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included the first flu vaccine she every received sent her over the moon. Clarified she was in bed sick after receiving the flu vaccine. Patient was calling because she didn&#39;t do well with her first Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. After the Covid 19 vaccine she experienced chills and fever on 13Apr2021 for a couple days. Then she had fatigue on 13Apr2021and that was a few days of her own chronic fatigue syndrome flaring up. She also had some problems with her heart like atrial fibrillation and tachycardia on 18Apr2021. She saw her cardiologist and he wanted her to do the dye stress test where she ran on the treadmill. The day her stress test was scheduled was the same day as her second Covid 19 vaccine. She was calling to find out if she can get the dye at her stress test and run on the treadmill and get the Covid 19 vaccine on the same day. Or does she need to put the stress test off for a couple weeks. She felt like the dye from the stress test and the Covid 19 vaccine might be too many chemicals in her body for one day. She felt like the Covid 19 vaccine exacerbated her chronic fatigue syndrome. She reported that something as simple as to much sugar or to much sun or exertion can also exacerbate her chronic fatigue syndrome. She was prepared in her thinking that the Covid 19 vaccine would be difficult for her because of her history with chronic fatigue syndrome. She had chills and a fever for a few days after the Covid 19 vaccine. She did not take her temperature to get a recorded number. She was lethargic and really felt crummy on 13Apr2021 for about the first 3 days. On day 4 she was better. Then the heart stuff started. Clarified, the atrial fibrillation and tachycardia started. She took medicine as needed for her atrial fibrillation and tachycardia. She had the atrial fibrillation and the tachycardia for about 3 days in a row. She reported she was stable now. She was able to monitor her heartrate on her watch. She then printed out her heart rate readings from her  watch to take to her doctor. The highest her heartrate got was 222 beats per minute and that happened a couple times. Her watch only showed her heart rate as 150 beats per minute but when she printed the information it showed her true heart rate. She did see an electrophysiologist before she received her first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine. She was preparing herself for if anything was going to go wrong when she received the vaccine, she wanted to know what to do. She wanted to prepared in case the Covid 19 vaccine caused her any trouble. She was prescribed Diltiazem by her cardiologist to take as needed when she was having the tachycardia and atrial fibrillation. She was taking 15mg three times a day on the three days that she had the atrial fibrillation and tachycardia and it helped. She received her first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine on 13Apr2021 and according to her watch she started missing heartbeats on 14Apr2021. The atrial fibrillation and the really bad heart stuff started on 18Apr2021 and went on until 22Apr2021. She would say her heart issues started to resolve on the afternoon of the 22Apr2021. She was still missing heart beats according to her watch but nothing bad. She saw her cardiologist on Friday, 23Apr2021 and at that appointment she was in normal sinus rhythm. She has had some ups and downs since the 23Apr2021. Her second Covid 19 vaccine was scheduled for 04May2021 at 11:00AM. She did have a 3D echocardiogram and based on that, the doctor wanted to rule out any blocked arteries and that&#39;s why she&#39;s doing the stress test. AEs (atrial fibrillation and tachycardia) require a visit to Physician Office. Outcome of events chills, fever, lethargic, felt crummy was recovered on 17Apr2021, and the other events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose at the age of 72-years-old via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 27Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (blood pressure high) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, pacemaker from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included a 10 mg high blood pressure pill (unspecified). The patient reported that after her COVID shot on 27Jan2021, she had the headache, achy, fatigue on unspecified dates; but she know that her heart rate was higher, she was exercising. It was higher than it normally was and her pacemaker, she have a pacemaker and she happen to have a pacemaker check 4 days after her COVID shot which they monitor every 7 months and it was working and it was pacing 100 percent of the time which was much higher than it had been before and the week after the shot she started having pain in her back, in her shoulder and it was hard to breathe, it&#39;s hard when she breathe and by the next day she ended up in the emergency room where she was diagnosed with pneumonia, tachycardia and pericarditis all on unspecified dates. She further reported that she was still suffering from them.  She have some other tests on the 04Feb2021in the ER, her hemoglobin was 14.6 and on 10Mar2021 it was 11.6 so, it gone down 3 points, by 04Feb2021 and 10Mar2021, her White blood count went down from 16,600 to 11,400 and her Sed rate count (ESR or sed rate) was 48 (clarification unknown). She was very glad that she had the vaccination and was not sad that she had it but she was very ill, she was unable to do anything but lie around for about 25 days from 27Jan2021 to 25Mar2021 so for 2 months, and she still have pain in her chest not as bad as she had, it&#39;s not like intense with every single breathe, it&#39;s only if she take deep breath. She had the second shot of the vaccine on 17Feb2021 and got sicker faster after the second shot. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included haemoglobin: 14.6 on 04Feb2021, haemoglobin: 11.6 on 10Mar2021, red blood cell sedimentation rate: 48 on an unspecified date, white blood cell count: 16,600   on 04Feb2021, white blood cell count: 11,400 on 10Mar2021 and heart rate: higher on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken which included treatment with prednisone, flecainide, antibiotic for pneumonia and some kind of morphine pill for pain (given in the emergency room). On 24Mar2021, she had a cardioversion to try to deal with the tachycardia and in order to do that she had to take Eliquis. The outcome of erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased and white blood cell high was unknown and for the other events was not recovered.   Information on Batch number/Lot number has been requested.

                                                stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s sister). A 72-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 15Jan2021 at 18:30 (Lot Number: EL1283) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included rabeprazole sodium (ACIPHEX) taken for acid digestion. On 31Jan2021 at 08:00, patient had a stroke (very mild stroke with just some care needed but, not much). She was not able to receive the second dose because she was in the hospital. Caller would like to consult on some guidelines for receiving the vaccine after 6 weeks. The reported wanted to know if the patient need to start all over again. The patient was hospitalized for stroke (cerebrovascular accident) from 31Jan2021 to 03Feb2021 and then went to Rehabilitation right after and was there for 2 weeks. She was currently doing speech therapy because that is what she qualifies for. Things were improving, she has been released from physical rehab but still qualifies for the speech therapy. Outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information and the advanced age, the event stroke is considered more likely an intercurrent medical condition that was unrelated to BNT162B2. Additional information including detailed event information, relevant present and past medical conditions would be needed to better assess the case. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The arm is weak and limp when picking up items. Pressing the lumps/clots is painful.

                                                3/9 MHN, admitted day after covid vaccine with weakness/SOB. Patient with history of small cell lung cancer metastatic on chemotherapy, COPD, diabetes, Sjogren&#39;s who presents with shortness of breath, confusion, and generalized fatigue as well as fall 1 week ago found to have recurrent pleural effusion, T7 fracture, new metastases, UTI. Shortness of breath: Suspicion is that this is related to malignancy plus effusion.  Shortness of breath markedly improved after removal of Transudative fluid, 470cc obtained on thora 3/10 with cytology negative. Encephalopathy: Daughter notes that she has been more confused.  The patient is off on her timeline of details.  CT shows no evidence of brain metastases nor does recent MRI.  Chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure: Patient is on 3 L of oxygen at baseline and she is currently at baseline. Generalized weakness: Her neuro exam is nonfocal aside from her confusion of timeline.  CT and MRI have been unremarkable.  I discussed her T7 fracture with spine surgery who recommends CT of entire spine which showed additional metastases.  Patient has no pain and has declined the need for brace. Metastatic small cell lung cancer: Patient admits that she does not like to talk much about the big picture however her daughter at bedside did speak with me outside the room and understands that she may have a poor prognosis.  UTI: With increased frequency/urgency/incontinence.  There is trace leuk esterase on UA.  She has been on ceftriaxone but urine culture showing 80,000 colonies of Enterococcus.  Changed to vancomycin.  I discussed with the microbiology lab who stated that sensitivities would not be available until 3/13.  Discharged with sensitivities pending initially with plan for amoxicillin but given interaction with methotrexate change to Macrobid. Normocytic anemia: Likely related to malignancy and chemotherapy.  No blood loss has been noted.  She received 1 unit RBCs prior to discharge.

                                                Daughter reporting after her mother&#39;s death .  She got her vaccine and called her daughter in the afternoon around 2:00 and told her that she got it.  At 6:00 she received a VM where she said that she was having joint pain and wanted to know if she could call her doctor to get her joint pain medicine.  Later that evening her daughter told her that was why she was put on the Hydroxychloroquine and they wanted her to see the rheumatologist.  She complained of pain a lot, but she specifically asked for joint pain medicine.  On the 22nd on another VM her daughter noticed that she sounded raspy hoarse sounding and congested and had a cough.  Then subsequent messages after that the hoarseness was there that didn&#39;t go away.  Her daughter took her to the dentist on 4/15/21 and she remembered that the caregiver told her that she did not want to go to the dentist as she did not feel good.  She did not like to get out of the apartment.  Then on 4/19/21 she was admitted to the hospital and that she had pneumonia.  They were going to discharge her home and she was going to pick her up on 4/22/21, and then they called her back and told her that she sounded junky and they were going to keep her another day.  She made arrangements to pick her up on Friday and then her oxygens dropped and would discharge her on Monday.    She normally gets oxygen 1 liter of oxygen only at night, and when she was admitted her oxygen levels were low and they put her on 6 liters when she was admitted.  Then she was weaned off oxygen completely, and her daughter informed them that she slept with oxygen and that&#39;s when they were talking about going home.  On Friday she dropped her oxygen level into the 60&#39;s  On Saturday 4/24/21 she was on 9 liters of oxygen and the doctor came in and said that she was on 14.  By Saturday night she was on the Critical care Unit, but her on Vancomycin and was on Vapotherm on high-flow oxygen and she had maxed out at 40 liters at 100% oxygen.   They talked to the daughter about putting her on ventilation and thought it was toxicity to Vancomycin and other things and couldn&#39;t figure it out and said that it was some sort of inflammation of her lungs.  They put her on high levels of steroids and was then taken off of high-flow oxygen and then was still on 20% liters.  They recommended hospice and palliative care.  They decided to bring her home on Hospice with 15 liters of oxygen.  It was up and down levels.  She was given steroids when she came home on Hospice and was given steroids.  She then started to decline and hospice nurse came and she was admitted to Hershey and they repeated her chest x-ray and COVID testing, and that her lungs were so scarred there was nothing that they could do for her.  They tested her for COVID multiple times, the CAT Scans came back that it was worsening and consistent with COVID but tested negative twice while was there.  She was then sent to Hospital and tested again and was negative, and she passed on 5/10/2021.    HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS: She was admitted to  on 4/19/21 discharged home on hospice on 5/6/21.    She was admitted to Medical Center on 5/6/21 and she died on 5/10/21 at 5:48 PM.

Two days later, I had an episode with my Afib being active (the propafenone had been managing this).  After my second dose, I had chills, low grade fever, feeling generally sick, all this was normal per CDC.  However, on the 19th I woke with full scale Atrial Fibrillation and my blood pressure was elevated.  Both kept rising until my BP was 173/108, I was very dizzy and faint.  I called 911, who transported me to Hospital ER (because my heart rate was extremely elevated and BP high).  My heart rate eventually went back to normal, BP still higher than it should be.  For the past week, my BP has fluctuated between being normal to being high.  The past two days, it has been normal.  The only explanation was a result of the 2nd vaccine as they could find no other problems in doing x-rays of my heart/lungs and blood work.  It was a bit scary because high blood pressure affects my kidneys and was the cause of the stroke in my eye last year.

                                                Within 1 week of receiving COVID vaccine,I started having left leg pain that lasted until hospitalization. I?ve had sciatica before and thought it was this. After second COVID vaccine(03/02/2021),started getting shortness of breath  that continued to get worse. Finally, in mid-April, along with the shortness of breath and left leg pain, I started getting right,mid back pain that radiated to right chest and shoulder. On April 21,2021, I  could no longer tolerate the chest and back pain and drove myself to ER and Urgent Care. The Dr. ordered a CT Angio of chest and determined I had bilateral pulmonary embolism and sent me by ambulance to Hospital.

A 72-years-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot ER2613 or EL2613), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in upper arm on 15Apr2021 at the age of 72 years as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation from 2017, diagnosed around 4 years ago, stroke from 11Sep2001, osteoarthritis from 2019 diagnosed around 2 years ago. Concomitant medications included verapamil hydrochloride (VERAPAMIL ER) at 120mg for atrial fibrillation, apixaban (ELIQUIS) at 5 mg twice a day to prevent a stroke. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot ENB208 or EN6208) received on 22Mar2021 at the age of 72 years for Covid-19 immunization. She had underlying Atrial Fibrillation and had 2 episodes where she sent to the ER after getting vaccinated with the 2nd dose. The first time the patient went into atrial fibrillation was on 24Apr2021 and she had to visit the Emergency room. Patient was given multiple IVs and had to stay in the emergency room for 24 hours. Patient was sent home on 25Apr2021 but she had an old stroke so she was unsure if they formally admitted her to the hospital or not. The second time patient went into atrial fibrillation she had to visit the Emergency room. It was on 15May2021 and the patient had to stay there for a little bit but then came out of atrial fibrillation and was sent home that same day, 15May2021. Patient had been out of atrial fibrillation since the 15May2021. Outcome of event was recovered on 15May2021.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Feb2021 11:30 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes, ongoing blood pressure high, coronary artery disease, spinal stenosis, arthritis, Penicillin allergy (doesn&#39;t have the product that was back in 1969, Drug hypersensitivity), bee sting, shrimp, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing hypertension. Concomitant medication included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes; insulin detemir (LEVEMIR) taken for diabetes, candesartan taken for hypertension; nifedipine (PROCARDIA [NIFEDIPINE]) taken for hypertension; carvedilol taken for hypertension; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for cholesterol; aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]); vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]); and colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]). The patient previously took epipen for stung by a bee (stuck that EpiPen in her thigh). The patient experienced she was having an anaphylactic reaction, feeling so bad on 17Feb2021, she got a woozy after the vaccine and it was pained all over on 16Feb2021. Patient stated she received the first dose of the vaccine on 16Feb2021. Caller states she had a severe reaction so dramatic that she has decided that she is not going to take the second dose of the vaccine. When she went in they asked if she had an allergy.  She said bee sting, Penicillin, and shrimp. They responded and told her if she had a reaction they had an EpiPen there for her. She has not had an EpiPen injection since 1987. She did not remember what it was like. Back in 1987, she got stung by a bee. She felt so bad. She felt that if she closed her eyes she would die. Her daughter called 911 and they came, but they did not have the EpiPen. Her son called her family doctor who came over with the EpiPen. He said she was having a severe reaction to the bee sting. He saved her life. When she went in on Tuesday she got a woozy after the vaccine. It was not near as bad as what she experienced in 1987. She stayed there 45 minutes and they brought her water and a bagel. She drank the water but did not eat the bagel. She went home and was fine all night. The next morning about 8AM, she started feeling so bad. She felt worse than she did in 1987. She felt like she was going to die if she closed her eye. It did not dawn on her that she was having an anaphylactic reaction. Her friend sent her a text that had four versions of a scripture. The scripture said has different plans for her. She read that to herself and started to feel better. She attributed it to saving her life. She told her cardiologist she is 72 years old and has underlying conditions and she does not want to go through that again. In 1987 the doctor came in the house and the fireman was already there. The doctor came over to her and he just stuck that EpiPen in her thigh. Everything in the body went to the top of her head. She felt like if she could open her head she could let the pain and everything out. Feeling so bad: It lasted for about 15 to 30 minutes. Then caller clarified her friend texted her at 9:26AM, so it may have lasted an hour to an hour and a half. She ached all over. Her body felt dead. It was pained all over. Everything was trapped inside her head. She went to the cardiologist and all her numbers were fine. She told him she was not going to take another shot. She is going to go back for a stress test because she has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. She has an appointment with her primary care doctor, on 10Mar2021 and will see what he has to say. Time the Vaccination Was Given: her appointment was at 11:30AM. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. The adverse events require a visit to Physician Office, She felt better and decided not to take the other shot. She ran it by her doctors. She has an appointment. She has not cancelled it yet. She wants to find out what the ramifications would be if she did not take the second one. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations: She does not have a spleen. She has had her flu shot. She has not had the shingles vaccination. It is not time for Pneumovax. She keeps up and follows her doctors. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included numbers: unknown results. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 73-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown), via unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 04Jun2021 (at the age of 72-year-old), as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing congestive heart failure, ongoing atrial fibrillation, ongoing flutter and does experience shortness of breath (ongoing), ongoing chest pain, and racing heartbeat at times (ongoing). Concomitant medications included Warfarin   sodium (COUMADIN). On 04Jun2021 after vaccination, when the patient by reaching to home experienced itching and rash that initially was on her left arm and knuckles and moved to her right arm where she got the vaccine. Those symptoms have since resolved with no further concerns. A couple hours after the administration of the vaccine, the patient experienced severe pain in her chest. It was reported that the pain was an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10, and her heart was really racing. The patient had shortness of breath, which she had with her problems, but it was a little more. The patient stated that she has a history of congestive heart failure, with Atrial Fibrillation and flutter and does experience shortness of breath, chest pain, and racing heartbeat at times however these symptoms were exacerbated after having the 1st dose administered. The patient stated her symptoms almost put her in the Emergency Room but she held off on going and chose to wait her symptoms out. It calmed down so the patient did not go to the emergency room. Later, on the patient had a chest pain but not as severe. It was reported that in the morning and over the weekend it was minor. The patient started cramping in her abdomen and had diarrhea at night and had it again on Saturday and she had some yesterday (06Jun2021). This morning (07Jun2021) the patient had it and then around 2:00 she started having belly pain/abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient wanted to know if there were any contraindications with receiving the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine in conjunction with Coumadin use. Response was provided for the same as: When vaccinating Persons with Increased Bleeding Risk, providers often avoid giving intramuscular injections (not just this vaccine) or choose alternative routes because of the risk for hematoma formation after injections. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine should only be administered as an intramuscular injection. Also reported that there was no contraindication listed upon the package insert for patients receiving blood thinners and getting the COVID19 vaccine as well as provided information regarding use with blood thinners. It was reported that one provider advised her to not get the vaccine, however her cardiologist recommended her to get the vaccine due to risks vs benefits. However, the patient was waiting call back from her Cardiologist regarding her chest pain and racing heart symptoms at that time. The patient wants to make sure the physician doesn&#39;t want to see her. The patient was overall not felt well and was fatigued as well and she wanted to know if those symptoms are commonly seen or have they been reported. She also stated that she gets tired easily due to heart congestion but she was feeling more tired than usual. Patient does not usually get headaches and also got a headache on Friday after getting her COVID19 vaccine. The patient wanted to know how long her side effects may last because already she was scheduled dental procedure tomorrow (08Jun2021) wants to make sure everything was okay, and also she wanted to know more information regarding the reported cases of Myocarditis. The patient was more concerned and worried about getting the second dose because with the first dose she experienced events and she stated that her second dose was scheduled on the 25Jun2021. It was reported that when the patient&#39;s husband visited for vaccination, they asked whether he was on blood thinner. But the patient was mentioning that she (his wife) was on blood thinner coumadin, however they did not ask her regarding the blood thinners. Even the patient had not informed about the blood thinners to them. The patient queried about whether they give a different type of vaccine for blood thinners or its okay to take normal vaccine. The patient stated that she know that if she got a covid vaccine she may die because of her heart and lungs. It was reported that her stomach was queasy. The events congestive heart failure exacerbated, Atrial Fibrillation, however these symptoms were exacerbated after having the 1st dose were assessed as medically significant. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed; Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on March 08, 2021. About a week later she started complaining of feeling fatigued, confused, and disoriented some days. These symptoms progressively got worse over the next 3 months. She received her 2nd dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on April 05, 2021. A week later she mentioned waking up more disoriented in the mornings and would look at her hands and think to herself, &#34;Who&#39;s hands are these?&#34; She said she felt like she wasn&#39;t in her right mind. Soon after this she felt she couldn&#39;t go to the grocery store alone or drive because she might get lost. She never had symptoms of Dementia prior to March 2021. On May 10, 2021 I noticed she was moving slower and using walls to guide her through her home as she walked. She mentioned she felt more fatigued at this time. On the weekend of May 21, 2021 we took a trip for her birthday and she was mentioning how it was a struggle for her to pack for the trip because she couldn&#39;t think clearly and had made a mess in her room trying to find her clothes. She was a very tidy &amp; organized person, so this was very unusual. A week after the trip she mentioned losing some strength in her left leg and needing to lean on walls as she walked through her home. On June 4, 2021 the weakness got worse and she mentioned she felt more &#34;off&#34; and wanted to shower before heading to the hospital to be evaluated - when she got out of the shower she completely lost strength in her left leg and fell to the ground, but was conscious. She was taken to Hospital where a CT scan was done that showed brain swelling and a mass. She was then transported to Medical Center where an MRI was done, confirming the swelling and 4cm mass - doctors there believed it could be a Glioblastoma and mentioned it is very aggressive.  When asked if the vaccine may have caused this, we were quickly dismissed and told there could be no connection at all. After further research we found that GBM (Glioblastoma) could grow as quickly as .5mm per day and when calculating the time between her 1st dose and her hospitalization (approx. 90 days) it equated to 4.5cm, her mass was 4cm. Even if there was a mass there before her vaccine, there is reason to believe it may have been aggravated by the vaccine.   Surgery was suggested, but after 4 days she expressed that she wanted to opt out of the surgery and pursue a second opinion or natural treatments. She was discharged on  June 9, 2021 and taken home with medication. She was more alert and lively at home - able to converse and move around with assistance, but did not have strength in her left leg and was losing more strength in her left arm. On June 13, 2021 she suffered a heart attack and was rushed to the emergency room by ambulance. CPR was performed in the ambulance and she was taken to Hospital where they stabilized her but she never regained consciousness. She was taken home for Hospice on June  16, 2021 and passed away on June 19, 2021.

Stroke resulted in weakness and limited mobility on left side and slurred speech. Patient was bedridden following the stroke. Patient had terminal cancer but the stroke following the vaccine seemed to trigger a swift decline and patient died one week later.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

She presented to the ED 3/9 and was found to have a segmental left lower lobe pulmonary embolism (left lateral basilar segment) with associated LLL pulmonary infarction. She had tachycardia to low 110s, mild hypoxia to 89% on room air with no evidence of pneumonia or typical COVID infiltrates. She had no known COVID exposure. She had one prior pulmonary embolism in 1999 treated for 6 months with coumadin, and was subsequently found in 2000 to be heterozygous for Factor V Leiden. She is being admitted to the hospital for treatment of pulmonary embolism.

She takes most of her medicines in the morning and had taken that stuff at about 5 o&#39;clock or so early in the morning. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Feb2021 at the age of 73-year-old and hand no problem. The patient stated that when she had the first COVID vaccination she had no problem and then Friday she went to get the second one, it was 3 weeks later, when she had first one she stated that she had allergies, so they had her wait 15 minutes, no problem. When she went for the second one, thankfully someone drove her that was outside the &#39;game court&#39; location. When they gave it they said, she pull up and will let her know after she pull up and will decide if she has to wait 15 minutes or 30 minutes and they asked her if she had allergies, and she said yes, they said pull over here and she has to wait 30 minutes and all she know was, it&#39;s probably 2 minutes from the time she got the vaccine until she got to the place to wait. She would say 15 minutes after she got it on 26Feb2021, she felt really lousy and told her friend, they &#39;said&#39; she was having a Trans Ischemic Attack (TIA), and took me to the hospital and everything. An ambulance was called on 26Feb2021 at around 8 o&#39;clock that morning, right after she had the vaccine and carried her straight in the hospital. She was discharged the next day 27Feb2021 at about 7 PM. The patient had a CT scan of her brain, MRI of her brain, and then cardial, something with reference to her heart, she forgot, all with unknown results. The body weight right now was about 150 pounds. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, expiry date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 10:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient previously received flu shot from immunization (she had the flu shot 20 years ago had bad reaction to). Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the hospital. The vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient received the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and she felt fine that Friday. On 20Mar2021 (Saturday), she started having a bad headache and took Aleve. She took Aleve 3 times 4 hours apart because she still had a bad headache. She started losing the ability to bring out words. She stated that her headache was gone. On 21Mar2021 (around 4 o clock), her husband was in the kitchen and asked her a question but could not understand her and asked again. She could not say the words but she could spell them. Her husband asked her another question, she tried to talk but she could not answer back. At that point her husband said they were going to the hospital. She was admitted for 3 days from 21Mar2021 to 23Mar2021. The doctor told her she was having a migraine because it had lasted for 2 days. She also spoke with her primary care provider, who looked it up and said this could be a side effect. She was told the migraine may take away the ability to talk. Her headache has been gone but continues to feel very tired (extremely tired since 19Mar2021). Her symptoms came out as if she was having a stroke on an unspecified date. The event &#39;could not understand words but could not answer back&#39; required an emergency room visit.The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CAT scan, MRI, and contrast test, all with negative result on 22Mar2021. The outcome of the event &#39;could understand words but could not answer back&#39; was recovered on 22Mar2021, the event &#39;bad headache/migraine&#39; was recovered on 21Mar2021, not recovered for extremely tired, and unknown for the event &#39;stroke&#39;.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

                                                On March 2nd woke up with right  calf pain.  Thought I had a charley horse in the middle of the night and thought this was the soarness you get afterward. Because I had been on Crestor for approximately 5 weeks I thought that the crestor may be causing muscle pain.  After 2 days of calf pain which was subsiding by then I visited Dr. who ordered a right ultrasound and I had 2 blood clots in the right leg (one in calf and one behind the knee). Due to the fact that I did not meet any standards for getting blood clots I was put on blood thinners (Eliquis) and told to see a hematologist.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25Mar2021, she received the first COVID-19 vaccine and instantly had a pounding headache.  She went to her doctor who said her blood pressure was elevated and was going to do more testing. She and her sister went away thinking she just needed to relax but then had a stroke in the hotel that same day and was in the hospital for 3 days (until 28Mar2021). She has never had high blood pressure and no history of headaches.  The doctor in the hospital thought that this could be related to the vaccine since she had no high blood pressure or headaches before.  She asked the doctors if she should get the second one and they all said they don&#39;t know enough about the vaccine to give her guidance. Outcome of the events were unknown.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

She reported that on the following day, 06Apr2021, her leg was so swollen that she couldn&#39;t put it down. She reported that she went to the emergency room on 06Apr2021 and was found to have an extremely extensive deep vein thrombosis. She reported that she was calling to complete a safety report. She stated that she doesn&#39;t want a deep vein thrombosis to happen to anyone else if her thrombus was from the Covid-19 vaccine. She reported that she and her husband thought they were so lucky as they had no side effects whatsoever following the Covid-19 vaccine doses. She reported that she was not saying that the deep vein thrombosis was from the Covid-19 vaccine but she has never had any blood or clotting problems in her life. Throat hurts: She reported that she thinks that when she was intubated, that whoever intubated her caught her tongue and cut it. She reported that she and her son and husband had been seeing news stories about the (Company name) vaccine. She reported that she has friends that were waiting for the (Company name) vaccine. She reported that her son wanted to send a text message so that others could be aware of the problems they might have. Leg pain: She reported that she went to the dentist on 05Apr2021 and was fine. She reported that when she got home from the dentist, her husband asked if she wanted to the take dog for walk.

She reported that she had 2 surgeries last year, a knee replacement in her left leg and an Achilles tendon repair in her right leg. She reported that when she was released from physical therapy that the therapist told the caller that she might have lymphedema. She reported that the physical therapist directed her to go to a clinic that had no doctor where the clinic staff wanted her to buy a (dollar)10,000 piece of equipment to pump up her legs in the morning and at night. She reported that she came home from the clinic and called the podiatrist that repaired her Achilles tendon. She reported that she went to see the podiatrist that day and that the podiatrist ordered an ultrasound. She reported that a vascular surgeon called her regarding the ultrasound and stated that there was nothing wrong with the veins in her legs. She reported that the surgeon stated that they could tell there was nothing wrong with the her because her feet weren&#39;t swollen and instructed her to follow up in 9 months. She reported that on 05Apr2021, she went back into her house after experiencing the leg pain. She reported that her feet were not swollen and she was not that concerned. She reported that she thought maybe she was just tired and laid down. She reported that when she woke up the next morning, 06Apr2021, that her feet were like balloons. She reported that her son called a friend of his who was an orthopod. She reported that her son&#39;s friend instructed her son to take her to the emergency room, recommending that they bypass a certain hospital. She reported that she went to the emergency room on 06Apr2021. She reported that the emergency room staff did an ultrasound as soon as the caller arrived. She reported that the emergency room staff called the vascular surgeon. She reported that the vascular surgeon stated that if he had been in the caller&#39;s hospital room 5 minutes earlier that the would have done the surgery then, but that he had to lay her on her stomach to perform the surgery and she had eaten some cookies and drank diet soda. She reported that on the following day, 07Apr2021, the vascular surgeon put a scope in her vein and pulled out the clot. She reported that the physician was extremely concerned because the clots were very extensive. Leg pain: She reported that the leg pain was still ongoing. She reported that it hurts when she walks. She reported that she doesn&#39;t know if the leg pain has gotten worse. She reported that her leg pain on 06Apr2021 was excruciating and off the charts. Feet swollen: She reported that the swelling in her feet has maybe gotten slightly better. She reported that her feet were wrapped tightly with ace bandages. Leg swollen like a balloon: She reported that her leg was still swollen but it&#39;s gotten better, maybe about 90%. Extensive deep vein thrombosis: She reported that the deep vein thrombosis was removed on 07Apr2021 from her left leg. She reported that she was at end of her life and she had trips planned. She reported that she had a trip planned recently to go to Las Vegas with her daughter. She reported that her daughter was not able to take the trip, and stated she didn&#39;t know what would have happened if she had experienced the blood clot while in Las Vegas. She reported that she received both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine in her right arm, as she was in the car and her husband was driving. First dose: Date: 21Jan2021; Lot Number: She reported the lot number as EL3047, then stated that the handwriting was hard to read and that the lot number was either EL3247 or EL3047. She stated when reporting on her history that she has no concept of time and was unable to recall exact dates. She reported that while in the emergency room and during admission, the hospital staff did labs, but she has no idea what the results were. Vaccination facility type was drive through clinic at (clinic name). Vaccine administered at military facility: No. The adverse events leg pain, swelling in feet and leg, extensive deep vein thrombosis required a visit to the emergency room. Did not require a visit to the physician&#39;s office. The patient was hospitalized for 6 days for extensive deep vein thrombosis from 06Apr2021 to 12Apr2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan of chest: normal on an unspecified date, ultrasound: there was nothing wrong with the veins in her legs on an unspecified date, ultrasound: unknown results on an unspecified date. The outcome was not recovered for the event leg pain; recovering for the event feet swollen/ leg was like a balloon/ leg started to swell; and unknown for the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported events are assessed as intercurrent medical conditions probably associated to patients underlying conditions and are therefore unlikely related to BNT162B2.

The initial episode lasted approximately 4 hours. These episodes repeated for the next 3 days. She was taken to the Emergency Room by ambulance 3 days after the vaccine and a workup was completed. It was negative at the time of exam. She did have a mild anemia, but CT and laboratory work were otherwise negative. She had recovered strength and her memory. Later that evening she was again unresponsive except to painful stimuli and was like that over night. She was fatigued but was repulsive the next day. She never gained her full strength back. Over the next 4 weeks, she had progressively more of the periods of unresponsiveness and amnesia that stayed progressively longer and recovery was even less in-between the periods of unresponsiveness. She was placed on Hospice Care and succumbed on March 9, 2021, 1 month after her first vaccine.

This 73 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 13Apr2021, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Bell&#39;s Palsy 20 years before the report, shingles in Nov2020, ongoing blood pressure, ongoing cholesterol and ongoing indigestion. Concomitant medications included omeprazole orally, 20 mg, 1x/day (1 capsule every morning), lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide orally, 1 DF, 1x/day (in the morning), for blood pressure and ezetimibe for cholesterol. The patient experienced Bell&#39;s palsy following the first dose, since an unspecified date in 2021. She recovered quickly on an unspecified date in 2021. The event was described as &#34;drool down one side, make sure close eyes at night or they dry out&#34;. The patient was drinking and it was leaking out the side of mouth, smiled and nothing was moving on the right side, right side of face went saggy. It was the right side that was messed up, the right eye didn&#39;t have the muscle coordination that the left eye did. The patient was worried it could be a stroke. She stated she will most likely not receive second dose.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 73-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 73 years old on 16Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included medical diabetes mellitus with mild leukopenia without recurrent infection since 2005, Moderate thrombocytopenia. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient developed a worsening of her ITP, which was clarified as Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura on 23Mar2021. They thought the worsening of this condition was attributed to the vaccine. She was referring to the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The pharmacist made the comment the patient probably had her first dose around 23Feb2021, however, this cannot be confirmed. Pharmacist was unsure of the date when the patient had her first dose. The patient had reported she had a lot of side effects including rash, headache, chills on 23Mar2021. The last lab was done on 26Jan2021 and the patient&#39;s platelet count at that time was 88,000. She had a scheduled routine dental procedure and had a CBC done (in Mar2021) approximately 1 week after receiving the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. When the patient had labs done on 22Mar2021 (after receiving her second dose), her platelet count was at 37,000. The patient&#39;s platelet count stayed low like this after multiple labs were drawn. On 23Mar2021, her platelet count was at 44,000; On 29Mar2021, her platelet count was at 36,000; On 16Apr2021, her platelet count was at 26,000; On 22Apr2021, her platelet count was at 32,000. The patient was started on Dexamethasone 40mg orally for 4 days as treatment for the events. On 26Apr2021, her platelet count bounced back up to 64,000. On 03May2021, the patient&#39;s platelet count was at 125,000. The outcome of event platelet count low was resolving while outcome of other events were unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on chronological connection to the vaccine causality between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to  Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Her nephrologist noted worsening renal function and had her admitted for hemodialysis. Of note, she had not been able to keep her appointment for mAB due to weakness. At the outlying hospital she had a palliative consult and started dialysis. First day of RRT was 4/24/21. Approximately one hour after dialysis she developed 10/10 CP and her EKG changed from a partial LBBB to a complete LBBB. She was transferred to a different Hospital for further evaluation. Her BP was fairly labile and troponins were positive. Approx 7 hours after arrival, she became unresponsive. Heart rate was very irregular in what appeared to be a fib. Transcutaneous pacing was initiated. She was given several amps of bicarb and started on a dopamine infusion. Her daughter arrived shortly thereafter and the pt became apneic. She was transitioned to comfort care and death was pronounced at 04:13 on 4/25/21.

                                                The same day after after receiving the vaccine I noticed while I was doing yard work my leg was swollen, and so I shook it off as if it was nothing. Later on I realized that it didn&#39;t get smaller my leg started to get bigger. So I called  the doctor and they advised me to come in immediately to do an ultrasound. They later on told me that the swelling was  due to a blood clot that formed and they prescribed Xarelto 15 mg 2x day and with that prescription I didn&#39;t see any improvement so they prescribed me to do 20mg 1x day and I&#39;m just now seeing results now.

                                                My only reactions to the shot were a siege of muscle pain throughout my entire body. On March 14th, one week later, I awoke in the night with either afib or a very rapid heartbeat. I have CAD and one stent but have never experienced this.  We drove to clinic. My troponin level was 69 - a count pertaining to heart muscle involvement.  After 7 hours, I was released.  However, two days later, I awoke in the night unable to speak or think clearly. I was taken by ambulance to Hospital where I was diagnosed with a heart attack - the first I&#39;ve ever had.   the troponin level was now 76. Since the heart is a muscle, and the shot affects muscles, could there be a co-relation? I didn&#39;t have the second shot.  Should I have one?

A 73-Year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for Injection, Batch/Lot number: Unknown), via intramuscular route of administration in the left arm, on 04Mar2021 10:45 (at age of 73 years old) as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included cholesterol, thyroid, and multiple sclerosis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication&#39;s included simvastatin for cholesterol. Historical vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on an unknown date in Feb2021(also reported as: When probed for first dose date, consumer stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know exactly, it was about 6 weeks before then, the patient think it was in February, No, maybe it was 4 weeks the patient think that was in February, January, February then we got in March for the second shot.) for COVID-19 immunisation. On 18Mar2021 (Reported as: 2 weeks later), the patient woke up with terrible vertigo and she thought it was vertigo anyways that was what she have throughout the day, She couldn&#39;t see anything really well and she was nauseous, dizzy everything. She spent the day in bed under the coverage so she won&#39;t see anything. it was little bit that night that was she kept down but kind of hard to keep it down, she felt little sick. On next day she woke up and she felt little bit better and she was not quite so nauseous and everything.In Mar 2021, she felt like get up and get around and she was still see like everything was wavy like under water and everything she looked up is like under water was moving, everything and she saw some double vision with effect in Mar 2021. It was reported that she had multiple sclerosis and does not had any problem for over 15 years, she thought that she should take that out from. So, she never expressed it be the muscle stroke was because she never once and all these year of she had it, there had not been excavation acted suddenly, So, she was not convinced that it was her multiple sclerosis but she let it walk for several days about a week later on Wednesday, it was like gone again. So that was fine and then she went to easter and then friday after easter it was started again, and it was really bad and so she was not quite as bad as first day in Mar2021. The patient&#39;s husband took her to the doctor, and the physician could see her eye was jumping her left to right, when she go to left and jump and she could see it was jumping back and forth in Mar2021, she still waited what it could be. So, the physician called the neurologist&#39;s office and they said to go to hospital, they thought she was having a stroke. Then the patient went to the hospital and underwent lots of unspecified tests, and magnetic resonance imaging CAT scan and the patient don&#39;t really know what she really had anyway. The patient&#39;s cholesterol was slightly high in Mar2021. They did find that there was lesion in my spine and neck and my brain from formal excavation of multiple sclerosis in Mar2021. The physician&#39;s checked the patient and confirmed that she doesn&#39;t have stroke and so the physician decided it was her MS, but the patient said it probably, she had her shot two weeks before first problem with this, Now he said, that might be something, now they didn&#39;t say anything to her but that was they going to look like still they have informed her to stay in hospital for 3 days and they give me Intravenous of cortisone so forth and let her out the hospital and sent her the several doctors including the physiotherapist and MS doctor and she spend lot of hours in the doctor&#39;s office. There was a conversation about the COVID stuff, the doctor did not say anything but anyway then had a follow-ups with the doctors with her General Practitioner doctor and said that she should call  and let you know, it was getting improved or was getting better. So she have a movement on her left side little bit, when she move to the left side and things are little bit wavy but anyway it&#39;s getting better but he said she thought it should be reported. The patient stated that other than eye sight no other medical conditions were observed after the second shot. Patient stated that her doctor&#39;s seems to think that you want follow up information from patient to had some kind of reaction and that&#39;s what she was doing to reporting to the Pfizer company that what she had and she was not sure if it was related at all to but she was suspicious because it happened soon after like she said she did not had. It was reported that it did bring some observation, but she did not the same way it usually. So, that&#39;s why she thought she should report all this. The patient did not had any other vaccination prior to covid vaccine. The lab test included computerised tomogram: unspecified and magnetic resonance imaging: unspecified. The outcome of the events vertigo, feeling abnormal and illness recovering, cerebrovascular accident, Nausea, visual impairment, dizziness, Diplopia, Feeling abnormal, eye disorder, vision blurred, blood cholesterol high, Central nervous system lesion was unknown.  Information about batch/ lot number has been requested.

My concern is that this very &#34;healthy&#34; 73 year old, still working despite her COPD currently has a very sudden, very invasive pneumonia post covid vaccines. Her pulmonologist said she was perplexed as to how her CT looked pretty horrible with the patient not showing signs of more severe, chronic build up to what is being seen on the CT. It is concerning that at this point we are not considering the Covid shot as the culprit.

However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

                                                Pt. presented to ED via EMS for emergent coma.  EMS intubated patient in field due to respiratory failure.  Pt. was severely hypertensive with nearly total loss of brainstem reflexes.  Patient had known L MCA cerebral aneurysm with appointment to undergo intervention to address in the near future.  NCCT reported massive multifocal brain hemorrhage, SAH, SDH, and parenchymal hemmorhage with midline shift and subfalcine herniation.  Due to dismal/poor prognosis, family requested withdrawal of support approximately 4 hours after presentation and patient expired shortly thereafter.

Per report, patient had SBP in the 80s on arrival but was asymptomatic. Prior to start of any procedure (no reports of being given sedative medications), she became unresponsive. CPR was initiated and was found to be in asystole. She received 3 rounds of CPR with ROSC. CT head without acute abnormality. Chest XR showing mild vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Initial labs showing AKI, elevated liver enzymes, BNP &gt;29,000, troponin 39, lactic acid of 11, INR of 6.6, PTT 62, APTT 87. UA with protein, nitrite, moderate blood. Urine culture ordered. Blood cultures ordered. In ED, patient was hypotensive requiring addition of vasopressors. Targeted temperature management was started. Ceftriaxone and flagyl started for possible urinary tract infection and aspiration. Patient with profound coagulopathy, INR increasing to 12.0 on arrival to the ICU. Two units FFP and vitamin K were given. Patient with escalating pressor requirements at this time so CT t/a/p was ordered showing multiple bilateral rib fractures, nondisplaced sternal fracture with small anterior mediastinal retrosternal hematoma, small right sided hemothorax, right chest wall hematoma, patchy bilateral airspace disease consistent with atelectasis/infiltrate/aspiration, diffuse GGO consistent with interstitial edema, enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary hypertension, cholelithiasis. FDP elevated and 2 units of cryoprecipitate given 3/16. Hemoglobin decreased to 5.9 3/17 with INR of 5.4. Two additional units of FFP and additional dose of vitamin K ordered. Two units RBCs ordered. CTA thorax and abdomen 3/17 re-confirmed hemothorax and chest wall hematoma but no active bleeding noted. CT bilateral LE showed no evidence of hematoma. Trauma consulted who recommended chest tube placement. Overnight 3/16-3/17, patient also noted to have seizure activity on EEG and patient loaded with Keppra. Head CT 3/17 negative for hemorrhage or other acute processes. Patient remained in status epilepticus 3/17am and additional Keppra load was given and neurology consulted. Received Praxbind for continued bleeding/coagulopathy. 3/17pm went into PEA arrest with 10 minutes of CPR with ROSC. Bronchoscopy following ROSC noted evidence of bleeding from multiple areas, clots removed. MRI brain showing diffuse anoxic brain injury. Propofol stopped 3/19am.   After goals of care discussion this morning, all first degree relatives (daughter and son) all in agreement to transition to comfort care measures. I received call from bedside RN that patient had passed away. On exam, no heart or breath sounds appreciated upon auscultation for 2 minutes. No spontaneous movement or chest rise noted. No pulse palpated for two minutes. Pupils fixed and dilated. No response to noxious stimuli. Time of death 1400 3/20/2021.

A 74-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number unknown), on 20Apr2021 (at the age of 74-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. It was reported that patient was not pregnant. Facility type vaccine was reported as unknown. The patient&#39;s medical history included acute respiratory failure with hypoxia, cardiac arrest, transaminitis, and diabetes. It was unknown if patient had COVID prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if patient received other medications in two weeks and if she received any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (DYAZIDE) both reported as known allergies. It was reported that patient was brought in by emergency medical services (EMS) status post-cardiac arrest. Per EMS she was driving to urgent care (unclear why). She just got her second Pfizer vaccine. At urgent care she collapsed and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was initiated immediately. EMS arrived and her initial rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (PEA). They placed a gel and administered 3 rounds of CPR with 3 onset epinephrine. No shockable rhythm. Patient arrived at hospital intubated and unresponsive on 20Apr2021. Duration of hospitalization was reported as two days. The events were reported as serious with criteria hospitalization and life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if patient was tested for COVID post-vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolving  Information on lot number/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events would seem unlikely related to suspect vaccine BNT162B2, but more likely due to underlying cardiovascular morbidities. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 74-year old contactable female consumer (patient) reported for herself  that she received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Lot No. unknown) at single dose for Covid-19 immunization on 05Feb2021 at 17:30. Relevant history included Shingles when she was 42, Chicken pox.  Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot No. EL3247) at 0.3 ML single dose for Covid-19 immunization on 15Jan2021, experienced Left arm Pain at injection site. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. The patient went to Urgent care and was diagnosed with Shingles on 15Apr2021, which was started with pain in her side, and on 30Apr2021, she was having breathing problems/ breathing was not well at 15:30-16:00. She said shingles were from the  shot. The patient started shrinking before she got the vaccine. It was years before. There was no prescriber. She did not have the pain from the Shingles any longer. The pain was gone for a couple of days now. She had it for 2 1/2 weeks.  She was cooking and the next day, she said she did not feel good, her heart was pounding and breathing was difficult. She went to ER and they did dimer test. They took 12 vials of blood. They told her she had .30 clot. She later stated the Dimer result was 0.30. They did chest x-ray and nothing showed. They looked at her legs too.  That is why they did the sonogram. They wanted her to stay, but he gave her a sonogram of her heart.  It is not enlarged and there is no fluid around it.  She thought he gave referral for outpatient. She has been calling ER for an appointment.  She then found that the doctor was not able to refer to an Echo cardiogram. She needs to go to the one in her home state and she is still in a different state visiting her daughter. She goes home next week and will get it then. She went for stress test Apr 2019 and emailed results  said she had slight mitral regurgitation, so maybe that is where the blood is coming from.   Her sister called and she told her she did not feel well. Breathing problem only lasted a day. She was cooking again and was not doing anything strenuous and felt palpitations in her chest and felt breathing issues again. It is better, but every now and then she gets palpitations. She had a migraine after second dose at 16:00 (unknown date). She went to bed at 4pm and woke up at 1am. She thought she took an Ibuprofen and did not know if it would affect vaccine or not. When she woke up, she was fine.  She had shingles prior. She assumes she must have had COVID and did not know.  he had the antibodies present in May 2020, when she was tested.  When she googled, the people in another country were getting Shingles. She had the chicken pox when she was young. If you get the Chicken pox and the COVID, you are susceptible to shingles.  She does not have any information on those people in other country to report. Her brother and sister both received the Moderna COVID vaccine. Her brother did not have any issues an her sister already reported her issues to them. No further details provided. Separate report completed for her sister.  When looking up an address, she stated she needs a magnifying glass. She needed this before the vaccine. She always has her glasses to read with. ER visited on 15Apr2001 and 01May2021. On 15 They gave her ketorolac and ondansetron, potassium chloride. because her potassium was low. The outcome of event shingles, breathing problems was resolving, the outcome of other events was unknown.     Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about batch/lot number is expected.

A 74-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EI9266, expiry dates was not reported), via unspecified route of administration, on 12Mar2021, as DOSE 2, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperthyroidism, blood pressure high and ongoing asthma, all were from unspecified start date and stop date. Concomitant medications included prednisone, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC) and losartan, all were for unspecified indication. The patient historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EN6206, expiry dates was not reported), via unspecified route of administration, on 12Feb2021, as a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Patient had blood clot, pulmonary embolism that resulted from a DVT in leg, shortness of breath and sinus infection, on an unknown date in Mar2021. Patient stated that, she had blood clot after received the vaccine. Patient got the Pfizer vaccine, first shot on 12Feb2021 and second shot on 12Mar2021 and about two weeks after that patient started getting symptoms shortness of breath and patient was just diagnosed three weeks ago with a pulmonary embolism that resulted from a DVT in leg and they are not sure when that occurred. Patient started with shortness of breath and was an asthmatic, so pulmonologist thought it was the asthma that was acting up then they thought patient had a sinus infection and it just kept getting worse and worse the shortness of breath. Patient stated that, pulmonologist was trying to figure out what could have caused this, they thought it was asthma acting up but apparently shortness of breath kept getting worse and three weeks ago patient was hospitalized and that when they found this large pulmonary embolism and when they did the &#39;legs&#39; they found the clot in the legs and they could not determine the age of it when that occurred, but it would be before patient had the COVID shot. Patient did not receive any other vaccine administered prior COVID-19 vaccine. Patient was hospitalized from 08Jun2021 to 12Jun2021. Patient was clarified the reason of hospitalized as blood clots. Patient was seeing pulmonologist, they did a CAT scan in Feb2021 and that was clear. They also did a cardiac catheterization in Apr2021, thinking that&#39;s why patient was short of breath but that was normal. Patient was in the hospital, they did everything under the &#39;sun&#39;. When patient was in the hospital, they put on a Heparin drip for two days and now on a blood thinner Eliquis. Outcome of the event shortness of breath was not recovered/not resolved and for other events outcome was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information in the case report and a plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal relationship between the events Thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, Deep vein thrombosis, Dyspnoea and Sinusitis and suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On march 20th I have had the first of 5 stomach episodes, severe cramping like labor or menses  cramps, excruciating pain, I broke out into a sweat, vomiting this lasted about an hour. I felt like my heart wasn&#39;t going to make it bc I was in such pain, I had a bowel movement and felt better, then on May 19 I had the exact same stomach attack and I went to doctor and since then I have had 3 more of these attacks. The stomach episodes seem to be getting more frequent. I&#39;m still having swelling in my legs. I still have tightness and pail behind my right ankle. Elevation doesn&#39;t help the swelling. They did find a blood clot in my right leg.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA.   1.5 hours after receiving vaccine (12pm), I felt a flush/warm sensation in my heart area. My heart rate increased, jumping around a lot. I could see my chest moving up &amp; down. I tried to monitor BP &amp; heart rate w/my heart monitor. BP was up to 154/103, pulse 73 at 12:20; BP 150/92, pulse 70 at 1:00pm. My normal pulse is 50-55. Twice the monitor read ERROR.  By 1:30 BP was 128/75, pulse 61 and I felt heart was more calm.  By 10:30pm BP was normal, 116/74, pulse 52. By chance I had appointment with my cardiologist the next day, 1/25/2021. He said it was an episode of atrial fibrillation. I have not had that rapid heart rate issue since the stent implant in December 2011.

It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper forearm on 01Mar2021 at the age of 75-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a pharmacy (in a grocery store). The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient&#39;s medical history included retired (retired registered nurse), ongoing depression (has had this condition for probably 20 years), ongoing lung cancer (has had this condition for probably 3 years), ongoing bipolar (has had this condition for about 4 years), ongoing emphysema (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years), and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years). Concomitant medications included duloxetine taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking this probably for 15 years); and arformoterol tartrate (BROVANA) (started taking this probably 5 years ago), budesonide (started taking this probably 5 years ago), tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) (has been taking this for probably about 4-5 years), oxygen (has been using this full time for 3 years), and Trilogy machine (she sleeps with this, it is an invasive intubation. She puts a big mask on and it pumps air in, pulls air out, letting her lungs rest. Her oxygen hooks up to it), all taken for emphysema and COPD from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported that she received the vaccine on 01Mar2021 and sometime in Apr2021 around Easter, she went to the hospital for COPD exacerbation, tiredness and weakness. The patient required a visit to the emergency room due to the events and reported that she went by ambulance to the hospital. The patient stated that she has these events often and it has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine. She went to the hospital with exacerbation of COPD and missed her date to get her last shot. She wanted to know whether she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine with her experience after the 1st dose. The patient reported that she now weighs 177 after she has been pumped full of cortisone. The patient reported that her lung doctor was really the one that manages her medical. The patient reported that she thinks she came home from the hospital the day before Easter and she was in the hospital for 5 days (in Apr2021). She was sick before that, at home, and she finally had to call # to come and get her. She believes she had to call # the 5th day before Easter, but she was not positive. When asked to clarify what she meant by sick, the patient explained she was extremely tired, she couldn&#39;t get out of bed and couldn&#39;t move. She was having trouble breathing. She was on oxygen 24/7 and sleeps with a trilogy machine so she was having a lot of trouble, it was awful. She said she then found out at the hospital her red blood cell was below 5 and her iron was critically low. They had to give her 2 units of blood and an infusion. Then she went back yesterday and got another infusion and she has to go back next week for another infusion. The patient confirmed that she was hospitalized for COPD. She then stated she didn&#39;t know the exact date of when she was discharged from the hospital, but she was thinking it was the day she was scheduled for her second shot. She then clarified she came home Easter. The patient reported that she can&#39;t do much without having to sit down, catch her breath, and rest a little bit. She was improving but not as fast as she&#39;d like to. While reading the vaccine record card, the patient stated &#34;my eyes aren&#39;t as good as they used to be&#34;. Her pulmonologist stated she was going to die if she doesn&#39;t take the vaccine. If she catches COVID she was not going to make it, so her pulmonologist thinks her chances are better with the vaccine than without it. The patient said she goes all the time to the hospital; therefore, she doesn&#39;t think the events were related to the vaccine. She had been sick several times. They can&#39;t do anything about the bleeding, they can&#39;t go in to do anything because of her lungs, her lungs were so bad. No further details were provided regarding the bleeding she was speaking of. The patient reported that duloxetine doesn&#39;t come as 90 mg so she takes a 30 mg and 60 mg tablet; she mixes the Brovana and Budesoind and takes them at the same time, twice a day. She was given an albuterol solution, 0.5mg PRN (as needed), for her emphysema/COPD. She says she just started taking this from her last hospital stay. The patient reported that she did not remember her iron count, just that it was critically low. She did remember asking the nurse what could happen, and the nurse said a lot of things such as infection. She confirmed tests were done in regards to the lung cancer. Her lungs were too critical for any kind of invasive tests. It was reported that the events Exacerbation of COPD and &#34;extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move&#34; were assessed by the patient as unrelated to BNT162B2. The outcome of the events &#34;Exacerbation of COPD/having trouble breathing&#34; and &#34; extremely tired, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, couldn&#39;t move/tiredness&#34; was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the narrative information provided, the reported events Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Fatigue, Asthenia, Blood iron decreased, Red blood cell count decreased and Asthenia are assessed as intercurrent medical conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 10:45 (at 75 years old, not pregnant), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Type II diabetes, Hypertension, GERD and hypercholesterilymia, sulfa allergy, all from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included verapamil; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR); metformin; omeprazole, unspecified blood thinners. The patient previously took tetracycline for known allergies: Tethracycline. Patient experienced abnormal nose bleed with blood cloths the first day (reported as 30Mar2021 0130). Five days later in two days had 6 more nose bleed that it was taking me to control up to 30 min. She went to ER in the morning and had a CBC having results normal with normal levels of platelets. She was referred to PCP. She saw a NP next day and gave me referral to ENT specialist. Using an scope could not find anything and ordered to have CT Scan. Results show negative for polips, tumors and show only a shadow by eye socket which MD believe it was an infection that was leading to the bleed. Prescribe a very small amount of Amoxicilline 125 mg, twice a day for 7 days plus a saline gel. Patient had the last nose bleed at midnight. For 3 days did not have any bleeding until today, at 10:15 am, with heavy bleeding which took me 15 min. to control. She has no history of nose bleed, taking blood thinners, no head traumas either. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event infection was unknown, other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Information provided was so limited to prevent a meaningful and definite medical assessment for the events.

                                                Heart attack; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 75-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 29Apr2021 at 13:10 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0167, at the age of 75 years) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a pharmacy drug store. Medical history included knee operation on 09Nov2020 and ongoing high blood pressure. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID-19 vaccine.

She described that it felt like she had very severe heartburn. She also became very weak and felt weak all the time. Her doctor called while she felt like she had very severe heartburn. She reports that her physician heard her panting during the phone call and said she was having a heart attack. She took Tums and the severe heartburn went away. It was a small bottle of Tums and she took half of the bottle. By the time she got home she was ok and didn&#39;t believe that she was having a heart attack. One of the physicians came to her home on 29Apr2021. The physician did an EKG and confirmed that she did have a heart attack. The patient stated that she knew the vaccine caused the heart attack and she was not going to get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient stated that she has no medical history or family history of hear attacks. Emergency room visit was not required. The outcome of event heart attack was recovering.
