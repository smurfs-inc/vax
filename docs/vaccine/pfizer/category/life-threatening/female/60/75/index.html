I fell forward and sustained bruising to my right cheek and temple.  I will be reporting another report regarding the second dose with adverse reaction that is the same but required EMS and Emergency Room visit. Approximately 3 hours after injection I was getting ready for bed (as I work nights). I was talking with my daughter and I stood up and remember waking up on the floor. Bruising to the right cheek and temple. I did not seek medical attention and went to bed. I had no further episode but remained dizzy for several days.

                                                61 yo F with history of bilateral lung transplant 6/23/17 presented to ED on 2/4/21 with chief complaint of worsening shortness of breath, nausea and diarrhea for past week since receiving since receiving COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 1/28/21. Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

                                                I am retired handicap-MS.  I was doing light housework.  I started getting pain in right lung,  over course of 2  hours  pain became very severe.  Only in right lung.   Felt like blood clot or pulmonary embolism (which I had 15 yrs ago).  Went to hospital, check X-ray no clot/embolisms.   Blood work showed no clotting factor.    Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

                                                Atrial fibrillation; Was not feeling well; Warm sensation in chest; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot EJ 1685), intramuscular, on 21Dec2020 at 09:30 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine location was left arm.  The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 62-years-old. The patient received also varicella zoster vaccine RGE (CHO) (SHINGRIX) on 19Nov2020. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and high cholesterol. Concomitant medications included omeprazole, colestyramine (QUESTRAN), and vitamins. On 22Dec2020, the patient was not feeling well intermittently starting the day after the injection with warm sensation in chest that would go away until 31Dec2020 when the warm sensation of chest would not go away. The patient was sent for EKG that showed atrial fibrillation that she is now being treated for. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The events were reported as non-serious. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported atrial fibrillation and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2. More information regarding the clinical course, the patient&#39;s underlying concurrent medical condition are required for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

                                                No symptoms after the vaccination on the day of or the day after getting the vaccine.  Two days after the vaccine, while at orthopedist (for a Rotator Cuff Surgery), I began to feel dizzy.  I sat down for a few minutes, drank some water, and then resumed my therapy.  After the first set of my 4th exercises I began to get dizzy, I sat down on the PT table, then laid down and fainted for about 1-2 seconds.  My blood pressure plummeted to 60/?. EMT?s and an ambulance were called.  I was given an IV and taken to hospital.  In the ER, my blood pressure elevated to 205/121. (I think that was it.)  I was given a cat scan, ekg, chest X-ray, blood tests, etc.  All tests were normal except a very slight (by one number)  magnesium level.  I was admitted for observation and more tests where performed.  My blood pressure remained high, but I had no more dizziness or syncope.  I was given many more blood tests, imagining, ultrasound of heart, ultrasound of carotid arteries,  ultrasound ?bubble test,? nuclear heart treadmill stress test.  All tests were normal.  The only change in my health that can be attributed to this episode is the Covid vaccine.

She already has known CAD and risk factors for CVD.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that the vaccine was an indirect cause of the event.  Since the vaccine provoked an immune response, as it was supposed to, it is possible that this inflammation may have set up a metabolic predisposition that may have contributed to the event, which was 12 days later.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EC1284), via an unspecified route of administration administered to left arm/deltoid on 29Dec2020 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a research medical facility; and received warfarin sodium (COUMADIN, strength 2 mg), oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date in 2017 and ongoing at &#34;3 1/2 tablets once daily in the evening at 5:30pm (total 7mg)&#34; for metal heart valve. The patient&#39;s medical history included had the surgery (for her metal heart valve), about 01Mar in 2017 (about 4 years ago) and so she thought she had been on Coumadin for about 4 years, had been on the 7mg dose for over a year; and has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin for the metal heart valve. Denied illness. Denied family medical history relevant to event. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Shingrix vaccine in past and remenbered she had the usual side effects from it, had mild symptoms. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines the same date of the Pfizer Suspect or 4 weeks prior. On Jan2021, the patient experienced scratched arm and bled through 3 shirts, it kept bleeding. On 04Jan2021, her international normalised ratio (INR) was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2). The events did not lead to emergency room visit, however led to physician office visit. The events were reported as serious medically significant. The nurse got the first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 29Dec2020 because she is a healthcare provider. She wanted information on increasing INR. The nurse has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin. Her INR was typically 1.7 to 2.3. She reported her last INR, before the covid-19 vaccine was given, was &#34;some time ago&#34; but it had not varied much over the years. Normally she got her INR run and it was about 2.  She had to be scheduled for her INR on the 04Jan2021 and it was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2) and they asked about anything that may have changed and the only thing was that she got her first shot. The nurse reported not having any changes in her medications, food, or life style to account for the change, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient stated that it could be a serious problem if she had an accident or fell and started bleeding. A normal person&#39;s lab result is between 1 and 2, but they like to keep people with the metal heart valves between 2 and 3. She had been bleeding. She had barely scratched her arm the other day and went through 3 shirts because she kept bleeding. This is more than unusual for her, it&#39;s kind of unusual.  Getting the vaccine is the only variant she has had since getting her last INR. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included INR (normal range 1 to 2): typically 1.7 to 2.3 on an unspecified date; it&#39;s about 2 on an unspecified date: and 5.8 on 04Jan2021. The action taken in response to the events for warfarin sodium was dose not changed. The outcome of the event INR was 5.8 was not recovered, for the other events was unknown. The nurse (patient) assessed the event &#34;INR was 5.8; it&#39;s normally about 2&#34; as related to the COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of International normalised ratio increased and wound hemorrhage due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                Diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome; Deep vein thrombosis; Both of her feet were only slightly swollen; Dull minor headache; Off-label use; Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered; Localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Seizures; throat swelled up; Troponin level increased; Mild heart attack; arm was hurting; breathing issues; Dry heaves; Mucus to come out; Nauseous; Dizzy; Headache; Ears became hypersensitive; Senses heightened; Throwed up; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Died in her sleep after complaining of a headache. I talked to her around 5pm on sunday through a videochat and she seemed happy and well. But a local friend commented that she had complained of a headache late in the afternoon.

In the ED, the patient remained hypertensive with a mild generalized headache. They reported that their eye pain is constant but comes in waves of higher intensity. Differential diagnosis was possible stroke due to right-sided hemianopsia and right-sided ptosis. Patient was admitted and evaluated. Aspirin was administered and blood pressure was monitored prior to discharge.

                                                2 days after vaccination right thighs and right leg started to have pain similar to pain I got with polymyalgia rheumatica that I have had in past and I though it was a flare up. A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

                                                large knot right above the injection site/size of a half dollar/size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot/like egg under the skin or clot; felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore; swelling started almost immediately after the shot/swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area/about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high; thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 67-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot/batch number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in hospital; antilymphocyte immunoglobulins (reported as immunoglobulin infusion, concentrate for solution for infusion, lot/batch number and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dosage for an unspecified indication. Medical history included CVID (Immunodeficiency common variable), Addison Dx (diagnosis) and Pituitary Tumor. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had syncope within 10 minutes of injection on 19Jan2021, episode, BP (blood pressure) 70/40, P (pulse) 40-30, admitted to ICU in Jan2021, determined adverse event maybe 2nd to immunoglobulin infusion received previous day leading to Adrenal Crisis, 2nd to Addison dx / Pituitary tumor which was unknown at time of vaccination. Events were resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient had been hospitalized for 6 days in Jan2021. Since the vaccination, patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The action taken in response to the events for antilymphocyte immunoglobulins was unknown. Therapeutic measures were taken as result of the events syncope, BP 70/40, P 40-30 and Adrenal Crisis. The outcome of the events &#34;syncope, BP 70/40, P 40-30, Adrenal Crisis&#34; was recovered in 2021. Patient then received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 08Feb2021.  Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of antilymphocyte immunoglobulins in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of antilymphocyte immunoglobulins has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the possible contribution of suspect vaccine BNT152B2 and antilymphocyte immunoglobulins to the events syncope, low BP and heart rate, adrenal crisis, cannot be excluded. The underlying Addison disease and Pituitary Tumor are major cofounders for the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

                                                I am writing this on behalf of my mother. She received the first round of the vaccine (Pfizer/EL9269) on 2/18/21. That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

The patient reported having a hot face and neck was flushed, after the vaccine, she stated she had tingling in her tongue, lips, and face. And she stated her throat felt tight also, her lips were puffy, and a lot of heat of neck and face, thought she was starting to shake. The patient reported the pharmacist gave EpiPen in thigh and 20 mg tablet of Benadryl and called 911, and took her to the local hospital. Patient also reported that she has not seen this doctor yet she asked to see her and has an appointment with her. The patient also stated that her new PCP was not aware of the reaction to the vaccine at this time. The patient further mentioned that she was still having a rash that broke out. She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips. Patient continues to clarify she still has swelling and some tingling on the tip of tongue and half back on her tongue. She stated that the swelling was persisting and that Benadryl or Prednisone does give some relief but it comes back. Patient mentioned being on a 4 day cycle of Prednisone, takes two in the morning with food. The patient clarified the location of the rash as a rash on both arms that was inside of both of the arms, like a pink rash, she states it was on face and on knees around the front and back of her knees like a red rash. She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets.

She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store.

She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

A 70-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 27Feb2021 12:00 (lot number: EN6202; expiration date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and stroke from 2012 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN) taken for stroke from 2012 and ongoing; clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDA) and simvastatin both taken for high blood pressure from 2012 and ongoing; ongoing amlodipine, lisinopril, and metoprolol all taken for high blood pressure. On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing. The patient added that she can&#39;t see as good, her eyes are weak. She was going to make an appointment to get her eyes checked. For dizziness event, she has to sit on the side of her bed for 10 minutes and she was still dizzy. She has to hold on to something because she feels like she is going to fall. She was given meclizine three times a day for this event. For tiredness event, she stated that it fluctuates during day. After she takes a paracetamol (EXTRA STRENGTH TYLENOL) and lays down for a while, she feels ok and then she feels tired again. For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal. Outcome of the injection site pain was recovered on 01Mar2021, of the difficulty breathing was recovering, of the headache, chills, fever, dizziness, weakness, and felt sick was not recovered, while of the remaining events was unknown.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were provided. On 22Jan2021, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction. She went to the doctor and he was reluctant to give her steroids which was the normal way of treating the anaphylactic reactions because he said that the steroid would interfere with the effect of the vaccine. So, he gave her diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She had to go back to the emergency room later that day and they used epinephrine (EPIPEN) and she had to have an intravenous (IV) and other than that some medications, it had prednisolone in it. Then she had to go back yesterday and she had another IV and they sent her home with an EPIPEN. The event was assessed serious as medically significant. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021040024) on 18Jan2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 19Jan2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (Hashimotos&#39; Disease), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease) and HAEMORRHAGE (she has a bleeding disorder/ a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding) in 72-year-old female patient who received apixaban (ELIQUIS) for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included COVID-19 VACCINE for an unknown indication. On an unknown date, the patient started ELIQUIS (unknown route) and COVID-19 VACCINE (Intramuscular). On an unknown date, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (seriousness criterion medically significant), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (seriousness criterion medically significant), HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant), CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY (allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes) and DERMATITIS CONTACT (allergies to adhesive, and polymers). The action taken with ELIQUIS (Unknown) was unknown. At the time of the report, AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS, MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, HAEMORRHAGE, CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY and DERMATITIS CONTACT outcome was unknown. Consumer reported that she had read the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and have some questions to the &#34;What should you mention to your vaccination provider&#34;. Caller mentioned that she has allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes, adhesive, and polymers such as the angio-seal that was used on her for a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding. She has irritation from the polymer and described it as a sponge that was meant to be absorbed for a month. Her first question was does the COVID-19 vaccine contain latex, mold (polymers) and adhesive? Response: For latex. For mold (polymer) and adhesive: &#34;A review of the ingredients list on the product label show that mold (polymer) and adhesive are not part of the formulation, however, Pfizer does not specifically manufacture the vaccine to be free of mold (polymer) and adhesive, therefore, we cannot assure that it was &#34;mold (polymer)-free and adhesive free&#34;. We cannot guarantee that minute amounts of substances are not contained in raw materials obtained from our suppliers. She had the PPSD23/Pneumonia 23 vaccine last 05Jan2021 and was told not to get the COVID-19 vaccine for 14 days. Is it because of the injection site or is it for systemic reasons? Consumer mentioned that she was on ELIQUIS. She has Hashimoto&#39;s Disease and Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease. She said that she was not immunocompromised. She mentioned that she has a bleeding disorder. The Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can only be administered as an intramuscular injection For ELIQUIS (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Reporter&#39;s causality assessment was not provided.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Causality assessment for ELIQUIS: Events: Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Contrast media allergy, Topical adhesive allergy, Mixed connective tissue disease were considered unrelated while bleeding was considered related.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had autoimmune thyroiditis, mixed connective tissue disease and hemorrhage after receiving apixaban therapy. This patient also had COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the anticoagulant action of apixaban, its role in the event hemorrhage is considered as possible. Based on the etiology of the reported events, auto immune thyroiditis and mixed connective tissue disorder are considered not related to apixaban.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

Did a telemed appointment with her physician who told her to take one dose of the Epi-Pen, Benadryl, Prednisone, Ventolin, and Singulair.  These medications have worn off, and wants her to take even more doses of the Prednisone, Benadryl and the inhaler.  She is still having symptoms, but improving.  She does not itch as badly.  Her arm is sore.

She presented to the ED 3/9 and was found to have a segmental left lower lobe pulmonary embolism (left lateral basilar segment) with associated LLL pulmonary infarction. She had tachycardia to low 110s, mild hypoxia to 89% on room air with no evidence of pneumonia or typical COVID infiltrates. She had no known COVID exposure. She had one prior pulmonary embolism in 1999 treated for 6 months with coumadin, and was subsequently found in 2000 to be heterozygous for Factor V Leiden. She is being admitted to the hospital for treatment of pulmonary embolism.

                                                My mom only had site soreness after her covid vaccine on 1/21 which resolved within a couple days. However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

Per report, patient had SBP in the 80s on arrival but was asymptomatic. Prior to start of any procedure (no reports of being given sedative medications), she became unresponsive. CPR was initiated and was found to be in asystole. She received 3 rounds of CPR with ROSC. CT head without acute abnormality. Chest XR showing mild vascular congestion and interstitial edema. Initial labs showing AKI, elevated liver enzymes, BNP &gt;29,000, troponin 39, lactic acid of 11, INR of 6.6, PTT 62, APTT 87. UA with protein, nitrite, moderate blood. Urine culture ordered. Blood cultures ordered. In ED, patient was hypotensive requiring addition of vasopressors. Targeted temperature management was started. Ceftriaxone and flagyl started for possible urinary tract infection and aspiration. Patient with profound coagulopathy, INR increasing to 12.0 on arrival to the ICU. Two units FFP and vitamin K were given. Patient with escalating pressor requirements at this time so CT t/a/p was ordered showing multiple bilateral rib fractures, nondisplaced sternal fracture with small anterior mediastinal retrosternal hematoma, small right sided hemothorax, right chest wall hematoma, patchy bilateral airspace disease consistent with atelectasis/infiltrate/aspiration, diffuse GGO consistent with interstitial edema, enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary hypertension, cholelithiasis. FDP elevated and 2 units of cryoprecipitate given 3/16. Hemoglobin decreased to 5.9 3/17 with INR of 5.4. Two additional units of FFP and additional dose of vitamin K ordered. Two units RBCs ordered. CTA thorax and abdomen 3/17 re-confirmed hemothorax and chest wall hematoma but no active bleeding noted. CT bilateral LE showed no evidence of hematoma. Trauma consulted who recommended chest tube placement. Overnight 3/16-3/17, patient also noted to have seizure activity on EEG and patient loaded with Keppra. Head CT 3/17 negative for hemorrhage or other acute processes. Patient remained in status epilepticus 3/17am and additional Keppra load was given and neurology consulted. Received Praxbind for continued bleeding/coagulopathy. 3/17pm went into PEA arrest with 10 minutes of CPR with ROSC. Bronchoscopy following ROSC noted evidence of bleeding from multiple areas, clots removed. MRI brain showing diffuse anoxic brain injury. Propofol stopped 3/19am.   After goals of care discussion this morning, all first degree relatives (daughter and son) all in agreement to transition to comfort care measures. I received call from bedside RN that patient had passed away. On exam, no heart or breath sounds appreciated upon auscultation for 2 minutes. No spontaneous movement or chest rise noted.

Sister was very upset and I was uncomfortable asking more questions. She will call me with more information at a later time. She did say that the hospital staff was not sure of what caused her collapse.

It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.
