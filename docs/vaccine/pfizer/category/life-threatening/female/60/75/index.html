After dinner, around 7:30pm I noticed that my lips were swollen and the rash was spreading. Took one Benadryl and waited 1 hour. Condition worsened so left for ER around 8:45pm. Once there, I was diagnosed with an anaphylatic reaction. I was given Prednisone, Pepcid and Benadryl intervaneously. The Benadryl injection caused my throat to close for a few seconds. Things calmed down so we waited an hour to see if I was responding. There was not a lot of improvement so ER doctor decided to use Epinephrine (EP pen injection). After 2 hours of observation, I was set home to follow up with primary care physcian.

With that, the doctors believed my condition to be related to my 2nd dose, so I was admitted to the hospital. I had to stayed for 2 nights. I am now on blood thinners, other meds (pain medications), and require oxygen during sleep (O2 levels drop too low). I have been referred to lung and hematology specialists. Also, reported that patient experiencing significant shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain under the rib.

I fell forward and sustained bruising to my right cheek and temple.  I will be reporting another report regarding the second dose with adverse reaction that is the same but required EMS and Emergency Room visit. Approximately 3 hours after injection I was getting ready for bed (as I work nights). I was talking with my daughter and I stood up and remember waking up on the floor. Bruising to the right cheek and temple. I did not seek medical attention and went to bed. I had no further episode but remained dizzy for several days.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

Was admitted 4 days.  We treated possibility of MS reaction (solu-methyl) as well as heparin in event of unknown clotting issue.    Here?s why this is strange:   If this was MS flare/relapse, I would have muscle lockup, drop foot, sight issues, sever balance issues  ...(i always have sight issues)..   with this even it was only severe lung pain.     Did not appear to be MS driven issue.  Being educated ?high analytic person,  in reflection,  My ms is very territorial,  it fights anesthesia,  colds/flus/covid when my husband had it.   My MS gets cranky when my immune system is attacked.    I suspect the second covid injection was doing its thing,  dna modification, and I had some lung inflammation and my MS compounded the reaction with crippling issue.  I was in hospital 4 days, IV fluids, heparin, and steriod IV.    Within first 36 hours the extreme lung pain disappeared and I got better.  I do have cats scan, mri, X-rays from stay.  Cat scan clear, X-ray, normal,  mri-classic ms history.  Was this Ms event?  I?m not sold as I didn?t have other normal MS flare symptoms.   Was this injection aggreviated?  Perhaps...  I?m sharing this because I think tracking auto immune disease people is important data gathering.  Feel free to call if more dialogue is necessary

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  Patient presents 3/23/21 for medical monitoring of syncopal episode s/p COVID - 19 vaccine # 2.  Lowered to the floor by vaccine staff.  Patient reports symptoms of weakness, other wise states she &#34;&#34;feels fine&#34;&#34;. Two additional syncopal episodes witnessed by myself when patient attempts to change position.  Past medical history is significant for mild persistent allergic asthma, pre-diabetes, OSA, obesity and BPPV.  Patient reports history of same reaction s/p previous vaccine.  At a approximately 0837 patient was noted to have a worsening rash present to her face.  EpiPen administered via left lateral thigh at 0838.  EMS called to transport patient the ED for further evaluation.    Treatment administered: epipen (lot 0FM406, exp 02/22) left lateral thigh at 0838.    Upon arrival to the ED, patient&#39;s temperature is 98.8° F, heart rate 92-103, respiratory rate 30, saturating 99% on room air with blood pressure 164/91.  The patient&#39;s laboratory studies were largely unremarkable.  While in the ED, the nurse was getting ready to get the patient up to the commode when the patient started to &#34;&#34;not feel right again.&#34;&#34;  She asked her to administer the medications for allergic reaction and reports wall the 2nd medication was being infused, she felt paralyzed and unable to talk, although she was able to hear everything and was aware, she was unable to move or speak for a short amount of time.  CT head with completed at this time and showed no acute intracranial findings.  Chest x-ray unremarkable.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia, heart rate 80 and prolonged QT at 470.  The patient was administered Solu-Medrol 125 mg IV, Pepcid 20 mg IV, Benadryl 50 mg IV, normal saline 1 L IV.  Pt was admitted to hospital for observation.    The patient was seen on the unit laying in bed with her husband at the bedside.  She reports that she is feeling slightly better and hungry and has never felt at paralyzed/unable to speak feeling before and is very nervous about this.  She was wondering if she had a seizure, although she reports feeling aware the entire time and did not lose bowel or bladder function. We discussed that that is not typical for a seizure, but even if we did an EEG at this time, it would not be able to tell us what occurred in the past.  We discussed continue the Benadryl, Pepcid, and IV steroids for today and likely decreasing them tomorrow. We discussed the workup of syncopal episodes as well. The patient and her husband were agreeable to this plan.    Patient was discharged from the hospital on 03/24/2021 in a stable medical condition.  Patient was instructed to follow-up with her PCP in 1 week.

                                                AFib; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A non-pregnant 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 15Mar2021 at 14:00 (02:00 PM), at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination. No other vaccine was administered in four weeks. One week after the vaccine on 22Mar2021 at 09:00 AM, the patient had an atrial fibrillation (Afib) event. On 22Mar2021, the patient went to the emergency room (ER) or department or urgent care and ran tests including electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, and blood work which were all normal. Now, the patient had to go to a cardiologist for further understanding of the reason for AFib event. No treatment was given for the event. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination. The patient was recovering from the event.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

                                                I experienced a slight headache  sore arm and elevated blood pressure after the shot. My blood pressure is usually very well controlled. On Monday the 29th, at about 3:30 pm, I started to slur my words. At first we blamed it on the Novocaiine earlier in the day, but I had been talking fine after it and had had it many, many times before and it was worn off. We called my doctor&#39;s office after my right arm and leg became very heavy and awkward. They told me to go to the nearest hospital. When I got there, I presented ass a full stroke. I was very hard to understand and my mouth drooped and I had very little use of my right arm and leg. They ran tests, but could not give me the medication because I was already on Eliquis. They thought they saw a small clot very high up. I was hospitalized over the next four days and improved my speech dramatically after a bad headache on March 30. The doctors go back and forth to whether it was a Acute Ischemic Stroke, which is what my paperwork says and a complex migraine. I do not experience migraines or anything like this ever before.  I did not have a real headache on the 29th. Since my symptoms, right arm and leg difficulties are still here, my Doctor believes it was a stroke. I have an appointment with a Neurologist and I have to have another MRI. I am going to Physical Therapy. My Doctor told me to fill this out, she thinks it may be from the vaccine.

It was reported that 09Apr2021- got her 1st Pfizer COVID shot. Left arm. Felt okay afterward, got a little tired later on. On Sunday, she woke up w/an earache on her left side, which moved down into her neck - near her lymph nodes. Later, her neck started swelling/itching/stinging/feeling warm, and it hurt her throat to swallow anything. She went to get Benadryl and anti-itch creams, but they didn&#39;t work. The neck itching/burning and throat/ear pain got worse, and at one point it felt like her throat was swelling and getting narrow, and she wondered if this was one of those anaphylactic reactions. So she took 2 Benadryl, and that seemed to help. That night she couldn&#39;t sleep for the neck heat, itching and throat pain. Monday AM (12Apr2021), she took her temp, which was 100.2. She did a Teladoc Zoom so the doc could see the situation, and he said that it could be a severe vaccine reaction, or some kind of infection. He prescribed prednisone &amp; clindimycin. The rash left scars, which are peeling. Ae resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Prescription drugs. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Two days after the vaccine, while at orthopedist (for a Rotator Cuff Surgery), I began to feel dizzy.  I sat down for a few minutes, drank some water, and then resumed my therapy.  After the first set of my 4th exercises I began to get dizzy, I sat down on the PT table, then laid down and fainted for about 1-2 seconds.  My blood pressure plummeted to 60/?. EMT?s and an ambulance were called.  I was given an IV and taken to hospital.  In the ER, my blood pressure elevated to 205/121. (I think that was it.)  I was given a cat scan, ekg, chest X-ray, blood tests, etc.  All tests were normal except a very slight (by one number)  magnesium level.  I was admitted for observation and more tests where performed.  My blood pressure remained high, but I had no more dizziness or syncope.  I was given many more blood tests, imagining, ultrasound of heart, ultrasound of carotid arteries,  ultrasound ?bubble test,? nuclear heart treadmill stress test.  All tests were normal.  The only change in my health that can be attributed to this episode is the Covid vaccine.

A 62-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (brand=Pfizer-BioNTech, lot unknown=true, lot unknown reason=unable to locate or read the details) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 26Mar2021 11:45 (62-year-old at vaccination date) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a bruit, ventricularomegaly, gastrointestinal (GI) issues, many female issues (before she got a hysterectomy), cancer activity, hepatitis C (Hep C), COVID-19 since 18Mar2021 (diagnosed as extremely positive, remained sick until 25Mar2021), and allergies to medications, food, or other products included Motion sickness meds. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination was reported as yes but unspecified. About 25 minutes after the vaccine, her throat area under her jaw line started to hurt, her left leg was achy and tingly, and she was started to get a bad headache. She became nauseated and weak. She made it home, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), and got in bed. Saturday her headache was on steroids, she had fever, and just didn&#39;t feel good. Later that day, she was so sick she went to the bathroom and she guessed she passed out. Basically, her husband said he found her on the floor after he heard a thump. He asked me what was his name. He said she responded correctly, but then her eyes rolled back, she became rigid, and he called 911. she knew 2 sets of paramedics arrived w/ambulances. They monitored her vitals and stayed until she was normal. They were willing to take her to the hospital, but offered other options for her husband and she to consider. They suggested she see her Primary care doctor (she did on 29Mar2021). Her doctor believed she should not take the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Adverse event start date was 26Mar2021 at 12:30 pm. AE resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. It was reported no treatment received for the adverse event. The outcome of event was resolving. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                She got the vaccine on Dec 23, and then on Jan 4 she had a mild stroke with left sided arm and face weakness.  She did recover fully.  She already has known CAD and risk factors for CVD.  It is possible, but by no means certain, that the vaccine was an indirect cause of the event.  Since the vaccine provoked an immune response, as it was supposed to, it is possible that this inflammation may have set up a metabolic predisposition that may have contributed to the event, which was 12 days later.

A 63-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot and expiry not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anaphylactic reaction (broad), neuroleptic malignant syndrome (broad), anticholinergic syndrome (broad), acute central respiratory depression (broad), hypersensitivity (broad), respiratory failure (narrow), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (broad), hypoglycaemia (broad), COVID-19 (broad) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium and lorazepam (ATIVAN). Within 24 hours of receiving the vaccine, the patient experienced fever, respiratory distress, and anxiety developed requiring oxygen, morphine and lorazepam (ATIVAN). The patient passed away on the evening of 26Dec2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 antibody test: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event death was fatal, while of the other events was unknown. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

A 63-year-old female patient (mom) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration in arm in Feb2021 (reported as in the first week of Feb2021) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 in Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Reporter (patient&#39;s son) received his first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday and wanted to know if this vaccine could cause blood clot. He stated his mom (patient) in the hospital due to pulmonary embolism from 24Feb2021, 2.5 weeks after her second shot. He stated his anxiety levels were higher than normal. He had strong response to flu vaccine this year and experienced chill, shakes, fever, received antibiotic, and loss sense of taste from the flu vaccine. Reporter read online that some people commented that they have DVTs (deep vein thrombosis) and blood clots from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Patient experienced blood clots in the lung in Feb2021 and hospitalized on 24Feb2021. Patient got her second shot about 2 weeks before and she ended up in the hospital with pulmonary embolism. They looked at her lungs and found all the blood clots. Patient had really bad shortness of breath, headache, her jaw hurt, and her shin hurt. She was helping out at vaccine clinic and she was out of breath, she said the old people in strollers were passing her. Patient began to make complaints about how she was feeling in mid of Feb2021. Patient said in rare cases 2 weeks after the second dose reactions could happen. Patient got done working in ICU, and helped with PPE, then at 11 she left work at the hospital, she was experiencing heart burn for 3 days and so she thought had a heart attack drove to an ER (emergency room) on the way home, and then was admitted to the hospital on that same day 24Feb2021, she was supposed to be discharged today (26Feb2021). Patient had been feeling out of breath for past 2 month, it was possible it might seem like it was related to the vaccine but it could also not be related. Reporter stated that on the internet he saw how a 1000 deaths happened after the vaccine, it was all old people, but in the autopsies there was no link to the vaccine, they were going to die regardless. Lab data included: She did get a test before for Factor 5 Leiden but it was negative. They did test for COVID, it was negative, while in the hospital. In the hospital they were also testing her again for the Factor 5 Leiden, the results hadn&#39;t come back yet. They did test for blood clots, they did an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in Feb2021, it was positive for blood clots (blood clots in the lungs). When she was admitted her oxygen was 85%. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot and batch number has been requested.

When she got to the ER- they had to use the old blood pressure cuff to get her blood pressure because it wasn&#39;t coming up on the machine- the kind where you pump it up and watch the needle, they said it was 58/38. patient states that they asked her about the rash that was all over her body in 2021; caller reports that she did not have a rash when she called at 4 PM. patient describes the rash as an extremely red sunburn rash- like you got really bad sunburn, most of it was on her torso, she also had it on legs on 13Mar2021. patient mentioned she remembers them taking off sock and her toes were purple on 13Mar2021. She also had a red on her eyelids- she described as itchy and swollen on 13Mar2021. patient mentions that unbelievably as sick as she was in 2021, she could understand everything that they were telling her. Treatment was given as they prescribed her Prednisone and Benadryl; she was also hooked up to an IV, and they were trying to warm up her body because body temperature was low in 2021. Discharge paper reads as anaphylaxis due to vaccination on 13Mar2021. patient states that she came home from hospital on Monday, 15Mar2021. patient reports she started a diet. 2nd day (12Mar2021)- From the time she got up, she was too cold to do anything; she couldn&#39;t walk and she was feeling like she was getting the flu. Saturday (13Mar2021)- She woke up and had the worst Charlie horse between ankle and calf- took forever to walk Charlie horse off. Really sharp Charlie horse. Even had less energy today. Really nauseated. patient reports that yesterday and today, she is just tired. She doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s just her body catching up on sleep or she&#39;s just tired; she will find out today when she goes to doctor. Caller mentions that she is normally more active than she feels right now. patient reports her eyes have been itchy and she has a rash on her eyelids. patient doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s from the shot; patient mentions that she decided on 01Mar2021 she would start a diet, get healthy, and see a nutritionist. patient reports that initially she didn&#39;t think her symptoms were from the vaccine and thought it was that she wasn&#39;t eating enough food on Friday. She got in touch with the dietitian. patient reiterated she did not attribute this to shot right away. patient reports that she was wondering if she had asymptomatic covid, and it would have been within a 3-month period that she reacted to the shot. She was not sick if she did have asymptomatic covid. There still trying to figure out why her body had this reaction. patient states that every now and then she was still cold, but she doesn&#39;t know if its her imagination and plus it is cold outside where she is. She is still on the cuff on that one. patient describes the nausea she first felt as almost felt like morning sickness on 12Mar2021-that&#39;s why she attributed it to her diet. patient mentions that the day she started feeling better, late Sunday afternoon, she wanted salty foods. Anything salty, chips, she just really wanted salty stuff. She was not normally a salt person, but the saltier it was, the better it was. patient reports that when she was vomiting with diarrhea and laying down, she would be throwing up in a towel because she couldn&#39;t make it to the bathroom when she was laying, it would just gush. patient describes it felt like her body was going to be locked into the position it was in, she doesn&#39;t know how to describe it. patient states that she had vomit on her clothes when she called. patient reports the nausea stopped late Monday and the queasy feeling went away. patient reports she stopped vomiting when they gave her Zofran- they had to give her a couple because she didn&#39;t stop throwing up right away. patient reports she was extremely dehydrated and her kidneys were showing some damage; her creatinine level was really off on 13Mar2021. The diarrhea was gone, but now she has a mixture of soft stools and semi formed. It is trying to improve but hasn&#39;t yet. patient states that because of her creatinine level, they did want her to drink and she might have soft stools because she was drinking so much. patient reports she knows when her husband put the shirt on her she did not have the rash, but when the ambulance arrived, they said she had the rash. Upon discharge, they told her not to receive any further covid vaccines- she cannot get her second one which was scheduled for 01Apr2021. She started experiencing the really cold feeling on 12Mar2021 after receiving the vaccine. She went to bed at 7, that&#39;s not like her, she was usually up all hours of the night. symptoms she was experiencing were beyond typical. patient reports she also felt dizzy and weak on 13Mar2021. She thought she was going to die because of the purple toes in 2021- she knew that was a sign of her body shutting down and she got the most scared. patient mentions she is experiencing a residual side effect from the covid and influenza tests-both were negative on 13Mar2021, but it seems like her nose won&#39;t stop running ever since she got it, sore from blowing- looks like Rudolph in 2021. patient reports she feels human today, but she is still sleepy in 2021. She thinks she would feel a whole lot better if her nose stopped running. The tiredness might be from nose blowing and stuff. patient remembers the nurse was thrilled that her toes weren&#39;t purple anymore. It started going away when her blood pressure and everything came back up. patient states that she was so scared that she was dying so she remembers everything that happened. patient remembers she was in the ER still when her blood pressure improved. Treatment for her face was so red like the rough sunburn feeling and putting moisturizer on the dried cheeks. patient reports that she doesn&#39;t see any patches of red on her. Part of her has a fear that the stuff is not totally out of her system and it will happen again. patient mentions she has heard comments that this was not a typical reaction from the first one and wants to know if it is typical to be that sick from the first dose. patient reports that now her eyes just feel like she&#39;s allergic to something. She doesn&#39;t know if the redness is from crying now- it was improving, but was still there. Husband has Parkinson&#39;s and Frontal lobe dementia and she is his caregiver, she cannot afford to get Covid, she wants to get back to normal. patient reports that she did not take any of her prescriptions the day of the vaccine, she did not want to get a reaction. patient reports she had her shoulder- torn rotator cuff-operated on in 2018. If nose is really stuffed up or allergies, or Fluticasone nasal spray- she can take it 2 times a day, 2 squirts in each nostril, take it as needed. patient reports that she has the worst sinuses- when it gets too bad, she&#39;ll go to the doctor and she&#39;ll prescribe Flonase, take Metamucil or whatever she thinks will help with sinuses. she still wants to get the second vaccine. patient reports her creatinine came down well enough that she could come home from the hospital, it was still high on 15Mar2021 so they told her to drink lots of water so she does not get dehydrated.

She added she experienced &#34;flu-like symptoms&#34;. She specified these adverse reactions are all gone now but her arm is still &#34;a little sore&#34; and she has one area with a &#34;big circle around it and it&#39;s hard&#34;. She said it could be &#34;swelling&#34;. She asked if her reaction was reported as side effects to the vaccine. She expressed being in a rush and is expecting her daughter soon and asked us to be quick. She said she will also consult with her HCP this afternoon. Patient stated she had the first shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and today and last night the site was red, but today in that area she has gotten a big circle around it and its hard. Patient stated she&#39;s had it before with shots and just wanted to make, sometimes she has had to be put on medicine for it, wanted to be sure its healing because it does hurt her, right in that area where the shot was given. She also stated that after she has her second shot on 12Apr2021, she would like to talk to somebody and she would like to be able to have people in her home. She was reporting she had COVID three weeks ago, would she be ok after the 2nd shot to go out? She stated her daughter thinks she needs to wait until the end of April. She verified she did receive the Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 vaccine. Swelling: Patient stated her arm is swelling. Also stated she always gets that and today there&#39;s a circle there and it is red and hard. Also stated occurred after the shot. Patient reported that the shot hurt like heck and she couldn&#39;t really tell, she has big arms, she knows it was swollen.

Red and a hard circle: She also reporting her entire arm ached after the shot, she stated she knows her entire muscle was aching. Stated it was swollen quite a bit but now its just red and a hard circle, and it&#39;s ongoing.

She stated it does hurt when she bends it because she had that one little area that&#39;s swollen. Also stated the swelling started later that afternoon after the shot. Reported she went for a walk with her daughter and her arm started aching. It felt like she couldn&#39;t go to the bathroom, cramps. It felt like she had a little bit of the flu, and it was from the shot but it only lasted a few days. Stated that part went fast, got a fever, other than that, just the one area on her arm. Stated she doesn&#39;t even feel sick from the shot or anything. Stated she had Diarrhea: Stated she had diarrhea in the beginning after the shot then had trouble going to the bathroom. Stated she thinks its because she has IBS and that&#39;s how her body is. She doesn&#39;t know if that&#39;s from the shot or not because that&#39;s how her body always is. Pfizer BioNtech Covid 19 Vaccine: Patient stated she doesn&#39;t want COVID again. She has respiratory problems anyway, she has asthma and a little bit of obesity. She states she was in fear of herself. She doesn&#39;t do well with hospitals and being put under with that medicine.

About the medical history, non-alcoholic liver disease: Stated diagnosed about eight years ago, she would say the same time, about 7 to 8 years ago because she had a virus and when she went in the hospital, the virus had attacked her right kidney and liver. She stated with non-alcoholic liver disease, she is overweight, and that causes her to have issues with her liver. The last few times her liver has been okay. Pre-Diabetic: They have been watching that for a while. Stated she gets edema, swelling in her legs, well, all the time. She has had this the last two years because she is pre-diabetic and a lot of overweight people have that. She also has varicose veins so that doesn&#39;t help. Stated that was given those to help break up, because she had pneumonia when she got the COVID and she had a little bit of pneumonia and had trouble breathing.

                                                has possible atrial fibrillation; Arm would get hurt; her arm felt like a bruise; irregular heart rates; She&#39;ll have  a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night.; When probing for specific event information she reports it&#39;s kind of like she coughs a little more and she is a little more short of breath and it&#39;s happening more often; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 63-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 63 years, via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 04:06 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma, hysterectomy, dark chocolate or red dye (she starts coughing and has an allergic reaction and shortness of breath), bursitis (in her right). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took penicillin, experienced allergy and had really ad hives (several years ago) she was given a cream to put on. She had to get another medication and she doesn&#39;t remember the name. That medication made her dizzy and she couldn&#39;t even get out of bed so they had to half the dosage. When she had her hysterectomy she learned she couldn&#39;t take any types of &#34;cillins&#34; medications. The patient had been watching her heart rate with a device and since getting the Covid 19 vaccine she&#39;s noticed her heartrate was always higher than it normally is. Her heartrate was going crazy, the device was not recording right. She reports that for the last 2 days the device has been telling her she has possible atrial fibrillation. This is worrying her. She doesn&#39;t feel anything different. She was usually hyper. Her resting heartrate was higher. Normally her resting heartrate was in the 80s (beats per minute) Now it&#39;s going up to the 90s (beats per minute) then her heartrate drops to 40 something (beats per minute) Then the device said her heartrate was 118 and 107 and she&#39;s not even doing anything. She hasn&#39;t even worked out yet. She doesn&#39;t like to take medicine. Medications don&#39;t work out with her. She had a slight cough and she feels a little short of breath then she&#39;s fine. That happened leaving the Covid 19 vaccine site. And it&#39;s been happening more at night. It was reported that she feels fine. She has no other symptoms. She&#39;s been reporting online. Clarified she&#39;s reporting online through the V check through the CDC. She&#39;s been trying to get the Covid 19 vaccine forever. She did research on all the Covid vaccines and she felt more confident with the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter was against the Covid 19 vaccine. Her daughter thinks the vaccine was just going to kill her. She reports she was healthy and she works out 6 days a week.  She recently tried to get a CT scan for her heart. Her husband&#39;s cardiologist recommended her husband have a CT scan of his heart and she decided she needed a CT scan too. She&#39;s also watching her heartrate on her watch. Her husband&#39;s heartrate is completely normal and stable on the device so she knows the device isn&#39;t messed up. It was also reported that the device will tell her she has too much muscle movement and she&#39;s standing completely still. Then she&#39;ll get the device to record her heart rhythm and it goes sporadic. The device tells her 90 beats per minute at resting then over 100 beats per minute. Her heartrate on the device was going up and down a lot. When she&#39;s been watching the device record her heart, it looks like it&#39;s going crazy. Her heartrate goes way up and way down like in the 40s (beats per minute) She noticed when her heartrate is in the 40s (beats per minute) and she&#39;s never had her heartrate go down that far, it&#39;s really really weird. She thinks maybe she&#39;ll get back to normal. She keeps watching hear heartrate. She reports she noticed her heartrate right away on Saturday evening after she received the Covid 19  vaccine. Her heartrate was higher than normal for resting, it was in the 90s (beats per minute). Her resting heartrate is usually in the 60-80s (beats per minute) and it was the in 90s. Now the device says possible atrial fibrillation. It was further reported that she received the Covid 19 vaccine in her left arm because she has bursitis in her right. If she hit her arm the second day after the Covid 19 vaccine, her arm would hurt. Her arm felt better the next day. She clarifies, on Sunday, 28Mar2021, she noticed her arm felt like a bruise and that was it. Then the next day on Monday, 29Mar2021, the feeling was gone. She didn&#39;t have any redness. The outcome of the events her arm felt like a bruise and arm would get hurt was recovered on 29Mar2021, irregular heart rates, dyspnea, cough was not recovered and unknown outcome for has possible atrial fibrillation.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Stroke; MRI showed Pontine Stroke; left arm was weak; her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble/she cannot write or type; arm was sore; she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred; was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4; was not able to walk at first; her arm was cold; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 08:00 (at the age of 63-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included high blood pressure that was diagnosed 2-3 years ago, diabetes; she was prediabetic, heart;cholesterol has been high for about 30 years; since she was in her 30s; all from an unknown date and ongoing. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247) on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. The patient had no prior vaccination in four weeks. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin taken for blood cholesterol and takes 20mg once a day prior to stroke and in the hospital they increased it to 40mg once a day and ongoing; ramipril taken for blood pressure and she was prescribed with this medication for a while prior to her stroke. It was discontinued in the hospital. Stated that she did not take it everyday because she was allergic to it; and sitagliptin (JANUVIA [SITAGLIPTIN]) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and stated that she has been taking for quite a while. On 24Feb2021 she had her second shot. She said that everything was fine that morning; that afternoon her arm was sore. Stated she thought nothing of it. That evening she entertained guest. They were saying she sounded different; they said her speech sounded slurred. She had gotten her vaccine at around 08:00. Again, she didn&#39;t think anything about her speech. On 25Feb2021, she got up and did some laundry going up and down the steps. Stated that it was difficult because her arm was still sore. She cleaned the house. At around 15:30 she was doing bills and noticed that her writing looked like a baby&#39;s scribble. On 26Feb2021, she noticed that her left arm was weak and was told by her doctor to go to the Emergency Room where they told her she had a stroke. She added that it seemed like her arm was cold for a number of weeks. Stated she was the type to wear t-shirts in the winter because she was always hot. During those weeks she was wearing heavy clothes and was under blankets. She was just now starting to feel more like herself and not so cold all the time. The patient was unable to recall time frame when this symptom began. The events did require a visit to emergency room and physician office. The patient was hospitalized for 4 days due to the events from 26Feb2021 to 01Mar2021. During hospitalization, the patient saw a cardiologist, neurologist, her primary care provider, and the hospitalists who all said it was very suspicious that her stroke happened right after her vaccine. Before she got her second vaccine, she was doing embroidery and everything she normally does; nothing was wrong. They did a CAT Scan that showed nothing. Then the MRI of the brain showed a Pontine Stroke on 26Feb2021. Cardiologist put a heart monitor on her and could not find anything. They were looking for A-Fib or something like that when she was on the heart monitor in the hospital; but it never showed anything irregular. She had a loop recorder implanted to monitor her heart and they haven&#39;t found anything wrong on it. She had heart tests, carotid artery tests, ultrasound of her heart and nothing was found on those tests. They pretty much told her in the hospital that they couldn&#39;t find a reason for her stroke. She kept asking about the vaccine. They did not rule it out as a cause, but they also did not say it was the cause. All the doctors said they could not pin her stroke on the vaccine. They stated it was suspicious and that they had seen 2-3 other patients with a similar situation. One of the doctor&#39;s told her he would not rule it out. They did an ultrasound of her carotids and heart and did not find anything on those tests that would have caused her stroke. She was having lasting effects related to her stroke. Her arm was still sore at times, stated it was a different kind of sore and could be related to all the therapy she does now. The lingering effects after stroke was reported as she was not able to walk at first. She&#39;s been doing therapy focused on her left side. Stated that her left side was the dominant side and she cannot write or type. She couldn&#39;t do the report online due to the difficulty with typing. She wanted to make sure this was reported. The patient has been doing therapy for 7 weeks, twice a day; and stated she likely still has months more of therapy to try and get her left side back to normal. She said that simple daily duties are difficult. The patient also stated that she was prediabetic before her hospitalization with her number (A1c) usually being 6.5-6.8. She added that when she was in the hospital it was 7.4. She doesn&#39;t know what made it go up. Then states she doesn&#39;t know if the vaccine made it go up or not. She has a follow up with the neurologist soon. The patient also reported medications she has been taking since her stroke and hospitalization; but not prior to her vaccine which included Amlodipine-Benazepril:  5-20mg once a day and Aspirin: 325mg once a day. The patient stated that stroke and heart problems do not run in her family. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EC1284), via an unspecified route of administration administered to left arm/deltoid on 29Dec2020 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a research medical facility; and received warfarin sodium (COUMADIN, strength 2 mg), oral (by mouth) from an unspecified date in 2017 and ongoing at &#34;3 1/2 tablets once daily in the evening at 5:30pm (total 7mg)&#34; for metal heart valve. The patient&#39;s medical history included had the surgery (for her metal heart valve), about 01Mar in 2017 (about 4 years ago) and so she thought she had been on Coumadin for about 4 years, had been on the 7mg dose for over a year; and has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin for the metal heart valve. Denied illness. Denied family medical history relevant to event. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Shingrix vaccine in past and remenbered she had the usual side effects from it, had mild symptoms. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines the same date of the Pfizer Suspect or 4 weeks prior. On Jan2021, the patient experienced scratched arm and bled through 3 shirts, it kept bleeding. On 04Jan2021, her international normalised ratio (INR) was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2). The events did not lead to emergency room visit, however led to physician office visit. The events were reported as serious medically significant. The nurse got the first Pfizer COVID-19 shot on 29Dec2020 because she is a healthcare provider. She wanted information on increasing INR. The nurse has a history of metal heart valve and takes Coumadin. Her INR was typically 1.7 to 2.3. She reported her last INR, before the covid-19 vaccine was given, was &#34;some time ago&#34; but it had not varied much over the years. Normally she got her INR run and it was about 2.  She had to be scheduled for her INR on the 04Jan2021 and it was 5.8 (normal range 1 to 2) and they asked about anything that may have changed and the only thing was that she got her first shot. The nurse reported not having any changes in her medications, food, or life style to account for the change, other than receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient stated that it could be a serious problem if she had an accident or fell and started bleeding. A normal person&#39;s lab result is between 1 and 2, but they like to keep people with the metal heart valves between 2 and 3. She had been bleeding. She had barely scratched her arm the other day and went through 3 shirts because she kept bleeding. This is more than unusual for her, it&#39;s kind of unusual.  Getting the vaccine is the only variant she has had since getting her last INR. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included INR (normal range 1 to 2): typically 1.7 to 2.3 on an unspecified date; it&#39;s about 2 on an unspecified date: and 5.8 on 04Jan2021. The action taken in response to the events for warfarin sodium was dose not changed. The outcome of the event INR was 5.8 was not recovered, for the other events was unknown. The nurse (patient) assessed the event &#34;INR was 5.8; it&#39;s normally about 2&#34; as related to the COVID-19 vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of International normalised ratio increased and wound hemorrhage due to temporal relationship.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                COVID- 19 Vaccine. She was experiencing chest tightness, SOB, and dizziness. 50mg of Benadryl and 20mg of famotidine was administered around 1410. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3mg of epinephrine was administered at 1420. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse ox 100%, HR 68, BP 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care.  Pt seen in Emergency Room 1/16/2021 1513 CHIEF COMPLAINT: reaction to COVID vaccine   HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Patient is a 64y F with PMHx significant for Myopericarditis, Anxiety and HTN who presents to ER after developing tongue swelling, wheezing, tunneled vision and shortness of breath. Patient states that she was getting first shot of COVID19 Pfizer vaccine at 2:00 pm. After getting vaccine she waited 15 minutes like she was told and recalls room getting very hot at approximately 6 minutes after getting vaccine. She also states that her tongue felt swollen. She then noticed her vision started to turn dark and then she felt dizzy. She told pharmacist about symptoms and then she was given one pill of Benadryl. This did not help and actually made her symptoms worse. She recalls wheezing. She was given another pill of what she believes was Benadryl. She also recalls pharmacist measured her BP and her husband, who was present, reported that her blood pressure was in the 140s This did not improve so she was given 0.3mg IM epinephrine shot. This significantly improved her symptoms. However, she was sent to ER.  She denies any hx of recent UTI or GI infection. She denies fevers, chills, nausea, diarrhea, chest pain, generalized itching, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized swelling, headache or syncopal episode. She denies any past reactions to vaccines. She denies current SOB and feels like her symptoms resolved. Denies hx of COPD or asthma. Physical exam did not show any recurrent signs of wheezing or tongue edema. Her SaO2 was 100% on RA and BP was within baseline 140-160s. Given episode, we decided to obtain tryptase levels. We also observe patient to ensure she did not have any recurrence of symptoms. She remained hemodynamically stable and SaO2 remained in mid 90s to 100. She was given a rx for epinephrine pen should symptoms recur though this is highly unlikely as she remained stable throughout ER stay. She was also given instructions to pick up OTC Benadryl and Pepcid. She does have antihistamines listed as an allergy but patient states that she gets tachycardic upon taking tabs, so this could just be a side effect. We will follow up with tryptase levels but even if tryptase levels return as normal, it does not mean she did not have an anaphylactic reaction to vaccine. Her clinical picture puts this diagnosis high in the differential. Teaching and instructions were given to patient and her husband. She was advised to return to ER if symptoms recur.    IMPRESSION: Anaphylaxis Anxiety attack

Day 3 102.7; myalgia; fatigue; tracheitis; Respiration 40; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 64-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: El3426, expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 16Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cardiac hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on the left arm on 24Dec2020 at the age of 64 years old, lot number: Ek9231. On 16Jan2021 at 11:00 PM, the patient experienced faintness, fevers at 101.5 and 102.7 (on day 3), myalgia, fatigue, tracheitis for 3.5 days- stopped around 4AM on Wednesday, and respiration rate of 40. The patient has no COVID prior vaccination and has not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 101.5 on 16Jan2021, heart rate (HR): 80 on 16Jan2021, respiration: 40 on 16Jan2021 and body temperature: 102.7 on 20Jan2021. No treatment was administered for the events. The patient recovered from the event tracheitis on 20Jan2021 at 04:00 while recovering from the rest of the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Faint cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs.

A 64-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm at age 64 years, on 29Mar2021 14:25 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation as a pre-existing condition that normally she would be in atrial fibrillation for 3-8 hours, or maybe 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours at the most and overweight from unspecified date but working on it. Only she has heart history in her family. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications was none. Patient historically took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot: EN6199) with anatomical Location of left arm on 08Mar2021 around 1300 for COVID-19 immunization and flu vaccine received back in 2020 for immunisation.  Patient reported that she had the second dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine on Monday, 29Mar2021 and three hours later, her heart started fibrillating for 36 hours. She has a pre-existing condition of atrial fibrillation and normally she would be in atrial fibrillation for 3-8 hours, or maybe 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours at the most, never 36 hours. Patient contacted the doctor right away via phone. Her doctor, an electrophysiologist, stated not to eat or drink anything after midnight and of patient was still in atrial fibrillation in the morning they would have to perform a cardioversion, with the paddles. Doctor believed this could happen and said its a delicate balance when you put anything else into the system that it could affect persons. On 31Mar2021 at 05:15 that morning, the patient went out of atrial fibrillation and back into normal sinus rhythm. Patient only called the doctor and would have had to go in today if the fibrillation did not stop. Patient also stated that well, it was not a good thing to fibrillate for that long, with due time it can cause congestive heart failure and stated its dangerous. Patient was resting at the time of report and was relieved she is not fibrillating anymore. Patient reported that her body feels like it was hit with a mac truck on Mar2021. Heart fibrillating for 36 hours makes you really tired. The outcome of the event &#39;heart started fibrillating for 36 hours/she would be in atrial fibrillation for 3-8 hours, or maybe 10 hours, sometimes 12 hours at the most, never 36 hours&#39; was recovered on 31Mar2021 at 05:15 in the morning, while for the rest of the events it was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                my auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it.   My auntie, passed away the next two days after she got her Pfizer Covid vaccine.   My auntie, who is 65 years old, got her Pfizer vaccine the the morning of April 22 2021. She told us he was completely find on the day of the vaccine. But the next morning around 9 am, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  The reported death reason is due to Bowel Ischemia with Perforation and it has nothing to do with Pfizer vaccine that she got. But I believe it is her post Pfizer covid vaccine reaction that result in Bowel Ischemia with Perforation.  My auntie lived with a very healthy life style. She walked every morning, and has a shorter walk in the evening. She has no blood pressure, no blood sugar, everything is fine with her medical check.  My auntie had a kidney transplant 20&#43; years ago and she is on the track for monthly doctor visit. When she asked her general doctor if she could get the vaccine, her general doctor asked her to consult her kidney doctor. She then went to ask her kidney doctor and her kidney doctor call her general doctor to discuss her health conditions. Both of her doctor decided that she could take the vaccine and one of the doctor registered her for the vaccine on April 15 2021. The she nurse told her to came in for vaccine on Apr 22, and she is now death after the Pfizer vaccine.    I only read about people with recent organ transplant is not recommended to take the Covid vaccine. But there is no information about people that ever had kidney transplant shouldn?t take the vaccine.   My auntie, who was trying to be supportive and to get vaccinated just passed away like this is not worse it without a clear explanation.   I would like you to contact health department to follow up on this case and find out the real root cause. If the vaccine is not recommended for people that ever got kidney transplant, CDC should publish the information so that there won?t be more victims.   Please take necessary action ASAP.     Thank you!

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

                                                Vaccine 10 am- fine all day and evening.  Awoke at 3:40 am and rolled off of arm where injection given and a wave of pain and nausea and malaise overwhelmed me. I passed completely out still lying in bed (so out that I wet myself in bed) and gradually came to, still feeling horrible. Got up, changed clothes, and major chills when I returned to bed. Around 6am I felt nauseous, got up to vomit, but instead passed completely out on the bathroom floor for about 15 minutes.  Remainder of day I felt very stiff, low energy and slightly woozy. By afternoon, energy was returning (I vacuumed the house). Minimal pain in arm this time compared to previous.

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Creatinine was near her baseline at 1.8.  She did have elevated alkaline phosphatase at 452.  White count was elevated at 14.7.  Patient was difficult to arouse in the ER.   On my exam, patient is difficult to arouse.  After shaking her shoulder and yelling at her, she did open her eyes and say to me &#34;I&#39;m ok&#34; before closing her eyes again.  She is satting well on nasal canula oxygen.

Managed to get to sleep, but woke up at 1:15 am and could not get back to sleep.  Feeling chilled all night. At 5:30 am, got out of bed to take Tylenol and experienced dizziness (briefly blacked-out), sweats, nausea (vomited) and slight diarrhea. After that episode, started to feel a little better, though still a bit woozy and exhausted from lack of sleep.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left, on 27Feb2021 (lot# EN6205), as 0.3 ml single, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included seizure from 2017 (she hasn&#39;t had a seizure in 8 months), allergy (to a lot of things). Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have other vaccinations in 4 weeks prior. Within 15 minutes from having the vaccination at the center the patient experienced the first seizure that lasted about an hour. The seizure was really bad, she had breathing issues, dry heaving like she was trying to throw up, mucus to come out. The paramedics checked her out, they stayed around until she came out of the seizure. The patient went home and then at 07:50 PM she started heavy shallow breathing, was nauseous, dizzy, had a headache, which also happened at the center. Ears became hypersensitive, it was so noisy like loud, but her husband and the paramedics said it wasn&#39;t loud but she could hear it, all of her senses were heightened. She had a second seizure and didn&#39;t known how long it lasted. Patient had another seizure at 08:25 PM, at 08:40 PM she had another one, at 09:00 PM patient was coming back around and had another seizure and her throat closed up and that&#39;s when she went to the hospital, when her throat started to close up. While the patient was in the emergency room (ER) she had another seizure, she had 6 total seizures, she has never had this many before so she knows it was an adverse event to this vaccination. The seizures also increased the patient&#39;s heart enzymes- troponin levels. The patient has an EEG, was given 4 baby chewable Aspirin, as she had a mild heart attack. She thought the seizure increased her troponin. The patient  mentioned that during the first event at the center, she was so into the seizures, she remembers grabbing her left shoulder, her arm was hurting. She was so into the seizure and trying to throwing up that it didn&#39;t dawn on her. The hospital didn&#39;t tell her she had a mild heart attack, it just dawned on her because her troponin levels were up mildly and she thought the seizures were triggering something in her heart, not just her seizures. The patient got another headache and was dizzy and had shallowing breathing. Seizures recovered on 28Feb2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included chest x-ray: normal, it didn&#39;t show pneumonia or fluid on the lungs on 27Feb2021, electrocardiogram (EKG): normal on unspecified date, electroencephalogram (EEG): normal on 27Feb2021, troponin: increased on 27Feb2021.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

A 65-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: Jun2021), as single dose in left shoulder on 04Mar2021 at noon for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from May2012 and ongoing (autoimmune condition), ongoing undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) (autoimmune condition, unsure when diagnosed, started with polymyalgia rheumatica, then it went to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), then it went between Lupus and undifferentiated connective tissue disease), hospitalization: she had to go hospital twice in last 4 months, one was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril as another blood pressure medication, she had 2 mild anaphylactic reactions in the last 4 months from amlodipine and Lisinopril, patient thought they all have PEG in the ingredients; underwent colonoscopy unknown results. There were no concomitant medications.  On 04Mar2021 the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, gasping for air, headache, dizzy, could not think clearly/her thinking was not clear, tongue swelling, swollen lips, throat closing/restriction in her throat, confused , sensation in her chest, weak, fatigued, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips.  Course of events was as follows: The patient drove two hours to get the vaccine. The patient was vaccinated on 04Mar2021 at noon. The reaction started immediately, the caller had a severe headache within seconds, a little bit of sensation in her chest. The patient&#39;s thoughts were getting mixed up, she was not thinking clearly. This was one of first things that happened. The patient stumbled a little bit and the nurses were there around her and said she better sit down now. Then the sensation in her throat was starting to feel like it was closing up, her lips were swollen; so she would say she was a little bit confused. The patient started getting dizzy and her thinking was not clear, her tongue swelled, she had a full tongue which effecting her talking, she was gasping for air, she needed a moment to regulate her breathing. In regards to swollen lips she added at first she had a tickle in the throat, tingling in her lips, restriction in her throat, then she started slurring her words before the ambulance got there.  On site they responded and watched her because she did not know if the symptoms were going to get worse. The paramedics gave the caller oxygen and an IV, since she had a mild experience she wanted to see what she did not take any medications before taking the vaccine so she could see what it would do, she did not take an ibuprofen or Tylenol. Patient commented, she knew it was not recommended, but some people do it. The patient mentioned started speaking very badly and very fast, she started gulping for air, and was informed the histamines are hitting her.  She felt like she was going to faint, she thought if she was able to count back from ten she was going to be knocked out. Once she counted back she started to feel better. Like she would not faint. She did not faint often. She mentioned counting backwards from ten when getting a colonoscopy or something like don&#39;t get passed five and then knocked out, so she knows the sensation that can occur. After 1.5 hours they decided to call the emergency number and that was when the ambulance came. The ambulance service was the one who did everything for the patient. Because the patient got in the ambulance, they required her to go to the hospital, she was in a bed in the hall, by the time her doctor had looked at her, her throat had opened up and was feeling reasonably well after an hour an half.

The patient was on an IV and they gave her 125 mg of Solu-Medrol, 50 mg of Benadryl, and 5 mg of nausea medicine, phedrol the caller thought it was called. They did a good job and that helped the patient down from the most severe symptoms and she wanted to report her symptoms.  The patient has been looking around and she thought this reaction it was from the polyethylene glycol. She mentioned historically she had a minor reaction. She had to go hospital twice in last four months. One was for Amlodipine which has polyethylene glycol and another time for Lisinopril which is another blood pressure medication. She confirmed she visited the emergency room for all 3 of these cases. The patient was still very confused on 09Mar2021 and over the weekend, she had to rest, she was weak and fatigued. On 09Mar2021 it was first real day she went back to work. She worked and asked her brother to watch out for her.

Patient asked if there was a conclusion about the PEG and her anaphylactic reaction. Her second dose was scheduled on 25Mar2021. Patient stated that her PCP and the CDC recommend to not get the second dose. Caller wanted to know if the anaphylaxis could be worse in the second dose. The patient wanted to know if she should she get the next dose. She was very concerned about COVID as well but did not know if it&#39;s worth her risking her life.

                                                April 22, 2021 morning my auntie got her first dose of Pfizer vaccine. She happily shared here vaccine experience with family member and relative.  April 23 morning, she told us she has  severe abdominal pain, has the need to have a bowel movement, but she was defecated. She also told us that she vomit couple times already,  then she has no more energy to talk. She got into the hospital and she was announced death right after midnight at 12:04 April 25th.  Reason of death given is &#34;septic shock secondary to ischemic bowel &amp; intra-abdominal sepsis&#34;.   But it is the blood clots issue that is causing it.   I was told that after my auntie got into hospital the very next day after Pfizer vaccine, hospital later found out that my auntie has blood blockage issue that is causing blood couldn&#39;t flow to her intestines. The acid in her blood was very high, 6&#43;.  After more than 6 hours without blood to her intestines, her intestines tissues start dying and turned black color. Doctor found out about this at the night of April 23, 2021 nighttime. April 22, 2021 morning is the day my auntie got her Pfizer covid vaccine.  There is a very high chances of the Pfizer vaccine is causing the blood clots that lead to blood blockages.

                                                stroke; face sunk in and changed/Bells Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 16Mar2021 at 14:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included a mild case of COVID-19, last year, on an unspecified date in 2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. On 21Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face sunk in and changed. The patient&#39;s symptoms were not improving. Her eye and right side of her face are affected. She cannot close her right eye. She worked on it and is now able to close right eye not like the left eye closes, but it doesn&#39;t blink as the left eye does. She has been using eye drops for this. She said it was Bells Palsy. The patient added that it is hard to look in the mirror. She will not get the second dose. She was not interested in taking the vaccine now.  She wanted to wait and see. It being so new and see. Her sister took it and encouraged her, and said it is necessary because they like to travel. She got Prednisone when she was at the hospital, they gave her 60mg Prednisone. Her physician didn&#39;t want to keep her on it too long and said it may cause other complications.  Her physician cut her off, she weaned her down 50mg, 40mg, 30mg, 20mg, then 10mg. When the patient noticed her face start to turn, she went to the ER. She thought she was having a stroke. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The outcome of the event face sunk in and changed/bells palsy was not recovered while the outcome of the event stroke was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient (pregnant at the time of vaccination: no) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) via intramuscular at left arm on 11Jan2021 12:15 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diastolic CHF, spinal stenosis, morbid obesity, epilepsy, pulmonary hypertension and COVID-19 (Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19). The patient received medication within 2 weeks of vaccination included amiodarone, melatonin, venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR), ibuprofen, aripiprazole (ABILIFY), lisinopril, cranberry capsules, diltiazem, paracetamol (TYLENOL), famotidine, furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]), ipratropium bromide, salbutamol sulfate (IPRATROPIUM/ALBUTEROL), buspirone, senna alexandrina leaf (SENNA [SENNA ALEXANDRINA LEAF]), polyethylene glycol 3350 and morphine. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient used took Penicillin, propranolol, quetiapine, topiramate, Lamictal and had allergy to them. Patient used took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EJ1685) via intramuscular at right arm on 21Dec2020 12:00 PM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination, the patient been tested for COVID-19 (Sars-cov-2 PCR) via nasal swab on 06Jan2021, covid test result was negative.

Outcome of pulseless and breathless was unknown. the autopsy was performed, and autopsy remarks was unknown. Autopsy-determined cause of death was unknown.  It was reported as non-serious, not results in death, Life threatening, caused/prolonged hospitalization, disabling/Incapacitating nor congenital anomaly/birth defect.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information this patient had multiple underlying medical conditions including morbid obesity, diastolic CHF, epilepsy, pulmonary hypertension and COVID-19 diagnosed prior to vaccination. All these conditions more likely contributed to patients cardiac arrest resulting in death. However, based on a close temporal association (&#34;Patient was found pulseless and breathless 20 minutes following the second dose of BNT162B2 vaccine administration, contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine to the onset of reported events cannot be completely excluded.

                                                2 days after vaccination right thighs and right leg started to have pain similar to pain I got with polymyalgia rheumatica that I have had in past and I though it was a flare up. A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

                                                large knot right above the injection site/size of a half dollar/size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot/like egg under the skin or clot; felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore; swelling started almost immediately after the shot/swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area/about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high; thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, lot number: EN6201, unknown expiration), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 at 04:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history reported as none. Concomitant medications included tolterodine and adalimumab (HUMIRA). The patient reported that she received the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 at around 4:30. Firstly it was fine, she felt like she got a flu shot and could tell her arm was very sore. What concerned her was the swelling started almost immediately after the shot on 18Feb2021. She knew that was one of the symptoms. This morning and yesterday though (18Feb2021), she noticed some of the symptoms. She got a large knot that was right above the injection site. Yesterday, it was about the size of a half dollar, today it is about the size of a silver dollar and where the needle went in was right at the base of that knot. It feels like an egg under the skin or a clot. Like a knot (a hard spot underneath the skin). The patient was wondering if it was something she should be concerned about because the swelling was exactly underneath the injection site, just in the pronounced area. It was a rectangle and is about 4 inches wide and about 2 inches high and then right above that was where the needle went in. The large circle or knot was right above that and she was thinking possibly when she was given the injection she has never really bleed before. So, she thought maybe someone has hit a vein because it did bleed and ran down her arm. She got no problem. That happens at times, but she started thinking if this was a clot or it was something that is right above there because it is so pronounced, and it really hurts. The patient stated that she took some Aspirin last night and is going to take an ibuprofen in a little while. She mentioned that she takes this one pill and it has nothing to do with anything.  The patient had lab work done (unknown results) that was about 3 weeks ago (2021). She also stated that she also take Humira which is a shot every 2 weeks and it said in the fact sheet that she should be concerned or be sure that she did not take any medicine that affects the immune system and Humira does weaken the immune system but she was not ask that prior to. The patient wanted to know if is that something she should be concerned about. Outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 66 years old female patient (weight: 107.95 kg, height: 165 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the left arm, on 04Mar2021, at 16:50, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included atrial fibrillation from Jan2016 and ongoing and cardiac ablation on an unspecified date, in Feb2020 (she had her 2nd ablation in Feb2020, since then she has had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation. She stated prior to the second vaccine she had been in normal sinus rhythm for 8 days). Patient stated that she had a sister who had an arrhythmia problem. The patient previously, on 10Feb2021, received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) in the left arm, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient stated that she had no problem with first dose. The patient received concomitant medications (unspecified). On 04Mar2021, at 21:00, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation and on 04Mar2021 she was tired. On 05Mar2021, she developed pain in the left arm. The patient recovered from pain in arm on 05Mar2021, from tiredness on 07Mar2021, while did not recover from atrial fibrillation.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

A 66-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 09Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included many allergies. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had other medications in two weeks but no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously had the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EL9263) on 20Jan2021 at 10:00 administered in the right arm for Covid-19 immunization. On 20Feb2021 at 12:00 (also reported as &#34;in February&#34;), the patient had a phlebitis in her right leg, a week later (Feb2021) a vascular surgeon office did an ultrasound and found a small blood clot. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The events were treated with Eliquis BID (twice a day) for 45 days. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal relationship between BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) and the event thrombosis cannot be excluded based on temporal association.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 66-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13Feb2021 14:00 (lot number: EL9264) as single dose at the age of 66 years old, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, spinal stenosis, arthritis and allergies to sulfa. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included insulin human zinc suspension (HUMULIN U), metformin, pioglitazone hydrochloride (ACTOS), fish oil, tocopherol (OMEGA 3) and valsartan; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bydureon, codeine and celebrex and experienced drug allergy with these medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 on 23Jan2021, at the age of 66 years old for COVID-19 immunization (Product: COVID 19, brand: Pfizer BIONTECH, lot number: EL3247, administration time: 03:00 PM, vaccine location: right arm). The patient did not receive any other vaccines four weeks prior to COVID vaccination. The patient had a stroke with expressive aphasia on 14Feb2021 20:00. The patient was hospitalized due to stroke with expressive aphasia for 5 days. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization. On unspecified dates, the patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CTS), laboratory test (labs), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tPA (plasminogen activator inhibitor); all with unknown results. Other tests include: negative COVID test (nasal swab) on 16Feb2021 and negative COVID test (blood test) on 03Mar2021. The patient had speech therapy as treatment for the events. The patient recovered with sequelae from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported  stroke with expressive aphasia is assessed as unrelated to the administration of vaccine BNT162B2 and can be explained as intercurrent medical condition in this elderly patient with underlying diabetes mellitus, hypertension and other comorbidities.

She wanted to report that she developed a blood clot in her right ankle. She went to the doctor yesterday on 06Apr2021. She would like to add she has no prior history of any type of blood issues. The doctor she saw thought that the blood clot and the Covid 19 vaccine could be related but would not commit to saying so directly. She started having issues about 6 days after the second Covid 19 vaccine. She doesn&#39;t exactly remember when, maybe the 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. She ignored the issues attributing them to over exercising. She reached a point where she couldn&#39;t ignore the issues anymore and went to the doctor. Caller clarifies she has a varicose vein in her right ankle and it started to hurt then her ankle on her right side started swelling. She only payed attention to her ankle when it got worse. The last 3 weeks have been awful. She would like it known that she does not lead a sedimentary lifestyle. She rides her bike 60 miles a week and walks 10 miles a week. She&#39;s always moving. This is unusual for her. The doctor she saw diagnosed her with a blood clot and he did a sonogram in his office. She has been prescribed Xarelto 15mg tablets. Take 2 tablets twice daily for the first 21 days then on the 22nd day start taking one 20mg tablet once daily. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sonogram: unknown result on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the all events was unknown.

A 66-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm on 17Mar2021 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 66 years old) (Lot Number: EN6205, unknown expiration) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing anxiety (40 years or more), ongoing depression (46 years ago, at the age of 20), ongoing acid reflux (maybe 25 years), ongoing GERD (maybe 25 years), ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus (for 12 years), mild to moderate COPD since 2011, gastric bypass (a year and a half ago), and lost 120 pounds. Concomitant medications included bupropion for anxiety depression and omeprazole for acid reflux, both ongoing.  The patient previously received flu and tetanus on unspecified dates for immunization and both experienced hard red welt on arm (welt was hard and lasted for 5-7 days). The patient reported no side effects for 12 hours, but a little soreness at injection site on 17Mar2021 at 20:00 (8:00 PM). Her arm wasn&#39;t heavy, but she had an awareness of the soreness.  She has had life-long anxiety and depression. Several weeks ago (on 26Mar2021), her anxiety reared up, and it could have been due to a family situation. On the 9th day after the first shot, she was having a therapy appointment on the phone and talking about her anxiety, and she got a stiff neck, like an iron claw (26Mar2021 at 10:00 am). It lasted for a couple of 5 minutes and she laid down on the couch then on the floor.  Her therapist said to call 911. Emergency medical technicians came to her house and they said all of her numbers looked good.  She went to the hospital, and was in the emergency room for several hours, but she only remembers one hour of it.  She also had diarrhea and nausea on 26Mar2021 at 11:30, and it felt like Dumping Syndrome, that one can have from a gastric bypass. She was only aware for one hour at that point and blacked out (on 26Mar2021). With regards to nausea, she mostly saw bile in the bag, all she had that day was a protein drink. She was back home and the next day, she did not remember how she got home. She hasn&#39;t had blackouts anymore but feels it may be from heightened anxiety.  On 27Mar2021 at 09:00, she had no appetite, lost 6 pounds in a week, and was tired. She had headache lasted for days and days on 29Mar2021 at 09:00 AM. She is slowly improving but she still doesn&#39;t sleep through the night on 29Mar2021 at 16:00. It was like a feeling like she was resetting her surgery, like she didn&#39;t care about eating.  The also experienced back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica on 31Mar2021 at 16:00 and was constipated. She is using a stool softener and is back in her routine. She called her primary doctor and could not tell her what happened, and she went in a loop trying to get information and authorizations for her to make a determination of what had happened.  Her doctor felt like she should have an MRI. Her heart and all of her numbers looked good, as the emergency medical technicians said. Her primary doctor recommended her to get the second shot.  She had cancelled the second shot for this week, and she has rescheduled it for another date.  She was afraid that she will black out again, after the next vaccine, and is not sure if that is how her anxiety manifested. The main reasons she is calling is that she had no concerns of side effects prior to the vaccine, and a couple of her neighbors said they had read about side effects of the vaccine, but she was not worried.  When the patient started to read about side effects of the vaccine, she understood that on the 10th day, the vaccine starts to be in a person&#39;s system and that maybe is why she didn&#39;t have initial side effects, but then she had side effects several days later because the vaccine was in her body.  By day 10, the vaccine is in effect in the body and she is nervous. Her second vaccine is scheduled on 26Apr2021. The patient would like to know if there is any information on people that have had a gastric bypass. The patient has no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The events resulted in emergency room visit (except nervous). The patient recovered from soreness at injection site on 18Mar2021; recovered from diarrhea, nausea,  felt like Dumping Syndrome on 26Mar2021; recovered from stiff neck on 26Mar2021 at 10:05am; recovered from constipation on 02Apr2021; and recovered from no appetite and lost 6 pounds on unspecified dates. The patient also recovered from headache with sequelae on unspecified date; and recovered from blacked out on 27Mar2021 with sequelae. The patient had not yet recovered from anxiety reared up; tired; doesn&#39;t sleep through the night; back pain, butt and legs hurt, feels like sciatica.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

The Company considers the reported event fibromyalgia flare up is unrelated to bnt162b2 vaccine but more likely due to underlying medical history of ongoing fibromyalgia.

The morning after the second injection around 4 am, she had site on her arm soreness, erratic body temperature with slight fever, horrible headache, bodyaches, and dry heaves. Her lymph nodes also swelled up again.  Caller clarifies that this also happened after her first injection of the Pfizer Covid19 vaccine and on a similar timeline. Caller clarifies that 2 weeks later on 26Feb2021 she had ended up with horrible headache, dry heaves, headache, body temperature 104.4. She states that this lasted Friday night and Saturday night and Sunday she was feeling better. Clarifies that was the week of 26Feb2021.

Caller clarifies that she was admitted to (Hospital Name) on 01Mar2021. Caller adds that she went to the hospital 2 weeks after the second dose. She states that is what makes them wonder if it is from the Covid vaccine. Adds that she is not saying that is what caused all of this, but that it is just a coincidence that it was exactly 2 weeks after the vaccine, exactly 2 weeks out when this happened. She states that she has been thinking if she should be wasting Pfizers time reporting this but it could be a coincidence or maybe a reaction.  Caller adds maybe it is because she had 34 radiations, 8 chemo treatments, 1 year of Herceptine, and breast cancer.  States that maybe she can save somebody else, or if a possibility, people can be prepared two weeks early.  She adds that she is lucky she did not break an arm, leg. or bone.  States that she doesn&#39;t know if maybe she can save some other person by sharing this information. Injection site sore:  States that this was after both first and second vaccine.

With the first vaccine, injection site soreness started 14Jan2021 around 10 pm and completely resolved after about a week.  She adds that with the second vaccine she also noticed injection site soreness that same day on 04Feb2021 around 10 pm also. She adds that it lasted about six days or seven days or so.

Lymph nodes swollen: States noticed swelling at 4 AM 16Jan2021.  States this occurred 4 am after both first and second injection.  Occurred to groin area, right arm, and left arm. It was there for a couple of days and then it would just remind her it was there.  The arm lymph node swelling went away after a few days, maybe before a week or so. The one in the groin was there for about two weeks. On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 1.5 and was not something that people need to take an Advil or something for. Clarifies it was in the armpit except in the left side because they took those lymph nodes out during surgery in 2008.  Also, she noticed lymph node swelling in the chest area. Lymph Nodes at second vaccine she also noticed them starting at about 4 am after the vaccine and it started hurting again. Caller reiterates both shots were given at 3:30 pm and then at 10 pm injection site gets sore.Then 4 am injection site gets more sore. She&#39;s been telling everybody to get the vaccine in the morning.  Her symptoms lasted two weeks and then she was fine. Caller adds that her husband never felt a thing from receiving the vaccine.  She states that the injection site was tender on her husband but gone the next day. Investigations: stated they looked at her in the hospital and said she was fine. The girl came back up and did more cultures and nothing grew.  They were confused and so was she and she has been debating whether to call and waste time reporting but thinks that Pfizer needs to know what happened to her.

                                                blood clot; Right leg swelled and achy; Right leg swelled and achy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EP7534),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 16Mar2021 (at the age of 67years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Beta thalassemias. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient stated she has never had a problem with vaccinations, and she gets the flu vaccine every year. The patient reported that after the first injection coincidentally she did develop a blood clot in her lower leg. She thinks that it was due to a plane ride, but she has never had a blood clot before the injection. She added that she had the first dose on 16Mar2021 and developed a clot in a week. She further clarified that she got her first injection on 16Mar2021 and realized when she went on a flight, which is not that far she developed that clot and was having problems shortly after flight home on 24Mar2021 where her leg swelled up and she is on blood thinners since she went to the emergency room. She added that she developed the clot sometime between that flight and 02Apr2021. She had a doppler study on an unspecified date and it showed a blood clot.  She stated that the outcome was she does not have the blood clot (as reported) but she will be on blood thinners and she needs to follow up on her scan to see if the clot issue is resolved but she will not have a doppler scan for another month or two and the blood thinner she is taking is Xarelto. She also stated that her right leg swelled up and it felt like a log. She reported it felt achy and swollen quite a bit from knee down and her leg was achy. It started between 24Mar2021 and by time she went to the emergency room she was not getting better. She had her symptoms for a week and toward the end of the week she thought she had a blood clot since it was not getting better it just got worse. She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better. The outcome of events was recovering. (As reported &#34;outcome is unknown but pretty sure it has improved because of the blood thinners&#34;./She stated she does not think it has resolved because it takes time for clots to resolve./She added that right now it is not swollen but she has been supine, and she does believe that it is better.)  The reporter stated for the seriousness criteria for event blood clot: she believes as a nurse that any blood clot is extremely dangerous, and she was not hospitalized but obviously a blood clot is serious, and she could have ended up with pulmonary embolism. The seriousness for events right leg swelled and achy was reported as medically disabling.  Causality assessment: Patient stated for the blood clot she has doubts if it was related to the vaccine but is it something that should be known about; for the leg swelling and achy she has doubts but it could have been the plane ride.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the reported events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is unlikely related to the suspected drug. The plane ride may provide an explanation for the events.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 67-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: EN6208) intramuscular, administered in Arm Left, at the age of 67-year-old, on 19Mar2021 11:00, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma and Allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number EN6203) single dose, at the age of 67-year-old, on 26Feb2021, for covid-19 immunisation and experienced slight ache in her left arm, headaches, and mitral valve disease.  On 20Mar2021, the patient had headaches off and on and the patient mostly woke up with them. The patient doesn&#39;t know if the headaches were from pollen in the air since it is Spring time or mold. On 24Mar2021 at 4am, the patient got out of bed because she had to use the restroom. As soon as the patient took the first step into the tile floor of the bathroom, the patient collapsed. The patient didn&#39;t fall, the patient collapsed on the file floor. Her head hit the floor. Her head was killing her when she was laying there. The patient used the restroom and went back to bed. The patient got out of bed because her head was killing her. The patient guesses she threw her right arm out to brace herself, because she noticed her right arm was bruised the morning of 24Mar2021 when she went to shower. The patient took Equate 500MG for the events head hit the tile floor of bathroom, headache, and right arm was bruised and used a wash cloth with cold water as a cold compress and applied it by her eyebrow, the corner of her eye was purple/bruised. It looked like she had eyeshadow on. On 24Mar2021, she was feeling nauseated. Thankfully, she had the next 2 days off  (Thursday and Friday) because she didn&#39;t feel so hot. On 26Mar2021, the patient called her PCP and was asked if she wanted to come in/ make an appointment. Since, the caller was planning to meet with the surgeon about her upcoming surgery on 29Mar2021, it didn&#39;t really fit into her schedule. She was undergoing all these tests, etc. It was determined her surgery was going to happen after receiving the second vaccine. The surgery is hopefully a mitral valve repair. The patient mentioned that her provider is aware of her experience with the COVID vaccine. The patient saw the surgeon on 29Mar2021, and she told him all about her experience. He advised the patient to call her PCP and schedule an appointment with them. She saw her PCP on 01Apr2021. She told her PCP what happened and her PCP asked why she didn&#39;t go to urgent care. The patient doesn&#39;t really know why she didn&#39;t, she just thought she was going to feel better. The patient thought she would work through the pain since Mar2021. Plus, she had everything going on with her surgery- like finding out she had to have the surgery and going under other tests. Her PCP wanted her to go to radiology to have a MRI of the head/brain done. She had the MRI done at 3:00PM on 06Apr2021 and the results were negative. Up until last weekend, she still felt &#34;headachy&#34;. The patient has headaches too because of stress knowing her surgery was scheduled in a matter of 2 weeks, so she didn&#39;t know if the headaches she was experiencing was because of the COVID vaccine, stress, allergies, etc. The patient was certain the headache she experienced the day after she collapsed, was due to the collapse. The patient clarified that she knew it was more of a &#34;collapse&#34; instead of a fall because all the furniture leading to the bathroom, like the loveseat, lamp, cedar chest, etc, were all intact with no marks. It was like all of a sudden she collapsed. Her bruising is all gone, but there might be a slight mark that is like yellow and green (because the bruising changes colors) on her arm. Her eye was okay. The patient will have her planned surgery on 15Apr2021. The events required physician office visit. The patient underwent unspecified lab test and procedures relevant to her upcoming surgery but no other testing in regards to her symptoms after the COVID vaccine. Outcome of headache was not recovered, the events corner of her eye was purple/bruised and right arm was bruised recovered in 2021, while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                arm soreness; community acquired pneumonia; COPD; shortness of breath; chest congestion; weakness; fatigue; Muscle aches and pains; she became ill; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse from a Pfizer-sponsored program Pfizer First Connect. A 68-years-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 06Jan2021 at single dose on right deltoid for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood pressure high and seasonal allergies. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot: EJ1685) on 16Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced community acquired pneumonia, shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness, fatigue, COPD, muscle aches and pains, she became ill, all on12Jan2021; arm soreness on an unspecified date. Events required Emergency Room visit. Clinical course reported as: she got the second dose of the pfizer covid vaccine on 06Jan2021 and on 12Jan2021 she experienced shortness of breath, chest congestion, weakness and fatigue. Nurse stated ER doctor thought she had COPD or community acquired pneumonia. Nurse further stated she had the second COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021. A week later on 12Jan2021, she became ill. She had all the symptoms of COVID. She was short of breath, very fatigued. She couldn&#39;t get any air, she was at work. She had muscle aches and pains. The shortness of breath, fatigue and weakness lasted several days. She also had severe chest congestion. She confirmed she got better. It actually took 4 or 5 days. By that Sunday (17Jan2021) she was better. She wanted it noted she had no reaction right after the shot. She stated she only had arm soreness, it was just a little sore, not even worth mentioning. It was only when she moved her arm a certain way. This was with either vaccine (first or second vaccine). She went to the doctor and somebody thought it might be a reaction, but the nurse thought it was too late for a reaction. The ER doctor thought it was COPD and community acquired pneumonia. Her primary doctor thought it was COPD. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 test: negative on 12Jan2021. Outcome of arm soreness was unknown, others was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the drug-event time interval and the vaccine&#39;s safety profile, the  community acquired pneumonia is possibly intercurrent condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162B2 administration, which is not the disease that the vaccine BNT162B2 can prevent from. While the COPD is more likely underlying condition, unrelated to vaccine BNT162 injection.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli; pulmonary hypertension; short of breath; right heart strain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 68-year-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER COVID 19 VACCINE, lot number=EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration at right arm on 22Dec2020 08:00 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included uveitis, arthritis and known allergies: pine nuts. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination. The patient did not test for COVID post vaccination. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medication included prednisone (eye gtt), naproxen as needed (PRN) less than weekly.  The patient previously took theophylline and experienced allergies. The day after getting the first dose of vaccine the patient worked all day in another (clinic withheld). She felt well all day, but at 6 pm when she left to go to her car she was so short of breath she had to stop twice to get there. Subsequent work up has shown that she had multiple bilateral Pulmonary emboli resulting in pulmonary hypertension and right heart strain. Adverse event start date was 23Dec2020. Adverse event start time was 06:00 PM. The adverse events resulted in: [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization for 1 day, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event)]. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events included Lovenox and Eliquis. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile the reported events are unlikely related to bnt162b2 .  These are probably intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

ED Course: is a 68 year old female with CAD s/p PCI, HLD, OSA, seizures, HTN, asthma who presents after anaphylaxis following 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Chest tightness and original EKG concerning for STEMI, but on review EKG was artifact and did not evolve. Normal sinus the following day with resolution of symptoms. Epipen also improved symptoms which would be inconsistent with ischemia. Patient respiratory status improved on prednisone and breathing treatments. Patient is now stable for discharge.

She continues it was on the neck down to the collar bone around the back of her neck, like if she was a bust statue it would be all in that area from the collar bones at that point up and around the back of the shoulder blades. It goes all the way around face and neck. Patient also further reported that she had a scary reaction last night (07Mar2021), she said she had blood in her stool, leaking blood around rectum and it had like a burning itch, when she wiped it was blood, she continued to say when she wiped it was like &#39;giblets.&#39; She stated was stool, blood, and giblets. Patient stated this lasted for about and hour and half or 2 hours until the stool stopped and it was about 1:30 am before she finally went to sleep, she was so tired on an unspecified date. She stated she took Benadryl right away. She continued to report the bleeding has resolved completely as of this point and reported a regular bowel movement today (08Mar2021). She has two Epi Pens from the drug store that was prescribed but she was afraid to use it, and she thought to see what happens if she uses the Benadryl. She received the Epi shot at the drug store, at (pharmacy), when her reaction broke out, on 06Mar2021, in her thigh, for the allergic reaction. This was her first time ever receiving EpiPen (Lot 029F20AA, expiration Mar2022, and NDC is 0093-5986-27). The ER doctor prescribed her 0.3 mg every 5-15 minutes as needed for anaphylaxis, and not to exceed 3 doses. She received the Benadryl at the drug store, 120mg tablet, first dose was given at drug store. Patient reported she was given prednisone IV in hand through IV at ER, she doesn&#39;t know how much that was, then was given Prednisone to go home with- 20mg tablets take 2 a day for 4 days, which she started Sunday morning, 07Mar2021. She was told she experienced a life threatening allergic reaction. Patient was taken to the ER in the ambulance, the paramedic who was with her said she was his first COVID reaction patient. ER doctor told her not to take the second dose of Pfizer vaccine, and to be cautious if taking the EpiPen, she states her heart was racing because of the EpiPen and was told it was because she was not younger that her body did not handle the Epi like younger people do and was told she could have a heart attack from the EpiPen. She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine. She was afraid of the Epi-Pen since she can get a heart attack from it because of her age. The patient mentioned she was tested in Oct (clarified as 14Oct2020) for Covid due to having a viral infection at that time but was negative. Added the ER paper work says ED anaphylaxis. The patient wanted to ask about finding out the ingredients in Pfizer vaccine and the ingredients in the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. She saw the list on the fact sheet of Pfizer&#39;s ingredients and in a few places it says Potassium, 3 different ingredients, and several months ago, she quit eating bananas, bananas have potassium, and they were giving her stomach upset, diarrhea, she used to eat them all her life, she noticed that there was a lot of potassium in the medicine. Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot. The anaphylactic reaction required emergency room visit. Patient was not hospitalized and was in observation in ER. On 08Mar2021, the patient recovered from blood in stool, rectal bleeding, and burning and itching with bleeding. The patient had not yet recovered from severe allergic reaction, hot face and neck was flushed, tingling in tongue, lips, face; lips were puffy, and rash.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

Regarding gallbladder attack the patient reported that it was controlled until further tests and surgery were performed.

Felt terrible head spinning and unable to get up/ Crawled to bed; Live alone. Could not even find the telephone; Woke up and tried to get up.  Freezing cold. Finally called Ambulance Their doctor refused to send an ambulance and said &#34; go to your GP its not an emergency&#34;. I was disgusted barely could walk but somehow drove to the GP. he was closed so went to emergency. the Dr in charge of the vaccination center was there but did not accept it was the vaccine; Finally on the verge of collapse another lady took me to the entrance of emergency. I was finally seen:; Same thing. Dr there told me its not an emergency and to go and see my GP. I was so sick and told him th eGP was not there; His reply &#34; There are plenty of others to see&#34;  It was the nurse who persisted and even  thought may be I had covid and did the PCR test. I started uncontrollably shivering and was freezing. I had a fever. they did blood tests lung x ray and finally a urine test, Full of blood leucocytes and protein. The same wonderful nurse said its bad. I was by then vomitting again and thought I would die; Uncontrollable shivering ;  taken to the lab or a pelvic cat scan;Couldnt even get to sip water. SEVEN hours later the  same DR who told me I was not an emergency came in and said &#34; You will have to be hospitalised as you have a serious kidney infection. Acute pyelonephritis. I vomitted on him!  Taken to a ward 25 March until 29 March. Rocephin antibiotics. Allergy to that too with migraines and skin rash; They changed the antibiotics.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 (Lot Number: EN6198) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included mild stroke from 18Jan2020 and not ongoing, suspected she had atrial fibrillation and she had a heart monitor placed 21Feb2020. Her heart monitor never showed Atrial Fibrillation after one year of being monitored. Ongoing low thyroid/hypothyroidism and blood cholesterol increased from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for low thyroid/hypothyroidism from an unspecified start date (started probably been 10 years) and ongoing; atorvastatin taken for reduce cholesterol from 2020 (started right after she had stroke, either Jan2020 or Feb2020) and ongoing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 01Mar2021 (at age of 68 years old, Lot Number: EN6200) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. She was fine right after the first dose. She only had a sore arm for 3 days. Just last week, she had a severe adverse reaction right after her vaccine. With the second dose, she had everything possible. Twelve hours after, on 23Mar2021 at 03:00, she awoke to throw up.  She thinks she fainted.  She had to throw up 2 more times that night. She had been wearing a heart monitor. On 24Mar2021 her cardiologist called her and told her she had a 19 second pause of no heartbeat and was in a 3rd degree heart block. The very next morning, they put in a pacemaker. She was overall healthy and athletic. She was a runner and golfs all the time. She had an outpatient procedure for the pacemaker placement at the hospital on 25Mar2021. She was still recovering but improving. Caller added it was scary when your heart stops. Caller added she did not see this as a possible related side effect, but that evening when she was not feeling well, 22Mar2021, she checked her oxygen level with her oximeter. It was 93 and usually runs around 99. It is back to normal now. She checked it the night she was vomiting. Stated this was before the third degree heart block by a few hours. She did not think it was related. All her symptoms are gone other than the placement of her pacemaker. The outcome of the events &#34; 19 second pause of no heartbeat and in third degree heart block&#34; was recovering. The outcome of the event &#34; Oxygen saturation decreased&#34; was recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.

Presented to the ED on 4/21/21 with hypotension, bradycardia, hypoxia and a GCS of 3.   Does have a history of ESRD on HD, but no missed dialysis sessions. Found to have a potassium of 8.7.  There was concern for pulmonary embolism but was not hemodynamically stable enough to undergo imaging.   Went into PEA arrest x 3 in the ED and ultimately died.  Of note, patient did have a recent ankle fracture recently and apparently has been non-ambulatory for at least the past few days.

                                                stroke; R sided weakness; expressive aphagia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A non-pregnant 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 05Feb2021 (at age of 68 years old, no pregnant, Lot Number: EN5318) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included type 1 diabetes, hypertension (HTN). The patient not had COVID prior vaccination also not had COVID tested post vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included insulin, lisinopril and Multi vitamin. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 15Jan2021 at 03:00 P.M. (at age of 68 years old, Batch/Lot number unknown) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient received 2nd Covid shot on 05Feb2021. Had a stroke on 14Feb2021 at 08:00 AM with R sided weakness and expressive aphagia. Stroke noted on MRI in L hemisphere, speech area. The patient had no idea if this was related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine. AE resulted in: Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization (1 day), Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Treatment received for events included observation, Lovenox. The outcome of the events was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Stroke, Weakness left or right side, and Expressive aphasia cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A 69-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at 12:30 at single dose in left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included R.A.D., osteopenia, migraine with aura, the patient had previously suffered episodes of vasal vagal syncopy when she got the flu or other severe illnesses, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medication included atenolol, atorvastatin, azelastine, and fluticasone. The patient previously took gramicidin, neomycin sulfate, polymyxin b sulfate (NEOSPORIN) and experienced allergies. The morning after receiving the vaccine, she felt quite sick, like she had the flu. When she got up from bed and went to the bathroom to urinate, she became very lightheaded and dizzy. She attempted to return to bed, but passed out on the bedroom floor before she could get to the bed, and seized while she was unconscious. Once she came to, she was helped to bed and, after about 90 minutes, felt much better, and got up, and ate food and had coffee. All events occurred at 07:30 AM on 09Jan2021. All events were reported as non-serious by reporter. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events was resolved in Jan2021.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EM9810) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 26Feb2021 15:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included calcium carbonate (OS-CAL) and vitamin. The patient previously took BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunisation (first dose on the left arm at 01:30 PM, lot number: EL 1283); and SHINGRIX vaccine in 2019, codeine and cipro and experienced allergies. On 27Feb2021 03:30 PM, the patient experienced chills, fatigue &amp; then sudden nausea &amp; lightheadedness that resulted in passing out. Unfortunately, the patient fell on a tile floor &amp; hit her head resulting in a 1.5 inch gash in the back of her head. When she went to the ER, it was determined that she now had vertigo (which she never had before) but obviously hard to tell if it was a side effect of the vaccine or from the fall. The events resulted to a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment for the events which included CT scan, ekg, chest X-ray, bloodwk (unknown results) and Epley maneuver. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a workplace clinic. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient is not pregnant. Outcome of the events was recovering.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the first of two cases.   A 69-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine), the first dose administered in the right arm on 14Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) and the second dose administered in the left arm on 03Apr2021 at 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737), both intramuscular as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure both diagnosed 5 years ago, GERD and hypercholesteremia, all ongoing. The patient was a former smoker but has been smoke-free for 15 years. Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR) taken for hypercholesterolaemia from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown) taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; metformin (manufacturer unknown) taken for diabetes from an unspecified start date and ongoing and omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing.  The patient did not have any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that she and her daughter had their second dose of the vaccine on 03Apr2021. The patient tested positive for Covid. The patient developed shortness of breath on Sunday, 11Apr2021, and ended up with a pulmonary embolism. The patient doesn&#39;t know if she was possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine with thousands of other people. At the time of the report, the patient was mostly resolved and they are all home. She became short of breath, had severe cough and headache and she went to the ER and on the CAT scan they discovered she had a small pulmonary emboli. She was hospitalized from 11Apr2021-12Apr2021. The patient was given Eliquis and monoclonal antibodies as treatment for the events. The patient stated that she will be on Eliquis for the next month because of the pulmonary embolism. The patient did not need any additional therapies for COVID-19. The patient did not have any pre-existing diseases that worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection. The outcome of the event &#39;tested positive for Covid/shortness of breath/severe cough/headache&#39; was not recovered while the outcome of the event pulmonary embolism was recovering. The relatedness of the suspect drug to the reactions  was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears reasonable that the suspect drug did not contribute to the development of the reported event pulmonary embolism, that most likely was related to the concurrent development of COVID-19.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

Medical history included breast cancer from 1988 to an unknown date , ovarian cancer from 2015 to an unknown date , she has had lymph nodes removed from her right arm &#34;30 years ago&#34; from 1988 to an unknown date, pass out from unknown date to unknown date. Concomitant medication included olaparib (LYNPARZA) taken for ovarian cancer from Feb2020 at 150mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 1-2 tablets at night by mouth.She says she is a little person and couldn&#39;t tolerate the side effects of that, so she varies how many she takes based on her side effects. She says she is supposed to take 300mg in the morning and 300mg at night. She says how she takes it is, she takes 150mg or one pill in the morning, then one or two at night depending on how she is doing. Historical vaccine information included BNT162B2 dose 1, lot no: EL9264, route left arm for Covid-19 immunisation. Past drug history included on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out. The patient reported approximately 15 hours after the shot, on 21Feb2021 she had muscle spasms almost to seizure amount of shaking, full body muscle spasms. She clarifies that her side effects didn&#39;t kick in until 02:30AM on 21Feb2021. She says at 07:00AM on 21Feb2021 she got up and went into the bathroom and passed out, and had a low blood sugar episode she supposed.  She crashed unconscious to the floor. She said that could be from the shot, but she is also a high risk patient, a cancer patient, and is on a maintenance chemo drug. She says on days of intravenous (IV) chemo when she was being highly treated in the past sometimes she would pass out, so she doesn&#39;t know if that was related to the COVID shot or not. No testing had been done on high risk patients, so she thought maybe this could be a good heads up for something someone else may experience. Her side effects were on and off for several hours, the shaking and spasms would subside and then start again. She says that they went away, and then she got up and passed out, and her foot was all messed up, she doesn&#39;t know what she did when she fell, but she had it checked and it was not broken, it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. She says she thinks she fell backwards, and she thinks she caught her foot under the vanity. On unknown date, she experienced bruising of foot, fatigue, foot was all messed up/it was all bruised and swollen, but it was not broken. She says this was her right foot. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 27Feb2021, she took the first vaccine. From that day, for 2 days, she had injection site pain. On 07Mar2021, she started having tiredness, headaches, chills, fever, felt nauseated, had a fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack, dizziness, weakness, felt sick, and difficulty breathing.

For fast heart beat that felt like her chest was full and thought she was having a heart attack event, it comes and goes, she had it yesterday (21Mar2021) but hasn&#39;t had it today (22Mar2021) but she doesn&#39;t know if it is gone. Her symptoms were usually in the morning when she first gets up. She has been to the emergency room (ER) on 07Mar2021 and on 13Mar2021 and they say that nothing is wrong. On 07Mar2021, they gave her an IV because they thought she was dehydrated. On 13Mar2021, she went back to another hospital ER. She felt worse and her son came and got her and took her to the ER. They did a whole workup MRI of her head, x rays, blood work and everything. They didn&#39;t know what was causing it because it had it been over a week since her vaccine and they sent her home. She has been laying down and staying hydrated. She couldn&#39;t hardly get up and they asked her what has she done different and the only thing different was the vaccine. Everything listed on the risk factors [side effects] is how she is feeling. She was not hospitalized, they gave her medicine and told her to stay hydrated and sent her home and was told to follow up with her physician. She finally got an appointment for tomorrow (23Mar2021) with her physician. She can&#39;t drive because of the dizziness. All of her tests came back normal. They said her blood pressure fluctuated on 2021 but that is normal.

A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),  via unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (at the age of 70 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included lung issues and allergic asthma. Family history included brothers and sisters who died of lung issues and third sibling sister died many years ago due to allergic asthma. The patient previously took flu vaccine for immunization and experienced severe pain throughout her whole body. On 15Mar2021, patient received the first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Later on, that day when she got home after receiving the vaccine, underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen, beneath this area was a red circle where blood clotted or something, she would get hot and cold and take her clothes off because she was sweating but did not have fever, there was pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow. She goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should. She also noted that her rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips and throat were red. She&#39;s been sick and just laying around, her eyes, under her nose and left elbow were red, had cramp in left arm where site of injection, and sharp pains were hitting her in her eye, thigh, chest, head, and the arm. Patient clarified that these symptoms began on 15Mar2021, the same day she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. On 23Mar2021, patient went to the ER and the findings were lower chest partial atelectasis or scarring in the lung bases bilateral and partial lung collapse (both upper and lower parts collapsed). At the hospital her temperature was 98.9 F on 23Mar2021, but 97.1F - 97.7F is her normal temperature. She went to the Pulmonary doctor also, but was getting a second opinion because she knew it could be life threatening. The pulmonary doctor made light of it saying they were just creases, like creases in pants. Patient said crease was a far cry from partial lung collapse on both bases and the Pulmonary doctor also said that it is in the upper part of the lung also. This scared her and made her think nobody cared. She did not know if she should provide the information because the doctor did not seem to believe that that her symptoms were coming from receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She guessed she should provide the information because Pfizer does research. She wanted to know how long do the side effects last and if she should take the second dose. The outcome of the events underneath the arm where the injection site was, a big red circle was noted and it was swollen/under her nose and left elbow were red, pain in her chest, stomach, back and head, wheezing, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling of the face, pain in left elbow, goes to bathroom and bowel was not emptying the way it should, rib cage is going on the side of body noticed this thumping, lips were red, throat was red, been sick and just laying around, eyes were red was not recovered; while unknown for the other events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He states that she complained of arm pain at the injection site that evening (4/14/21) and went to bed around 9:30pm because the pain was excruciating. He said around 2:00am, she woke up stating she couldn&#39;t breathe. This has happened before, so she went and sat up in the living room which helped her last time. For whatever reason, she then went into her bedroom where he said she fell out. He noticed foam coming from her mouth and called 911. EMS was unable to revive her. She passed away at home.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were provided. On 22Jan2021, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction. She went to the doctor and he was reluctant to give her steroids which was the normal way of treating the anaphylactic reactions because he said that the steroid would interfere with the effect of the vaccine. So, he gave her diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She had to go back to the emergency room later that day and they used epinephrine (EPIPEN) and she had to have an intravenous (IV) and other than that some medications, it had prednisolone in it. Then she had to go back yesterday and she had another IV and they sent her home with an EPIPEN. The event was assessed serious as medically significant. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; lot number: E18982), on 21Jan2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient reported that based on her history of reactions to medications, the nurses giving injections &#34;decided 0.2ml instead of 0.3ml&#34;, which is what they gave, so she got 0.2 that is two-third of the shot. The 2nd shot was for 8&#39;oclock on 11Feb2021. She is very sensitive to shots, vaccines, and to all medications and injections and things like that. She has sensitives thanks to two concussions she had in her life. She never was before that she had two concussions. Second one had a crazy man hit her after that just noticed that just have reactions not adverse or dying but definitely take rest of everything. So she take less of a shot, like a dental shot or cortisone shot, which she had taken in the past. If she has dental shot she cannot take Novocain, had to take Carbocaine or Marcaine and they give her half. Also she had been taking cortisone shot for shoulder for rotator cuff injury. They also have to give her less. Or flu shot: she takes half one week and come back for the other half the next week. Just have reactions. She told to when arrive for medication and did have one anaphylactic reaction but that was to cat skin dye, was told to this two nurses who was administering the vaccine and said to them she was really afraid to take. It is just too much for her. She knows her body. She is sure have reaction but is really afraid and don&#39;t know what is the first one will do to her. They just did two nurses and she decided that she will be taking  0.2 instead of 0.3ml which is what they gave. She got 0.2 so that two third of the shot and waited the half an hour, a nurse watched her card and 7 other cards. She did not have the anaphylactic reaction.  She went home. Her arm hurt and started to get little tired. The events started the day that she got the shot. Like about 3 or 4 hours later. It is just few hours later she couldn&#39;t watch TV so went to laid down and an hour later she woke-up. She walked to her kitchen and blood drained from her head, she just knew she was going to pass out. Her stomach suddenly did not feel well. She tried to get back her bed but she was round up and as far as the bathroom. She got very nauseous, she laid down on bathroom floor. She thought she was sick but didn&#39;t round up having to use toilet of few times. Although while she was feeling she would faint. She was very hot and so hot. While lie down, she couldn&#39;t even pulling off her pajamas. So when she got cold so she was pulling a towel down and stop and she laid to for two hours, she finally got to her bed. It was a terrible experience. Next day she drank water and had potatoes prepared and went up eating back to later baked potatoes. Next day luckily she did not have repeat of the nausea. She didn&#39;t have that anymore of. She did have abdominal issue just not diarrhea or anything but just not feeling well, feeling gassy, so uneasy. This all lasted, that part lasted for 7 days. What concerned her was especially beside first day it was few days she got off again. She was just feel blood drain but not this first time she laid on floor. She couldn&#39;t sit on chair to watch TV for about 3 days. She mostly laid on bed but she would get very hot and then very cold during the day. She would get very fast heart beat not continue but really fast like heart was pounding her chest. She felt like someone has their hand inside her body squeezing her chest. She got afraid but didn&#39;t want to go hospital. She didn&#39;t think she was sick enough. She was concerned. So that was happened and this last was for about 7 days. Then the squeezing of chest part went away. She doesn&#39;t want to wind-up on the floor feeling that sick again, she felt so sick it felt like food poisoning. After that, it was just being very hot, then being cold, the fast heart rate, every muscle hurting. Those were the main things that continued for a week. And digestive disorders. It all lasted for about 13 days. She was concerned she had a very fast heart rate intermediately for many days, for about a week. And that&#39;s considered an adverse reaction and also she was getting waves of feeling like she would pass out, everything would drain from her head. She experienced stomach ache, feeling hot then cold. She wants to do precautions before taking the second dose on 11Feb2021. She did take may be 3 days later two Tylenol but didn&#39;t take anything (clarification requested). She didn&#39;t even take vitamins during that time. She was afraid to take anything so she did not. At the same time also there was pain in her body in every muscles, fingers, hands, calves, feet, back, neck, everything. Her stomach abdomen was just tight. She was concerned that last for few days. In last few days she started feel herself and now she is going again tomorrow. So that how she reacted. She doesn&#39;t know how much of this shot she told them she could tolerate because everybody is saying second shot will give you more reactions. All she can take this more than that because that was lot. She wants to be herself, don&#39;t want laying on floor, don&#39;t want to have 105 temperature or anything. The patient was asking if she should take another 0.2ml another two-third of the shot. She just asked them for half that is 0.15 would that be a big difference. She needed to know by 8 o&#39;clock tomorrow. I might be in a queue to get it. She stated: &#39;So, that&#39;s my concern. I&#39;m all alone, I&#39;m a senior, I have no family. I lost my mother to covid. I know I need this vaccine, but I just, I cant get that sick and I&#39;m so afraid I&#39;ll wind up with a 105 something, fainting away and no one knowing&#39;. She was asking if reactions after the 2nd dose are worse than the 1st dose, if she didn&#39;t have anaphylaxis after 1st one, she shouldn&#39;t have it a 2nd time, right. She said, &#34;1st half of flu shot, I get sick, then the 2nd half nothing&#34;. She also asked if she can take medications after the vaccine, like Tylenol, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) medication she takes as needed. The events resolved, but the patient reported it took her like 13 days before she felt better.

                                                The patient initially presented (3/3/21) with headache, fevers, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgias, malaise. Patient related she was in her normal state of health and only started to feel poorly after she received her second COVID-19 vaccination three days earlier.  She interestingly related that after her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination she had significant burning in her stomach that she noted but no other major symptoms and notably did not experience this severe burning in her stomach after the second dose. She denied any chest pain, current dyspnea, productive cough, sore throat, urinary symptoms, sick contacts.  She has no history of C. difficile, no recent antibiotics, no recent spoiled foods, no recent travel, no history of radiation.  She does have a history of GERD and has had gastritis with mild gastrointestinal bleeding in the past and undergone EGD negative for H. pylori infection.  She also has undergone colonoscopies with polyps that have been removed and reported as tubular adenomas.  As her hospitalization progressed, she was diagnosed with Severe Sepsis due to E. Coli bacteremia in setting of liver abscess, Cholelithiasis without acute cholecystitis, Atrial Fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, Transaminitis (which resolved). Patient was appropriately treated for these conditions. Also, her known uncontrolled diabetes was treated. Per an Infection Disease note on 3/9/21: The patient has had hx of biliary colic (self diagnosis) now with discovery of non-obstructive cholelithiasis on RUQ US it is plausible that the abscess originated from self limiting cholecystitis/cholangitis which would be consistent with recent abdominal pain exacerbated with oral intake. Difficult to state definitively any relation to COVID-19 vaccination, though may have resulted from associated dehydration.

A 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Left on 23Mar2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730; Expiration Date: Jul2021) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included low magnesium, low vitamin D, allergy to Band-Aids, skin adhesives, and allergy to polyurethane spray tan (She&#39;s had a reaction to polyurethane on wood floors at her dad&#39;s house. Her throat started tightening and it was hard to breathe. She couldn&#39;t be in the house until they were finished with the floors. She had to stay in a hotel. She&#39;s also had a reaction to spray tan. After the spray tan was finished she had the tightness in her throat. She went to the emergency department and was given Benadryl and her reaction stopped after a short amount of time), She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; magnesium taken for low magnesium from an unspecified start date and ongoing; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) taken for vitamin D decreased, start and stop date were not reported. The patient had allergy to Polysporin (Johnson and Johnson NDC30036385, Lot#103812, Expiry Jan2020), Polysporin caused a bad skin reaction, it was awful. She can only use plain bacitracin. Some make ups she can&#39;t use. She&#39;s had no problems with creams. Foods are ok. She had a mole removed from her leg a couple years ago and she put the polysporin on the wound and that&#39;s when she had that reaction. It was bad around the incision, that wound took a long time to heal because of that sensitivity. She also can&#39;t take zinc oxide because it caused an allergic skin reaction, she also had allergy to Epinephrine, She had a reaction happen to her at the dentist. She was given epinephrine and her heart started pounding and racing. The dentist put her in a shock position. The dentist told her it would pass but it was scary. The patient previously also received Antihistamine for allergy. The patient experienced heart started pounding and racing (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, high blood pressure 220/118 (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, throat felt funny (medically significant) on 23Mar2021, allergic reaction/anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 23Mar2021. Events were considered as related to Covid 19 Vaccine by reporter. Event required a visit to Emergency Room. The clinical course as following: She received her first Covid 19 vaccine yesterday, on 23Mar2021. After she received the Covid 19 vaccine she walked down the hall to wait in the other room. When she sat down in the other room her heart started pounding and racing. The nurse took her pulse and took her blood pressure. The nurse asked her if she had high blood pressure and she does not have high blood pressure, she has low blood pressure. And the nurse told her that her pulse was fast. A second nurse came in to recheck her blood pressure and she got a high reading as well. The nurses called the nurse practitioner in also. The nurse practitioner said the caller should go to the emergency department. Her throat also felt funny but not bad. She has had reactions in the past when her throat got tight. In the emergency department she received 2 Benadryl, 50mg of Benadryl. They checked her out in the emergency department. The doctor checked her out. She was hooked up to monitor and she stayed for 4-5 hours in the emergency department in case there was a rebound effect. She was discharged from the emergency department. She reports her pulse was 118 beats per minute. She felt like it was higher than that. Her blood pressure was 220/118 the first time. She takes her blood pressure at home and it runs 118-120 over 68-72. The sensation after the Covid 19 vaccine was her heart started pounding. Her heart was moving she could see it pounding. She asked the emergency room doctor what does she do about the second Covid 19 vaccine. She is scheduled for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 15Apr2021. The doctor told her he wasn&#39;t sure about that. The doctor advised her to call the CDC and let them know what&#39;s going on. She did not speak to anyone at the CDC, she left her contact information for a call back. She found the number for Pfizer and called it. The symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours before the pulse came down to the 90&#39;s (beats per minute). The blood pressure came down quicker then the pulse did. Probably within the hour her blood pressure was down to 158 over something. In the emergency department she was instructed to take Benadryl 25mg every 6 hours for 24-48 hours. She&#39;s not back to her perky self, but her heart rate and blood pressure is normal. She took 25mg of Benadryl last night, 23Mar2021 then 25mg of Benadryl this morning, 24Mar2021. She&#39;s not taking it right at every 6 hours. And she&#39;ll take the Benadryl for only 24 hours. She reports it&#39;s unnerving for this to happen to her. It helped her that her blood pressure was coming down and they didn&#39;t have to give her any other medication besides the Benadryl. She felt like she was in a safe place in the emergency department. She kept drinking water the whole time, she likes to drink a lot of water and she also did some deep breathing exercises. She gets anxious when things like this happen to her. She felt this was medically significant because she didn&#39;t know what caused it. Is something in the vaccine that might have caused this to happen. When probing for relevant tests, she reports she had no tests done in the emergency department. They only maintained her on a heart rate monitor and took her blood pressure. She had no IV or anything like that. All the signs and symptoms of the anaphylactic reaction was described as high blood pressure, heart was racing, throat felt funny. Time of onset was minutes after receiving the vaccine, symptoms lasted about 1-2 hours. Patient require medical intervention included Antihistamine, Benadryl 50mg. Patient seen in the Emergency Department, she was monitored in the emergency department for about 4-5 hours on a heart rate monitor and had her blood pressure taken. The patient was not hospitalized. Organ involvement Cardiovascular: Hypertension 220/118, Tachycardia 118 beats per minute. The event was not required the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Patient&#39;s outcome following the potential anaphylactic reaction was Recovering. No laboratory tests or diagnostic studies performed. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for any other conditions prior to the event being reported. The patient did not receive any recent vaccines for SARS-CoV2 other than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prior to the event being reported. The patient hasn&#39;t received any other vaccines around the time of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported anaphylactic reaction described as high blood pressure, palpitation and oropharyngeal discomfort was likely causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.

She has scabs on her, blood was coming through, and slight bee stings all over and thigh on an unspecified date, she used hydrocortisone cream (treatment), she was lucky she have some of that here because she keep that when going or here but she rubbed that on last night and that was the only way that she was able to get some sleep. The patient doesn&#39;t think that she was going to get the second shot, she doesn&#39;t want to experience that again. It feels like that today it was not that bad itching today but at 71 that was miserable yesterday so probably she would not get the second shot. She hopes that the first one can protect her to a point, but she cannot subject herself to that again, that would be senseless for her to experience that again and get a second shot. The patient also stated that her eyelids have been a little itchy too so hopefully you all understand it was 71 years old was suffering from that kind of misery second time. The patient was unable to probe the more question, patient was in pain and not willing to proceed. The outcome of the events was unknown.

This case was received via Pfizer Inc (Reference number: 2021040024) on 18Jan2021 and was forwarded to BMS on 19Jan2021. This spontaneous case was reported by a consumer and describes the occurrence of AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (Hashimotos&#39; Disease), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease) and HAEMORRHAGE (she has a bleeding disorder/ a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding) in 72-year-old female patient who received apixaban (ELIQUIS) for an unknown indication. The occurrence of additional non-serious events is detailed below CO-SUSPECT PRODUCTS included COVID-19 VACCINE for an unknown indication. On an unknown date, the patient started ELIQUIS (unknown route) and COVID-19 VACCINE (Intramuscular). On an unknown date, the patient experienced AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS (seriousness criterion medically significant), MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE (seriousness criterion medically significant), HAEMORRHAGE (seriousness criterion medically significant), CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY (allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes) and DERMATITIS CONTACT (allergies to adhesive, and polymers). The action taken with ELIQUIS (Unknown) was unknown. At the time of the report, AUTOIMMUNE THYROIDITIS, MIXED CONNECTIVE TISSUE DISEASE, HAEMORRHAGE, CONTRAST MEDIA ALLERGY and DERMATITIS CONTACT outcome was unknown. Consumer reported that she had read the EUA Fact Sheet for Recipients and have some questions to the &#34;What should you mention to your vaccination provider&#34;. Caller mentioned that she has allergies (experienced rashes and hives) to contrast dyes, adhesive, and polymers such as the angio-seal that was used on her for a cardiac procedure in the groin to stop bleeding. She has irritation from the polymer and described it as a sponge that was meant to be absorbed for a month. Her first question was does the COVID-19 vaccine contain latex, mold (polymers) and adhesive? Response: For latex. For mold (polymer) and adhesive: &#34;A review of the ingredients list on the product label show that mold (polymer) and adhesive are not part of the formulation, however, Pfizer does not specifically manufacture the vaccine to be free of mold (polymer) and adhesive, therefore, we cannot assure that it was &#34;mold (polymer)-free and adhesive free&#34;. We cannot guarantee that minute amounts of substances are not contained in raw materials obtained from our suppliers. She had the PPSD23/Pneumonia 23 vaccine last 05Jan2021 and was told not to get the COVID-19 vaccine for 14 days. Is it because of the injection site or is it for systemic reasons? Consumer mentioned that she was on ELIQUIS. She has Hashimoto&#39;s Disease and Mixed Connective Tissue Autoimmune Disease. She said that she was not immunocompromised. She mentioned that she has a bleeding disorder. The Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine can only be administered as an intramuscular injection For ELIQUIS (Unknown), the reporter did not provide any causality assessments.   Reporter&#39;s causality assessment was not provided.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Causality assessment for ELIQUIS: Events: Hashimoto&#39;s disease, Contrast media allergy, Topical adhesive allergy, Mixed connective tissue disease were considered unrelated while bleeding was considered related.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: BMS Medical Evaluation Comment: This patient had autoimmune thyroiditis, mixed connective tissue disease and hemorrhage after receiving apixaban therapy. This patient also had COVID-19 vaccination. Based on the anticoagulant action of apixaban, its role in the event hemorrhage is considered as possible. Based on the etiology of the reported events, auto immune thyroiditis and mixed connective tissue disorder are considered not related to apixaban.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9262, expiration date 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at left upper arm around 19:00 or a little later at single dose (at the age of 72-years-old) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included bad knees and got injections for this and recurrent cellulitis of legs (cellulitis was not active at time of vaccine; but anytime her leg swells with bad knees she had a little episode with the cellulitis down around her ankles on both legs but left leg was more predominant. She had been keeping it at bay), mineral supplementation, bad knee pain, blood pressure medication (abnormal), urine output control (abnormal), dehydrated and dizzy. Concomitant medication included lisinopril as blood pressure medication, potassium for Mineral supplement, solifenacin succinate for urine output control, paracetamol (TYLENOL 4) for bad knee pain. She had taken potassium before and it calmed it down: she was little dehydrated, little dizzy, so was drinking some Pedialyte, water, and taking potassium. The patient had it once before but it kind of snuck up on her again. The patient called to ask if anyone had reported any type of blood clot on the same side of the body that the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was administered. She questioned if she might have a blood clot in her left leg after having been administered the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She had recurrent cellulitis in both legs prior to Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. The doctor thought the cellulitis in left leg may be acting up and that she might have an infection in that area of cellulitis. She reported pain in the left leg when she rested her leg on a pillow; but did not feel any pain when she was standing and walking. The pain became a little too hard for her to bear so the doctor prescribed her Cephalexin 500m capsule every 12 hours-she was on the 3rd capsule now. Onset date for the events was approximately 03Feb2021 or 04Feb2021. The events were better since started Cephalexin. Second dose date scheduled for 22Feb2021 but did not give her time. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow-up (23Feb2021): New information received from the product quality complaint group includes confirmation of lot number (EL9262) and new expiry date.

The reported events likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including Head CT/MRI,  EEG,  counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                the problem was a bloodclot; slight swelling of right foot; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 72-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 13:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure and allergy to tape. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; olmesartan; metformin; all were taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks prior to BNT162b2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 13Mar2021 15:00, the patient noticed slight swelling of right foot and on 14Mar2021, the swelling increased so the patient texted the nurse who arranged appointment. The nurse said to contact the doctor and the patient spoke with registered nurse (RN) on duty who told the patient to go to the emergency room (ER) because the symptoms indicated the problem was a blood clot. The ER doctor examined and ordered an ultrasound and the results confirmed blood clot. The patient was given a prescription for blood thinner to take for 21 days (times/day, 15mg) and was told to make an appointment with the primary doctor. The patient&#39;s doctor was on spring break and she was walked in to see another doctor who said swelling looked improved and showed her where the clots were located. The patient saw her primary doctor today and she ordered a visit with a hematologist as soon as possible (ASAP) because of concerns about possible underlying issues. The outcome of events, slight swelling of right foot and the problem was a blood clot was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Patient with Hx of AML received 1st dose COVID vaccine 2/10/2021, 2nd dose 3/4/2021.  She developed DVT of the right leg, AML relapse. The patient has been diagnosed with AML back in 2016 and underwent several lines of therapy including chemotherapy with 7 and 3 and the last treatment was decitabine with maintenance treatment with ivosidenib.  Having severe leukocytosis and right-sided leg edema with DVT raised concern about  blast crisis and leukostasis. Patient was admitted to hospital and received. ceftriaxone and azithromycin for possible pneumonia.  She underwent leukophoresis on the 4/6/2021, 4/7/2021. Patient received IV heparin gtt for DVT but later on was on hold given worsening thrombocytopenia. She was transferred from one hospital to another hospital.  I do not think the development of DVT was due to COVID vaccine. But prior to COVID vaccine, patient was in AML remission.

She said her lightheadedness, and equilibrium being off was still going on. Reported she hurt more, too, in her L4 &amp; L5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body. She clarified she fractured her back (specifically her L4 vertebrae) last summer (2020), and her L4 vertebrae had since healed. She said she had a pinched sciatic nerve since Feb2020. She clarified her L4 and L5 vertebrae move because she had 3 blood patches to treat her spinal cord leaks. She said when the blood patches were done a lot of force was used to stop the spinal leaks. She said the first blood patch caused her buttocks to really hurt. She said she had 2 more blood patches. She said she was not too sure about second blood patch, but with the 3rd blood patch, she was miserable. She said she had physical therapy weekly, and she may have to have her back fused. She said she had a bone density issue that apparently was mentioned in her medical records when she was in her 50s. She said she was never treated for her bone density issue until after she fractured her L4 vertebrae in 2020. No further details provided. Reported her last blood work was 3-4 months ago. No further details provided. Reported her Oral Lichen Planus was more pronounced since her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose (Mar2021). She clarified she started to get Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores a couple days after she received her second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she can go months without having any issues, and then get the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores. She said she took medication to manage her Oral Lichen Planus. She said with the medication, the Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores are gone within 24-48 hours. She said with her latest Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores, she put her medication on the mouth sores, and the mouth sores seemed to settle down, but the mouth sores didn&#39;t go away completely. She said the day before yesterday (03Apr2021), her Oral Lichen Planus mouth sores got worse again, and are staying that way, even with using the medication. Oral Lichen Planus Treatment: Stated she was applying Clobetasol Propionate Ointment UPS 0.05% to her mouth sores after she eats, or about 3-4 times a day. NDC Number: 51672-1259-6, Lot Number: 332450, Expiration Date: Aug2021. For other treatment she had medication she takes every day, and she continued to take the medication to help her symptoms. She said she had physical therapy twice a week for about 1-1/2 hours, as well as, doing physical therapy on her own. She clarified she does the physical therapy for her sciatica and vestibular issues, saying she was not steady on your feet. She said she does physical therapy about 4 hours a week. Reported her doctors told her she would not survive the Corona Virus if she were to get it because of her underlying health issues. No further details provided. Reported her doctors said there was no information reporting that the COVID-19 Vaccine was contraindicated in people with spinal cord leaks, and how the COVID-19 Vaccine would affect people with spinal cord leaks. She said she thought she may have been fighting things because the COVID-19 Vaccine was acting like the flu vaccine (when she first developed Oral Lichen Planus). She said she thought her symptoms after her second COVID-19 Vaccine dose  may have had something to do with her spinal cord leak because she had similar symptoms (lightheadedness &amp; equilibrium issues) with her spinal cord leak. She said with her spinal cord leak, she also had pain and loses her voice. No further details provided. The outcome of the events she just sat down in a chair, and everything went black for a second was recovered on 25Mar2021; headache was recovered in Mar2021; chills was recovered in Mar2021; not feeling well was recovered in Mar2021; body was aching/she hurt more, too, in her l4 &amp; l5 vertebrae, and had pain throughout her whole body was recovered in Mar2021; loses her voice was unknown; while for other events was not recovered.

It was sky high. 210/180 They took it a couple of times and even changed machines.  Then the took me in a wheelchair to the ER. On the way I could not answer some questions  or my answers were slow. According to my husband I slumped a bit. And answered questions in my native tongue. In the room they did all kinds of  tests.  BP was still high, but came down . After a few hours my ?fog? in my head cleared and I felt ? normal ? again.  They let me go around 11 pm. The doctor said it was NOT the vaccine, but I disagree with her. I felt good till I got the shot. She says I had a syncope vasovagal. But that occurs with low BP. I had high BP.

On Jan 29th,   I woke up to stabbing pains in my right chest which continued to night of Jan 30th.  Morning of Jan 31st, I was very short of breath and could hardly get around.  I went to the ER in evening of Jan 31st.  I was admitted due to two pulmonary embolisms in my lungs.  Doctors were convinced I had Covid 19.   However, three tests came up negative.  I was put on a Heparin drip and then eventually on Eliquis.  I have always been healthy up to this point and never had any clotting issues.  I now am on Eliquis for at least six months (have to have a follow-on echocardiogram due to issues on right side of my heart.).  I am convinced the vaccine triggered the clots.

                                                On Feb. 12th at 2PM symptoms started with lower back pain, pain in abdomen and stomach, cramping, chills, ear ache, pain level 8.  Felt sick all over, like having the flu and then whole body ached, not just GI track.  Left arm injection site was red, sore to touch, swollen (slightly).  Doctor couldn&#39;t get vaccination needle into arm muscle the first time and so had to try a second time.   Intense cramping of GI track started up again 8:45AM on Feb. 13th.   By 4PM Feb. 15th fever 102F, chills, felt freezing cold and had to wrap myself in a heating blanket.  Pain level 10, especially in pancreas. Fever broke around 2:30AM Feb. 16th and later when I was up at 8AM I felt very weak, faint, pancreas ached.  Pancreatic pain lasted another 3 days.  Pancreatic pain stayed around level 5.  On Feb. 17th took ibuprophen.  Pain level reduced to 1.   This was the only time that I took pain medication between Feb. 10th and 17th, because I am conservative about using Ibuprophen, Tylenol, and have a high threshold for pain.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 EUA Vaccine  Pt received first COVID vaccine 2/25/21. Tested positive for COVID late February. Reported to ED 3/5/21 with near syncope. Patient was seen emergency department laying in bed. The patient had a noticeable scalp laceration to posterior parietal area.  After being symptomatic with COVID-19 for a few days, the patient reports getting up at 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom, feeling lightheaded, then ended up on the floor, she reports sitting on the floor and then hit her head at some point, but was not entirely sure of this timeline.  She states she ended up moving to the living room when she noticed that her head was bleeding a lot and her fiance called 911. She reports a history of syncopal episode in 2001 when she had influenza and apparently the story was much the same as this time, but she actually lost consciousness in 2001. Admitted to observation.    3/7: 73-year-old female recent COVID-19 infection admitted on 03/05/2021 for an episode of syncope probably secondary to bradycardia versus volume depletion.  Paramedic on arrival at home reported bradycardia with heart rate in the 30s but has been normal since admission. The CT angiogram of the chest done at the emergency room showed bilateral infiltrates compatible with recent COVID-19 infection.  No PE.  However patient has no respiratory symptoms and O2 saturation is perfectly normal.  Urinalysis was suggestive of infection and subsequent culture was positive for E coli and it is pansensitive.    She was admitted to hospital for overnight observation.  She was commenced on IV Rocephin and azithromycin.  The EP cardiologist was consulted and she recommended and echocardiogram and it revealed mild global hypokinesis with LVEF of 45-50% but patient denied any prior history of cardiac problem.   On re-evaluation this morning the vital signs remains normal.  Patient has not had any episode of bradycardia since she presented to the emergency room.  She will be discharged home follow up with the EP cardiologist for further evaluation. Patient does not need outpatient oral antibiotics as IV Rocephin for 3 days should be adequate for uncomplicated UTI.

A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6207, expiry date: Jul2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19Mar2021 10:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes from Jun2001 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included metformin taken for diabetes from Jun2001 and ongoing. The patient previously received flu shot from immunization (she had the flu shot 20 years ago had bad reaction to). Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the hospital. The vaccine was not administered at military facility. The patient received the vaccine on 19Mar2021 and she felt fine that Friday. On 20Mar2021 (Saturday), she started having a bad headache and took Aleve. She took Aleve 3 times 4 hours apart because she still had a bad headache. She started losing the ability to bring out words. She stated that her headache was gone. On 21Mar2021 (around 4 o clock), her husband was in the kitchen and asked her a question but could not understand her and asked again. She could not say the words but she could spell them. Her husband asked her another question, she tried to talk but she could not answer back. At that point her husband said they were going to the hospital. She was admitted for 3 days from 21Mar2021 to 23Mar2021. The doctor told her she was having a migraine because it had lasted for 2 days. She also spoke with her primary care provider, who looked it up and said this could be a side effect. She was told the migraine may take away the ability to talk. Her headache has been gone but continues to feel very tired (extremely tired since 19Mar2021). Her symptoms came out as if she was having a stroke on an unspecified date. The event &#39;could not understand words but could not answer back&#39; required an emergency room visit.The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CAT scan, MRI, and contrast test, all with negative result on 22Mar2021. The outcome of the event &#39;could understand words but could not answer back&#39; was recovered on 22Mar2021, the event &#39;bad headache/migraine&#39; was recovered on 21Mar2021, not recovered for extremely tired, and unknown for the event &#39;stroke&#39;.

She underwent R foot debridement and amputation on 4/16/2021. ID team treated with Vanco/Cefepime. On 4/18 afternoon, she developed PEA and coded for about 25min. Since ROSC, she never regained consciousness. This morning, at the beginning of my shift at 7am, she&#39;s on bicarb drip, maxed Levophed 100, Epi 100 drips and full vent. However, she was getting paced and BP stayed in 40s. I discussed with ICU pharmacist and gave her stress dose Solu-cortef. Checked serum cortisol level, turned out to be appropriate later. Lactic acid 22 and bicarb was only 2 despite being on Bicarb drip. I called Shauna/daughter to  inform her about guarded prognosis (imminent death) and asked to bring husband to come see her asap. Before family arrived, she developed another PEA and code blue was called. She was given Epi, bicarb pushes and CPR started immediately. Code blue was unsuccessful. At 8:13am, she was pronounced dead. I called daughter again to notify her of patient&#39;s death. Family arrived around 10am. I met both daughter and husband at bedside and offered emotional support. Chaplain was consulted.

                                                had a stroke; instantly had a pounding headache; blood pressure was elevated; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 73-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 25Mar2021, she received the first COVID-19 vaccine and instantly had a pounding headache.  She went to her doctor who said her blood pressure was elevated and was going to do more testing. She and her sister went away thinking she just needed to relax but then had a stroke in the hotel that same day and was in the hospital for 3 days (until 28Mar2021). She has never had high blood pressure and no history of headaches.  The doctor in the hospital thought that this could be related to the vaccine since she had no high blood pressure or headaches before.  She asked the doctors if she should get the second one and they all said they don&#39;t know enough about the vaccine to give her guidance. Outcome of the events were unknown.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                My mom only had site soreness after her covid vaccine on 1/21 which resolved within a couple days. However, she died in the early morning hours of 1/25, she was fine the day before, no sign of injury.  We found her collapsed on the ground and although we tried cpr she was already dead.  She had gone to the hospital on 12/28 for shortness of breath, angina and symptomatic anemia, her ekg was unchanged and blood work normal except for anemia. The cardiologist did not think a cardiac cath was needed. Her shortness of breath improved with a blood transfusion and a dose of lasix (no heart failure).

                                                a little tired; passed out; weakness; disorientation when walking; headache; nausea; hand  on the side that she got the vaccine was cold; Second dose: pain at injection site; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 74-years-old female patient received BNT162B2, dose 2, via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 AM (Lot Number: EN6204; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history included eczema from 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms and had mild allergies to mold and juniper. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 74-year-old on 23Feb2021 at 10:00AM (lot number: EN6198, Expiry: Jun2021) intramuscular injection in left arm and experienced pain at injection site and couldn&#39;t sleep. The patient also took Prolia shots for arthritis. The patient experienced headache, nausea, pain at injection site and hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold on 16Mar2021, passed out, weakness and disorientation when walking on 17Mar2021, a little tired on 18Mar2021. The clinical course included: The patient was calling about the second vaccine that she got on 16Mar2021 (Tuesday). She was calling about the after effects. They were quite huge. She had a headache, nausea, weakness, and disorientation when walking. Stated she obviously had pain at the site of injection. Stated some of it was her own fault, and at first she felt fine. On the same day that she got her second dose of the covid vaccine, she had a glass of wine and was not too hungry. She ate a little that evening. The next morning she passed out. Clarified that she had two glasses of wine, not one. Caller&#39;s daughter was a doctor. Caller referd to her daughter as doctor daughter. Stated that she told her daughter about what happened. Her daughter told her it was because she was dehydrated. Her daughter told her that it was called vagus something or another. Her daughter was not there with the caller. Her daughter called it vagus something, she does not remember. Her daughter told her that it had to do with inflammation and her immune system. Caller stated she also has arthritis. Her daughter told her that she was stupid for drinking wine after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine and not eating a full meal. Whenever she passed out and fell, she did not hurt herself but it was a wake up call. She realized she was vulnerable. She was calling because she did not know why no one told her to drink a lot of water after receiving the vaccine. She got a Prolia shot in July and the nurses told her to drink a lot of water. She was asking why the nurses who gave her the covid vaccine are not saying that to people. Her daughter told her to call the doctors office about this, and she told her daughter that it was over with now, she&#39;s 95%, she was a little tired on 18Mar2021. She was unconscious for 15 seconds per her husband. Her husband was shouting her name, and she did not hear anything. She wanted to call and report that the nurses should tell people to drink water. One more thing, her daughter told her that the covid vaccine was slowly released. About 10 hours after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold. She got the vaccine about 10AM, and about 10PM at night is whenever her hand got cold. She had pain at the injection site where she had the first dose of the vaccine too. She had more pain at injection site after the second dose of the vaccine. It was not awful, but only if she pressed on it. Clarified that she gets Prolia shots twice a year for her arthritis. Luckily whenever she started to get dizzy, she braced her self, whenever she fell, she did not fall from an upright position. She was crouched over, and fell against trays that fell with her. Her doctor daughter told her that inflammation was because of her immune system. One other thing was that she has been stung in the past and had extreme reactions from yellow jackets in the 90&#39;s. She thought her immune system was sensitive. One other things related to her autoimmune from 3 years ago. She moved to a city in 2012. Everyone told her after 5 years she would develop allergies. In 2017, she had eczema all over her back and arms. It was not just like a topical thing where she scratched and itched, it was under her skin. She went to a dermatologist and he took a biopsy, but the results just said eczema. She went to an allergist, he finally found a space on her underarms where he could do a test. The test showed that she had mild allergies to mold and juniper. Juniper is a tree that they have there, she has one in her back yard. Her allergy was very mild. She tried everything, and in 4 months it went away. Now she just latherers her skin with coconut oil. Her diagnosis that this autoimmune issue was related her immune response from the yellow jacket reaction is a self diagnosis. A doctor had never told her this, this was coming from her own self. Clarified that she is calling about the second dose of the pfizer covid 19 vaccine. Headache: It was not a bad headache, it was more like pressure all across the top. Whenever she went to sleep, the headache started. She got the second dose of the covid vaccine on 16Mar2021. She had a little bit of a headache this morning. A cup of coffee with milk made it better. Nausea: It started whenever she did not want to eat dinner. She could tell her stomach was not right. The nausea and headache started together about 12 hours after her vaccine at 10:00 PM. Weakness: She noticed weakness on the next day whenever she got up to use the bathroom. Clarified as the early morning of 17Mar2021. Her weakness was about 90 percent resolved. Disorientation when walking: Clarified that her disorientation was in reference to walking only right before she fell. She was not mentally disoriented. Mentally she knew that she was not doing well. Second dose: pain at injection site: The pain only lasted for about 2-3 hours. It was now absolutely minimal. She would have to press on it to feel anything. Her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold: She got the second dose of the covid vaccine around 10:00 AM, and noticed her hand was cold about 5:00 PM., about 7-8 hours later. Whenever she went to bed, she was cold. She thought that it resolved by the next morning. The morning after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine, she passed out: She passed out about 8:15 AM. The outcome of the events headache, nausea, weakness, pain at injection site was recovering. The outcome of the events disorientation when walking and her hand on the side that she got the vaccine was cold was recovered on 17Mar2021. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                She had diareah and nausea for a few days with 1st shot but it got better. She complained about &#34;feeling off&#34; after the 2nd shot. Went to bed to try to sleep it off and she never got up again.  We think she died Wednesday night or Thursday morning by how she stopped responding to texts. She was found deceased on Friday.  They won&#39;t do an autopsy here.  funeral home has her for now.

                                                I woke up feeling sick with headache and pain in abdomen, went to bathroom and sat down, I was burning up and perspiration was dripping down my body, i felt like i might throw up and that was the last though until I came to on the floor of our walk in shower.  It took me a while to orient myself and get up and sat down again on toilet still with pain in head and disoriented. next thing i know i am coming to wedged between the toilet tank and the vanity.  I managed to get back on the toilet and sat there wondering what was happening to me.  I could tell i was getting better so i just sat there a while longer until i though my legs would hold me so i could get back to the bed.  I laid in bed the rest of the night unable to sleep with headache and shivering with being cold even under my blankets. I stayed in bed Saturday then called the doctor first thing Monday morning. I got in to see her at 10:30 Monday morning.  She ordered a full blood panel and urinalysis and heart monitor for 48 hours.  The blood panel and urinalysis reports are all ok.  Have not received report yet from the heart monitor.  Doc said I cannot take the second shot.

It was noted that patient has had intermittent syncope since August of 2020 and clinical interpretation is likely that pericardial effusion pre dated vaccination.  In her workup for dizziness and syncope she had not previously undergone EKG, chest x-ray or echocardiogram therefore pericardial effusion could have been missed.  I elected to report the  pericardial effusion to be on the side of caution.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-02), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper forearm on 01Mar2021 at the age of 75-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered to the patient at a pharmacy (in a grocery store). The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The patient&#39;s medical history included retired (retired registered nurse), ongoing depression (has had this condition for probably 20 years), ongoing lung cancer (has had this condition for probably 3 years), ongoing bipolar (has had this condition for about 4 years), ongoing emphysema (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years), and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (has been severe for about 4 or 5 years). Concomitant medications included duloxetine taken for depression from an unspecified start date and ongoing (been taking this probably for 15 years); and arformoterol tartrate (BROVANA) (started taking this probably 5 years ago), budesonide (started taking this probably 5 years ago), tiotropium bromide (SPIRIVA) (has been taking this for probably about 4-5 years), oxygen (has been using this full time for 3 years), and Trilogy machine (she sleeps with this, it is an invasive intubation. She puts a big mask on and it pumps air in, pulls air out, letting her lungs rest. Her oxygen hooks up to it), all taken for emphysema and COPD from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient reported that she received the vaccine on 01Mar2021 and sometime in Apr2021 around Easter, she went to the hospital for COPD exacerbation, tiredness and weakness. The patient required a visit to the emergency room due to the events and reported that she went by ambulance to the hospital. The patient stated that she has these events often and it has nothing to do with the COVID vaccine. She went to the hospital with exacerbation of COPD and missed her date to get her last shot. She wanted to know whether she can get the 2nd dose of the vaccine with her experience after the 1st dose. The patient reported that she now weighs 177 after she has been pumped full of cortisone. The patient reported that her lung doctor was really the one that manages her medical. The patient reported that she thinks she came home from the hospital the day before Easter and she was in the hospital for 5 days (in Apr2021). She was sick before that, at home, and she finally had to call # to come and get her. She believes she had to call # the 5th day before Easter, but she was not positive. When asked to clarify what she meant by sick, the patient explained she was extremely tired, she couldn&#39;t get out of bed and couldn&#39;t move. She was having trouble breathing. She was on oxygen 24/7 and sleeps with a trilogy machine so she was having a lot of trouble, it was awful. She said she then found out at the hospital her red blood cell was below 5 and her iron was critically low. They had to give her 2 units of blood and an infusion. Then she went back yesterday and got another infusion and she has to go back next week for another infusion. The patient confirmed that she was hospitalized for COPD. She then stated she didn&#39;t know the exact date of when she was discharged from the hospital, but she was thinking it was the day she was scheduled for her second shot. She then clarified she came home Easter. The patient reported that she can&#39;t do much without having to sit down, catch her breath, and rest a little bit. She was improving but not as fast as she&#39;d like to. While reading the vaccine record card, the patient stated &#34;my eyes aren&#39;t as good as they used to be&#34;. Her pulmonologist stated she was going to die if she doesn&#39;t take the vaccine. If she catches COVID she was not going to make it, so her pulmonologist thinks her chances are better with the vaccine than without it. The patient said she goes all the time to the hospital; therefore, she doesn&#39;t think the events were related to the vaccine. She had been sick several times. They can&#39;t do anything about the bleeding, they can&#39;t go in to do anything because of her lungs, her lungs were so bad. No further details were provided regarding the bleeding she was speaking of.

A 75-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 10:45 (at 75 years old, not pregnant), single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Type II diabetes, Hypertension, GERD and hypercholesterilymia, sulfa allergy, all from an unknown date. Concomitant medications included verapamil; rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR); metformin; omeprazole, unspecified blood thinners. The patient previously took tetracycline for known allergies: Tethracycline. Patient experienced abnormal nose bleed with blood cloths the first day (reported as 30Mar2021 0130). Five days later in two days had 6 more nose bleed that it was taking me to control up to 30 min. She went to ER in the morning and had a CBC having results normal with normal levels of platelets. She was referred to PCP. She saw a NP next day and gave me referral to ENT specialist. Using an scope could not find anything and ordered to have CT Scan. Results show negative for polips, tumors and show only a shadow by eye socket which MD believe it was an infection that was leading to the bleed. Prescribe a very small amount of Amoxicilline 125 mg, twice a day for 7 days plus a saline gel. Patient had the last nose bleed at midnight. For 3 days did not have any bleeding until today, at 10:15 am, with heavy bleeding which took me 15 min. to control. She has no history of nose bleed, taking blood thinners, no head traumas either. No other vaccine in four weeks. No Covid prior vaccination. No Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event infection was unknown, other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Information provided was so limited to prevent a meaningful and definite medical assessment for the events. A causal relationship cannot be completely excluded for BNT162B2 injection and development of Thrombosis and Epistaxis, only based on a plausible chronological sequence.
