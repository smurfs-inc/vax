A 76-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number EL3247), intramuscular on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included COVID symptoms from 16Jan2021 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient with acute resp failure, COVID pneumonia, that developed symptoms 9 days prior to admit and ultimately received first vaccine 6 days prior to a admit, then shortly after progressed with other covid symptoms and was admitted on 25Jan2021. She decompensated while intp and was transferred to ICU for rising O2 needs, ultimately had to be intubated. Became hypotensive due to massive hamatoma 2&#39; bleeding into abd rectus muscle. Sx and IR consulted and did beside exploration of hematoma. Initially blood pressure responded but overnight continued with refractory hypotension. Maxed out vasopressin and levophed, hemodynamics deteriorated. The patient died on 02Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events death, COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal wall haematoma and abdominal wall haemorrhage cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pt passed soon after

                                                DEATH-My Mother received her second Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, February 18, 2021 and died three days later on Sunday, February 21, 2021, after being admitted to the intensive care unit at  Hospital.  After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.  Instead of the massive all call for vaccinations, we need further information and data from additional studies that will give more insight as to when the vaccine can cause more harm than good, as in My Mother?s case.

This consumer reported for a 76-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) who received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL3302) first dose via unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at 12:00 PM in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 Immunization in the hospital. There was no other vaccine administered in four weeks. Medical history included COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), Small Cell Lung Carcinoma with metastases to brain s/p surgery, chemotherapy and radiation in 2014, dementia. Concomitant medications included citalopram at 40mg, levothyroxine at 0.05 mg, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). The patient previously took Codeine and experienced allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had what appeared to be a stroke on Saturday, 23Jan2021 at 12:00 PM. A CT, MRI and an Echocardiogram were all performed on 23Jan2021 and there was no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. Extensive FLAIR hyperintense signal signal in the cerebral white matter. Mild hyperintense signal in the brain stem and medial cerebellum. Following contrast administration there is no abnormal CNS enhancement. The adverse events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization for seven days from Jan2021. Treatment given was TPA to reverse adverse effects. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of events was recovered/resolved with sequel.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                is here today for ED follow-up on A-fib. Patient stated she is not taking Eliquis.    She had no side effects from her first COVID-19 vaccine. After the 2nd one she had muscle aches, headache, freezing cold, and &#34;weird&#34;, and felt really badly then at 9:30 PM, 32 hrs after the 2nd vaccine dose she felt the a-fib started. She had not been in a-fib in many years. Cardiology had already recommended eliquis but she was holding off. She had diltiazem from 2017 that she tried but with out relief. They rate controlled her but she remained in a-fib, started eliquis, and she went home. For 2.5 weeks she had headache and chest pain, other muscle pain, felt horrible, until she stopped the Eliquis.  Since stopping the Eliquis, she still has occasional mild chest pain, and headache, and flushing.   Her current chest pain is left chest, not radiating. The quality varies, stabbing pain in a very small location at times, may be associated with eating.   She did have a stress test years ago and was &#34;fine&#34;.   She had a dental appointment planned that she had to cancel, she has moved it to May 4th.

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

This is not about that but a week ago I began experiencing sharp pain in my thumbs when I tried to open a jar, pull up my pants, rub my hands together, flush the commode, etc.  I have never had this kind of pain before. I looked on the internet to see what might help and noticed that the pain could possibly be a reaction to the Covid vaccine.  Therefore, I am reporting it to you.

                                                About a week after the vaccine, I started to notice a subtle difference in my heart beat.  At night, I could feel my heart beat was a little off. I went to the doctor for something unrelated and was place on EKG that&#39;s how the doctor detected my arrythmia.  He said I had A-fib and sent me to the ER.   The ER confirmed my A-fib with an EKG and prescribed Eliquis, furosemide and potassium.  A few days after discharge, I had chest heaviness and couldn&#39;t breath.  I went to the ER.  They did an EKG, CAT scan, blood work  which also confirmed A-fib and build up of fluid around my heart, lungs and abdomen.  I followed up with a cardiologist office and was to continue with the medications at discharge.    I am being followed with a cardiolgist.  Since then, my heart rythm is back to normal from what I can tell.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick.

She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

Medical history included ongoing irritable bowel syndrome for over 50 years; high level of hormones; was losing hair; and had rectal bleeding from Jan2021 to an unspecified date. Concomitant medication included ongoing spironolactone from Jan2021. On 01Mar2021, the patient did not have blood on the toilet paper, no rectal bleeding, and had volumes of regular stool, and mentioned that there may be something in the vaccine that helped her irritable bowel syndrome; and had aching arm. On 02Mar2021, the patient was bleeding; had blood in her stools; and had volumes of regular stool, and went to the bathroom 20 times. The patient did not receive any treatment for the reported events. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient had received the second dose of vaccination on 28Mar2021.

The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

The patient medical history included temperamental immune system (she is extremely sensitive. She reacts to everything). The concomitant medications were not reported.  on an unspecified the patient experienced atrial fibrillation (AFIB), tachycardia, chills, lethargy, brain fog, felt like i had a cold spent 2 days feeling like that, hypersensitivity. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of AFIB, tachycardia. The  outcome of events was unknown.   The course of events was as follows: On an unspecified she had reacted to the first vaccine: the first day she was fine. The next day she had chills, lethargy, kind a brain fog, felt like she had a cold and spent 2 days feeling like that. On Day 3 she had AFIB and tachycardia for 3-4 days saw the heart doctor and got medicine for that. She had a temperamental immune system. The stress test was super important. She was wandering if she had the Pfizer vaccine a week after the stress test. She got it at the university, and she wandered if they were restricted to give it to her a few days after my scheduled date: They wanted to rule out blockage in her heart.  She was having a test done around the same time as the 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She wanted to know if she could get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine later/ a week after the stress test. She wanted the vaccine, it was important. On 04May21 she was going to have a dye based test checking your heart, a stress test. The stress test was scheduled the same morning as her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She was advised to consult with your doctor or pharmacist for further guidance.

                                                major bleed; GI bleed; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 77-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) (Lot Number: EN6200) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included first time she experienced bleeding was in 2013 because of aspirin. Stated that she decided it was a good idea to take baby aspirin so she took it on her own. She was told don&#39;t ever take aspirin ever again and she didn&#39;t have any problem until Nov2020. That was the first incident, in 2013, that told her she should not take blood thinner. They took her off the blood thinner in Nov2020. She had been taking aspirin. She lost half her blood; she lost it two settings. She sat down to take a bowel movement and was told she lost half of her blood. Not sure when she started Aspirin but she stopped it in 2013. It was mentioned that she could take aspirin. She was on a low dose of Eliquis for atrial fibrillation for prevention of a blood clots or heart attack.  she had bleeding in the last year. The one that was the most was back in Nov2020; it was more pronounced. Mentioned that she went in on 12Nov2020 for the bleeding and then had to go back in because her legs were swelling. She stopped taking Eliquis in Nov2020 and from then until Apr2021 she had no bleeding. It was several years ago when she was diagnosed. She was riding her bike in the neighborhood, and felt too tired so she stopped at the doctor and went in and told them she felt weird, they couldn&#39;t get her BP and took her to the hospital and her heart rate was sky high like 250. They said she might had to have electric. She didn&#39;t have any pain but states she was psychologically freaked out by everyone running around. Mentioned that, she was first placed on dronedarone (MULTAQ) 400mg twice daily to treat her atrial fibrillation; she can&#39;t remember the year. After taking it as prescribed for some time she got atrial fibrillation again. She was told by the doctor it had lost its efficacy. Concomitant medications included Fenofibrate taken for blood cholesterol, Metoprolol succinate taken for blood pressure, Vitamins NOS, Ferrous Sulfate taken for anemia, Vitamin D3 all are ongoing. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3246) on 06Feb2021 in arm left for covid-19 immunization. It was reported that, On 25Feb2021 she received her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech Covid-19 vaccine, on 19Apr2021 she had a major bleed and GI bleed (Hospitalization) on 19Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for major bleed and GI bleed from 19Apr2021 to 21Apr2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No further information expected.

She tried to take off her sweatshirt and her arm froze--this is the last thing she remembers.  Husband called 911 and she went to the ER.  She had had a seizure and they found 2  brain lesions. She had a CT scan and an MRI in the ER.   There was memory loss in the beginning and slurring of words.  She felt a weighty fatigue.  Was put on Keppra for seizures.  Had consults with neurology, a neurosurgeon, a neuro-oncologist--all unsure of what exactly these brain lesions were.   Back left lower part of brain:  a small lesion, which was basically ignored Right side, towards front, part of brain, on top of and/or intertwined with motor strip:  not sure what this is, a stroke or tumor (the neurosurgeon and neurologist had differing opinions) 2/22--1st MRI--shows 2 spots  between these 2 MRIs the bloodwork, CT scan, and ultrasound are done--results normal 3/23--2nd MRI--larger lesion is bigger.  Was not thought to be a cancerous tumor 4/23--3rd MRI--Looks like larger lesion is improving.  A scheduled brain biopsy is postponed 5/20--4th MRI--the small spot is almost gone and the larger spot is much smaller, about 1/8th the size of the February MRI.  According to the neuro-oncologist, this was an atypical stroke.

                                                had anaphylactic reaction/throat and mouth swelled so much dentures pushed out of the top; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 77-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: ER8734, expiry date unknown), intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 02Apr2021, dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), arthritis, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus (DM), breast cancer which was in remission all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included isophane insulin (NPH INSULIN); potassium (manufacturer unknown); sertraline (manufacturer unknown); levothyroxine (manufacturer unknown); acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); calcium (manufacturer unknown); trazodone (manufacturer unknown); dicyclomine (manufacturer unknown); famotidine (PEPCID); insulin human injection, isophane (NOVOLIN N); carvedilol (manufacturer unknown); magnesium (manufacturer unknown); vitamin b complex (SUPER B COMPLEX [VITAMIN B COMPLEX]), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took sulfonamide and codeine and experienced allergy. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EN6208), intramuscular on 12Mar2021 at 07:30 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. On 10Apr2021, seven days post the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 19:30, the patient had anaphylactic reaction to shrimp in which she never had this reaction ever before, eating shrimp all the time, eating other items in the dinner all the time, throat and mouth swelled so much dentures pushed out of the top. The patient&#39;s husband called EMS and the patient was given Benadryl x 2, epi x2, shots x2, was intubated and woke up two days later in ICU. The patient&#39;s allergy and blood tests were negative for any possible food allergies that she had consumed on that day. The patient&#39;s doctor stated this event could have been absolutely related to the vaccine. The event resulted in a visit to the emergency room/department or urgent care and was hospitalized for 10 days. The patient received epinephrine, magnesium, antihistamine and steroids as treatment for the events. The patient was intubated and placed on a ventilator. The patient has not recovered from the events. The events were considered as a life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the known product safety profile, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported anaphylactic reaction cannot be completely excluded. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.

She is a shell of who she was and our family just simply misses her,I truly just wish that we would have had been warned of the possible risks to patients like her prior to getting the vaccine.No matter how small the possibility of adverse reaction.We would have chosen to keep her longer.

A 77-year-old female patient received bNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number&amp; Expiry date not reported) via unspecified route of administration in arm on 03Jun2021 (at age of 77-year-old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 Immunization. Patient medical history includes Memory Loss, Breast Cancer, Allergic to Sulfa Medication, Flexeril, Allergic to Clams and Shellfish, Pneumonia, Urinary infection. Patient concomitant medications were not reported. Caller reporting on behalf of his wife who received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jun2021 and she developed pneumonia and a urinary infection. She was prescribed amoxicillin for her infection. The caller wanted to know how the antibiotic will affect his wife. He reports her second Covid 19 vaccine is past due by 2 weeks. He reports his wife gets pneumonia every year and it is not from the Covid 19 vaccine. She received her first Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jun2021 and was due for the second Covid 19 vaccine on 24Jun2021. This is discrepant from the above information that his wife is past due by 2 weeks but is documented as provided by the caller. She will not be able to get the second Covid 19 vaccine until the first week in Jul2021. She waited because she was prescribed a Z-pack for her pneumonia started on 29Jun2021.She developed a urinary infection, she has a history of getting urinary infections too. The doctor also wanted a chest x-ray to make sure that her pneumonia was gone. The Amoxicillin will double check that his wife has no more pneumonia and will clear up her urinary infection. She was hospitalized in 2019 because of a urinary infection. The doctor prescribed Amoxicillin and she cannot wait any longer to get her second Covid 19 vaccine. She must get her second Covid 19 vaccine before time runs out. He reports none of this has to do with the Covid 19 vaccine. These are problems that his wife has had before.Upon follow up when probing for information regarding the sore arm he and his wife experienced he reports the sore arm was minor, it was just where the injection was in jun2021. His wife had breast cancer and can only get injections in one of her arms. It was a little soreness, nothing, barely noticeable. He and his wife did exactly what the pharmacist said, they took a lot of fluids, drank Gatorade for electrolytes. He reports his wife is sleeping right now because she was at the doctor&#39;s office this morning. He reports his wife&#39;s doctor is being thorough before his wife gets the second Covid 19 vaccine. He is supposed to call the pharmacy to schedule his wife&#39;s second Covid 19 vaccine on 03Jul2021. The pharmacist told him not to cancel his wife original appointment because it would remove her from the system. He&#39;s will call on 03Jul2021 and hopefully his wife will be able to get her second dose on 05Jul2021 or 06Jul2021. At that time, she&#39;ll almost be off the Amoxicillin. He is asking what the effectiveness rate is of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine while on an antibiotic.The pharmacist told him the effectiveness is diminished for people who have taken an antibiotic. He believes the first Covid 19 vaccine provides 70% effectiveness while the second Covid 19 vaccine provides 95% effectiveness. His sister-in-law has titanium plates in her back and must take an antibiotic for the rest of her life and she received the Covid 19 vaccine. Advised in response to caller to discuss with Health care professional about the final decision about receiving the second dose to discuss the risks and benefits of the administration of the vaccine and the HCP is most familiar with the health history of his wife. Pfizer is unable to make treatment recommendations for individual patients. Patient underwent lab test and procedures include Chest X-ray result was it showed nothing, no pneumonia; SARS-CoV-2 test was negative; Urine analysis result was unknown; all tests done on Jun2021. The outcome of event was unknown.   Follow up (29Jun2021): This is a follow up spontaneous report from a Pfizer Sponsored Program. A contactable consumer reported for a 77-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s wife) that: New information include medical history, schedule of second dose, Lab test, event little sore arm, visit of physician office.   No further information is provided or obtained.Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

She is concerned this is either a reaction to the COVID vaccination or may be recurrent symptoms related to her recent pericarditis and concern for rheumatologic etiology.  CT Chest showed Cardiomegaly and small pericardial effusion, similar to 1/4/2021.  Mild abnormality of CXR may be baseline.  Mild abnormality in ECG.  Elevated inflammatory markers and normal troponin.  As above this easily could be a flare of a prior diagnosis of pericarditis due to being on a prednisone taper.  She is under the care of a Rheumatologist. Concerned this is either a reaction to the COVID vaccination or may be recurrent symptoms related to her recent pericarditis on a steroid taper and concern for rheumatologic etiology.

                                                At approximately 930am I arrived at Memory Care.  I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt&#39;s room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state. She also stated that the hospice Nurse informed that the death was not due to the Vaccine. Per Lead Pharmacist at the clinic.

This 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL963), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 12:00 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included borderline high blood pressure, high cholesterol, Hashimoto&#39;s, hypothyroid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included rosuvastatin, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL), hydrochlorothiazide and lisinpro received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took ezetimibe (ZETIA) and experienced drug allergy. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. After sitting in recovery room for about 10 minutes following injection patient began to feel strange. Patient called the nurse on duty and said she felt like her heart was racing. The nurse took her BP and pulseox and administered a mini EKG. Then the nurse called the EMT on duty who gave patient a six leader EKG and said patient was in A Fib. Asked if patient had ever had A fib before, patient said no. Then asked if patient wanted to go to the hospital, patient said no. After sitting with the EMT for five minutes or so another EKG showed patient was no longer in A Fib. Patient felt shaky for the rest of the day, but is normal now. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The adverse event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received for the adverse event. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney ablation (ablation on the kidney cancer 5 years ago), kidney cancer, blood pressure, neuropathy, pain, had a urinary tract infection 19Dec2020 and they saw the cancer came back, radiologist read the CAT Scan and said the size of the tumor 1.5 to 2.4. Concomitant medications included acebutolol for blood pressure taking for years, diclofenac for neuropathy using for 10 years, oxycodone for pain taking 19 years; all ongoing, and oxycodone hydrochloride (OXYCONTIN) for pain. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Family Medical History was none. The caller stated that he was not sure if the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have given patient (his wife) COVID-19 or not. He also stated that when they received their vaccines the facility was very crowded as was the hospital when the wife was getting her blood work done so he was not sure when or where she contracted COVID-19. On 29Jan2021, patient was very busy running several errands including going to the hospital for bloodwork and a nuclear medicine injection as part of a work up for kidney ablation that the patient was supposed to have completed, patient was in the process of getting ready to have an ablation on her kidney and had the nuclear scan for her kidneys and then went to get a COVID test. After they got home, patient sat down at the computer and she started to act funny, kind of quiet and not talking which was unusual for her. So at about 1700PM the husband went in to ask her what kind of music she would like and he found her unconscious in the chair. He took her blood pressure and it was 60 over 4; with no heart rate; she was just barely breathing, he could tell by the way her mouth moved. He tried to breath for her, all of the sudden she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. He called (phone number provided) and they rushed her to the hospital, and the paramedics verified her heart was not beating and they started to do resuscitation. Then they finally pulled her out of the chair and put her on the floor and she started to breath. When they took her to the ambulance she was still not quite coherent; she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was taken to the hospital emergency room and stayed there for 12 hours and they monitored her with an EKG and only saw one spike for 6 seconds. They discharged her on 30Jan2021 afternoon and she has been totally normal 100 percent since then. Since she had been home she had been doing well and has had no other events. Added patient had never had a heart problem before. Caller stated that he was not sure if this event was related to her receiving the vaccine or not. Now they had to stay in quarantine 10 days until 08Feb2021 since the COVID test given at the hospital on 29Jan2021 night when she went in was positive. Patient was scheduled to received the second shot 18Feb2021. Outcome of events unconscious, no heart rate, pressure was 60 over 4 was recovered on 29Jan2021, events started to act funny and stopped breathing was recovered on 30Jan2021, outcome of other events was unknown. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, patient was taken to the ER and monitored for 12 hours but no admission. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

She was observed for over 15 minutes and had no history of any anaphylactic reaction of any sort. She felt fine and went home. 2/15/2021 we were notified by her family that she had passed away on 2/7/2021 at home. The cause of death was stated as myocardial infarct secondary to coronary artery disease. We do not think it had to do with the vaccine administration. The patient had many comorbidities.

                                                Acute ischemic stroke on 02Jan2021; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Healthcare Professional. A 78-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 28Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 78-year-old. Medical history and concomitant medications were unknown. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.

Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was recovering from the event. Patient has not tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information there is no evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship between the reported event of ischemic stroke and BNT162B2 administration.

She wondered if she should call Fire Dept (but wasn?t making total sense).

Of note she received her 2nd COVID vaccine dose on 03/05/2021 and since she has worsening SOB. Pt reported cough w/ yellow sputum prior to her admission. At urgent care, she was hypoxic with Sat 82%, therefore she was transferred to ED for further w/u. Lab w/u showed BNP of 1,074 and trop of 32. She was found to have a negative POC COVID-19 and PCR is pending. Bil venous Dopplers show acute occlusive DVT in the R popliteal vein above and below the knee w/ slow flow in the R fem vein and no DV IN the LLE. TTE on 03/31/2021 showed EF 65-70% w/ G2DD, mod-severe RV failure and severe pulmonary HTN, mod TR, and dilated IVC. Decision was made to CT chest w/ contrast despite renal function given high suspicion for PE. CT chest w/ contrast showed large clot burden PE w/ findings c/w R heart strain, a 12x9 mm lobulated nodule in the RUL concerning for neoplasm, increasing patchy infiltrates, and increasing R pleural effusion and new trace L pleural effusion. Patient required 12L O2 via NC. IR was contacted at but felt that patient was not a candidate for CDT or for IVC filter. Patient was transferred to ICU for further care. Patient received IV heparin per the PE Protocol from, Alteplase 40mg on 4/1, and was started on treatment dose of Eliquis.

                                                Pneumonia after getting the COVID Vaccine; Pneumonia was related to MRSA; Very weak; mild fever; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 78-years-old, administered in arm on 25Feb2021 15:45 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus from 2011 (Verbatim: Diabetic; Diagnosed 10 years ago), rheumatoid arthritis from 1995 (Verbatim: Rheumatoid arthritis; Diagnosed in 1995), cardiac failure congestive from Oct2020 (Verbatim: Congestive Heart Failure), adrenal insufficiency from 1990 (Verbatim: Adrenal insufficiency; Diagnosed in probably 1990), atrial fibrillation from 2017 (Verbatim: Atrial fibrillation; Diagnosed 4 years ago). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (&#34;she takes lots of medications. Too long of list she probably takes 15 different medications, reporter chose not to provide them). No-other vaccines were given at the same time. She gets the flu vaccine every year, shingles vaccines, pneumonia vaccines every year but, has no idea where they were manufactured. Confirmed she did not get the listed vaccines at the same time she got the COVID Vaccine. The patient&#39;s husband and the patient (his wife) both received their 1st COVID shot on the 25Feb2021 and was scheduled for 3 weeks later. He got his COVID on the 18Mar2021. The patient got Pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital but he does not know the exact time the Pneumonia started. It developed over a period of several day started with a mild fever (in Mar2021) and after the 2nd or 3rd day her fever spiked and that&#39;s when she was admitted to the hospital. He reports his wife went into the hospital with Pneumonia on 18Mar2021, the day she was supposed to get the 2nd shot. It was also reported that Pneumonia was related to MRSA. She laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks, the weakness (&#34;very weak&#34;) may have happened in the hospital or a few days before, date was confirmed to be on 15Mar2021. The event &#34;pneumonia&#34; was totally unrelated to COVID and now she is in a nursing home, she went in on 26Mar2021. She probably won&#39;t be able to have the 2nd shot for a couple of weeks. She was in there for a couple of weeks and still quarantined. He wanted to know will the fact that she is not getting the 2nd shot at the 3-week interval reduce the efficacy of the vaccine since she is getting the 2nd dose late. Does it make a difference with the effectiveness of the vaccine if she&#39;s going take the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks or even a month and a half rather than the usual 21 days interval? No treatment before going to the hospital other than calling the doctor and the doctor saying take her to the hospital (not reported if patient received treatment during hospital stay). No treatment done over the weekend, while she was in the nursing home. The adverse event pneumonia required a visit to Emergency Room. The patient was hospitalized from 18Mar2021 to 26Mar2021. Investigations included had a lot of blood work done, a CT scan, an X-ray on unspecified dates. He does not have any of the results but, the physicians have them. The outcome of the event mild fever was unknown, for very weak was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovered on 26Mar2021.

                                                On 2/18/21, 10 days after receiving the vaccine, I donated blood as usual.  About 30 minutes later I was light headed, had abdominal cramping pain, bowel emptying and possibly fainted.  I was transported by EMTs to the ER and was later diagnosed with inflamitory bowel by a CT scan.  I took antibiotics and was feeling fine.  My gastroenterologist performed a colonoscopy on 3/24/21 and the findings were that I was healed and tissue samples were normal.  3/25/21 I had an annual physical and was told I was in good health.  Later that afternoon I began feeling light headed upon standing.  In the night I called my health insurance hotline because my blood oxygen meter was beeping  continuously.  The Dr. on call told me to go by ambulance to the ER.  When sitting or lying down, I felt fine and all the tests at the ER for my heart and my vital signs were good.  A few hours later, they did a hest Xray and then a CT scan of my lungs which showed a saddle embulism.  I had also  thought I had bruised my knee if and when I fainted on 2/18 and  1o hours later a blood lot was found by ultrasound of my left knee.  I was given blood thinners in the ER and then in ICU where I spent the next night.  I am now taking Eleris.  I was also given pantoprozole for GERD coughing the next day.  I continue to have periods of abdominal ramping/pain, light headedness in waves and pressure in my head.  I have disontinued the stomach medication with some feeling better with the lightheadedness.

A 78-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm  on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination 78 years).  The patient medical history was not reported.  On 04Feb2021 the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 and experienced sore arm.   The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced pain with walking left leg  on 28Feb2021 with outcome of recovering , left leg swelling/ it got so swollen/left foot swelling  on 03Mar2021 with outcome of not recovered , numerous blood clots below the knee  on 04Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results,  ultrasound joint: numerous blood clots below the knee   on 04Apr2021   , vital signs measurement: unknown results.  Course of the event: The patient  waited for the timeframe after the second dose and had no problems. 4 days after, she experienced pain with walking in her left leg.  She took Aleve for a few days.  It got so swollen, she should have gone then to her Primary Medical Doctor, but she did not go until 25Mar2021. She was sent to  Hospital for an Ultrasound of her leg on 04Apr2021.  After the Ultrasound, she was taken to the Emergency Department at the hospital. The doctor told her she had numerous blood clots below the knee.  Was prescribed Eliquis 5mg.  She was instructed to take 2 tablets or 10mg twice a day, 8hrs apart for 1 week and then 1 tablet twice a day for the remainder of the 74 tablets. She completed that. She was out of them and got a refill of Eliquis 5mg on 26Apr2021. She received 60 tablets and can refill for 5 times. She is really concerned. The swelling is still so bad and so that could that mean blood clots are still in there. The ER doctor told her that the medication is dangerous.  It thins the blood and can cause bleeding and the blood clot can go to her heart.  Follow up information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causality has been assessed as related to bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm  on 24Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for covid-19 immunization, based on temporal association and profile of the product.,Linked Report(s) : 2021499984 same patient/drug, diff dose/event

A 79-year-old elderly female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRANTY; Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Apr2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.

Additional Context: Consumer states that her doctor wanted her to call and report this, because she has asthma and allergies that are chronic. Consumer states that she took her first Pfizer injection in April. She saw her allergy specialist on the 1st, and she tested the Consumer before she took the vaccine. She states that her breathing was at 113% breathing capacity (good) and the allergy specialist wanted her to go ahead and get the injection, which the Consumer did. Consumer clarifies that she received the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 11Apr2021 and that she did really good with that one. Consumer then received the second COVID vaccine on 13May2021. She came home and slept almost all night long and thought she was okay. The Consumer explains she was not feeling real good before she went to receive her second dose. It was kind of like she was having some coughing and stuff, but she thought it was not bad and that she could still go ahead and get it. She went ahead on 13May2021 and had the second dose. Consumer states that on the first day, she slept all day long- the whole entire day, she didn&#39;t even wake up. On the second day, the Consumer states that she had soreness in her arm.

On Thursday night, she got so bad that her breathing was down in the danger zone at 220. She couldn&#39;t breathe. Her husband rushed her back to the ER and this time, they kept the Consumer and hospitalized her for a week. Her blood pressure was high. She clarifies normally her breathing on her peak flow meter, she can always do from 350-400. Well on Thursday night, her peak flow was all the way down to 220 and she could not catch her breath. Consumer states that she was admitted to the hospital and they had her on oxygen and blood pressure medication. She states that they did a bronch on her and still did not really come to a conclusion of what was happening. She was told it looked like it could be an infection in her lungs. Consumer states that she is having to see three doctors this week because of this since she got out of the hospital. She saw her medical doctor, Dr., yesterday who was very concerned because she had a recent patient that was about the same age as the Consumer- he was 75 years old. This patient had done the same thing, only he ended up taking pneumonia and dying with it. The doctor told the Consumer in her x-ray, her doctor could see that she had some pneumonia showing. The Consumer asked her doctor while she was in the hospital about the pneumonia and they refused to listen to anything the Consumer said, so Dr. told her that the Consumer needed to report this because she is still so sick. Consumer clarifies that she was hospitalized for a week and that she just got out on Saturday, 29May2021. While reporting the event details, the Consumer stated that she had and emergency call coming through and that she had to take it. Consumer had to end the call, stating she had to go and requested this call handler call her back. The patient was hospitalized due to events.

For 3 weeks she felt SOB with CP.  She presented to hospital and found to have bilateral pulmonary embolisms.  Please contact patient for further details.  She states she is very healthy and does not have risk factors for clots.  She requested I fill out this form for her.  I spoke to our pharmacy and they directed me here.  I do not know all of the details therefore more investigation should be performed.

                                                I experienced shortness of breath and inability to draw a deep breath.  I thought I was experiencing allergies. I went to see my primary care physician&#39;s assistant.  She became alarmed when my heart rate was 141 and insisted I go to the hospital via ambulance right then (May 11, 2021 approximated 10:30 a.m.) I spent the first day in the Emergency Room at Hospital then was admitted  to a private room.  I was discharged on May 14th  with prescriptions for Eliquis, digoxin, lasix, metoprolol, and lisinipril with the hope that m heart would return to normal pulse on its own,  I had a echocardiogram, confirming Atrial Flutter.   had an angiogram and was told there were no blockages.  I had a transesophageal echocardiogram.  It determined the doctor could not safely shock my heart back into rhythm.  I have another scheduled for July 1, 2021.

She exercises regularly and has become so weak that she cannot climb stairs.  Neurological exam revealed hyperreflexia, subtle proximal muscle weakness, the presence of a startle reflex and rooting reflex, clonus, and a positive Babinski.  Infectious work up has been negative, autoimmune evaluation is underway.  Inpatient neurology consultation has been obtained, she was given a trial of diazepam for stiff person syndrome and started on daily IVIG on 2/3/2021 for a 5 day course. She continues to have an elevated CRP, a mild transaminitis, and mild thrombocytopenia.  The ESR dropped from 44 to 20 with hydration.  She has had no cognitive changes. No headache, visual changes, jaw pain. We are unable to obtain MRI given the presence of these coils which are not MRI compatible.  Encephalitis immune antibodies are pending, myositis panel, MOG antibodies ADEM are pending, GAD65 antibody pending.

Concomitant medication included Levothyroxine at 100mcg taken once daily in the morning early before she eats with Start date unknown, but at least 10-15 years ago for Thyroid. Enalapril at 10mg taken once daily (Caller initially reported product name as Vasotec, but clarified it is not Vasotec, it is drop for eye cataract and glaucoma) for High blood pressure. Brimonidine with Strength unknown, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily, started maybe 1 year ago. Specified cataract and glaucoma in left eye; but drop was administered to both eyes; and left eye was eye affected by Bell&#39;s palsy for Cataract and glaucoma in left eye. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy with onset maybe about 50 years ago, she was not sure; occurred during dental procedure; had bad headaches but no lasting effects so they assumed allergy to codeine; she did not know if still has allergy but says she does if asked.

She thinks it was the night of 27Jan2021 or 28Jan2021 when she asked her son if her face looked funny, did she look ok, because her face felt a little funny. She was looking in the mirror and her smile was looking crooked, and her eye looked like it was drooping.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

The facility the vaccine was administered was public health clinic/veterans administration facility. The patient went into AFib on 19Mar2021 at 23:45, 12 hours after receiving the dose (as reported). She was told to drink plenty of liquids following the shot, which she did because she was so thirsty. The patient was in AFib for about 18 hours until it resolved into sinus rhythm. She wondered if there was any association with the vaccine and heart rhythm. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event &#34;went into A Fib&#34;. She was not tested with COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the event &#34;went into A Fib&#34; was recovered on 20Mar2021 at 17:45 and unknown for the other event.

At that time her temperature was 97.3. She felt fine the rest the day.   At 1 AM she woke up with shakes. She continued with nausea and that resulted in vomiting and then diarrhea. She also had severe pain in her thighs. This was severe enough that she called the ambulance.   Patient also relates later that she had had some burning on urination 2 days prior to the vaccination. She had leftover Macrodantin that she took 9 PM yesterday.   Also relates back in December she was seen by Dr for vaginal infection and 2 times a week she has to administer intravaginal antibiotics.   She has had multiple GI bleeds secondary to esophageal varices and is followed regularly by Dr who has had to do multiple banding procedures on her.   She also relates she has an enlarged spleen and is followed by Dr.   In the emergency room she was noted to be febrile and hypotensive. She received a total of 5 L of normal saline in the ER to bring her pressures up with a systolic below 100. She has a very elevated procalcitonin as well as lactic acid. Urine is positive for large amount of blood and small leukocyte esterase  Hospital Course 79 y.o. year old female with HTN, infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast stage I status post lumpectomy with positive margins was on anastrozole but taken off secondary to abnormal liver enzyme testing, CLL/thrombocytopenia stage I with no treatment needed, fatty liver complicated by portal hypertension/splenomegaly resulting in bleeding esophageal varices, history of viral cardiomyopathy in 2006, B12 deficiency, history of admission for septic shock, chronic diarhea, presented to the emergency room on 2/14 complaining of fevers, myalgias fatigue nausea and vomiting 24 hours after having a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

I WANT TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE THERE MAY BE A CHANCE THAT OLDER PERSONS ALREADY PRESENTING WITH CARDIOMYOPATHY MIGHT BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THESE SYMPTOMS WHILE NOT HAVING THE SAME LEVEL OF INFLAMATION AS IS  BEING NOTICED IN YOUNG ADULTS.   INDIVIDUALS AT MY AGE TEND TO HAVE SO MANY COMORBIDITIES UNTIL THEY MAY BE UNLIKELY TO NOTICE NEW SYMPTOMS.

                                                On February 18, 2021, three days after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, patient was rushed to the emergency room with rapidly dropping blood pressure and difficulty keeping conscious.   After being in COVID isolation for 24 hours, I saw her in a hospital bed and she looked like a corpse.   The initial diagnosis was severe Sepsis with liver, kidney and heart problems and blood clots in both lungs.  She had never had any of this before getting the Pfizer vaccine.  Her WBC count was also very high.   She was hospitalized for 10 days and then sent to a rehab facility for 14 days before returning to her independent living facility.   She is now taking blood thinners for the blood clots which she didn&#39;t have prior to taking the vaccine.  He did a miracle in sparing her life!

A non-pregnant 80-year-old female patient received two doses of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, the first dose in 2020 and the second dose on 22Dec2020 11:00, both at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included heart, diabetes, obesity.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient did not have covid prior to vaccination.  The patient contracted COVID on 04Jan2021 11:00. The patient was hospitalized for COVID-19 for 8 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: Nasal Swab: negative on 24Dec2020, negative on 28Dec2020, negative on 31Dec2020, positive on 04Jan2021.  Unspecified therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event.  The outcome of patient contracted COVID was fatal.  The patient died on 12Jan2021.  It was unknown if an autopsy was performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: patient contracted COVID

Abdominal pain complaints increased and continued, she decompensated rapidly, was intubated and subsequently died 3 days later.  Imaging results showed, progressive ovarian cancer in the bowels.  Blood culture revealed that she had E.Coli in her blood.  It is thought that this is NOT related to the vaccine.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

                                                Chills, vomiting, worsening confusion. Patient had vomiting that began about 48 hours after vaccine dose. Had subsequent chills. No fever.  Evaluated by her primary care provider on 2/26 AM and the ER at Hospital on 2/26 PM.  Noted to have chills, nausea and vomiting in the ER. Also noted to have tachycardia, likely related to her atrial fibrillation. She had been unable to take her home medications due to vomiting and had missed her rate controlling medications. She was given IV Zofran and Tylenol with good control of her chills and vomiting.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

Patient was diagnosed with COVID on 4/22 at outside clinic after presenting with about a week of cough, nausea and fatigue. On 5/2/21 she presented to our emergency department with persistence of the above symptoms and hypoxia to the 70s on room air and again tested positive for COVID. Initially required BIPAP then HFNC. She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for 7 days and dexamethasone for 10 days. She was offered tocilizumab and remdesivir but refused. She clinically improved and was weaned down to 2L NC w/saturation of 93%. However on 5/13 she acutely desaturated and was found pulseless. Patient was DNR/DNI so was pronounced dead.

                                                Patient is an 80 y/o right handed female who is totally independent at baseline who received her Pfizer vaccine out of the country (1st dose 2/19/21, 2nd dose 3/12/21).  She was reactive to both shots, reporting arthralgias, headache, low grade fever, chills. She had a rise in blood pressure later during the day of her shot as well as the next day (up to 180/70, from baseline of 130/70). She also had an episode of epistaxis several days after her first shot.  She traveled independently out of the country on 3/31/21 to visit her son on a leisure trip. On 4/5/21 she had headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, and did not feel well, and her systolic BP was 198, after which she took additional 40 mg of lisinopril.   Her BP subsequently decreased to systolic BP of 130 mm Hg on 4/5/21, but over the next few days she had labile BP with a range of BP of 125 to 171/ 58 - 68.  She was meticulous in checking and recording her BP several times a day, and she increased her lisinopril dose to 40 mg po qd from 20 mg po qd given the higher than usual blood pressure range.  On 4/10/21 her BP was as follows: 6:30 am, 148/60 (she took her daily lisinopril 20 mg po); 11:30 am:  132/52; 3 pm: 171/69 (she took additional lisinopril 20 mg po) after which her systolic BP decreased to 130. Then around 6:20 pm the same day (4/10/21), she had acute onset of headache, vomiting, left sided weakness, SBP 220, and was witnessed to have rapid change in mental status. There was no antecedent trauma to the head. EMTs were called immediately and she had loss of consciousness during the ambulance ride to the ED, after about 20 minutes of symptom onset, with agonal breathing and bradycardia to the 40s, but never lost her pulse. Upon arrival to the ED out of the country, her Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) was 6, she was rapidly intubated and stabilized. Head CT demonstrated massive intraparenchymal hemorrhage (140 cc) within the R temporal parietal and occipital lobes, with cerebral edema and 14 mm midline shift, associated with small subdural hematoma and small intraventricular hemorrhage within the temporal horn and body of the R lateral ventricle. They reported hyperdense &#34;spot sign&#34; within the intraparenchymal hematoma compatible with active hemorrhage, no evidence of venous thrombosis, no masses, no arteriovenous malformations. She had 2.5 mm aneurysm right  that was thought to be incidental finding unrelated to her event. She was taken emergently to the OR on 4/10/2021 for decompressive R hemicraniectomy, which she underwent successfully with minimal blood loss.  She had no coagulopathy and her platelets and hemoglobin were normal. She remained in the Neuro ICU for 3 weeks. She received a tracheostomy two weeks after her presentation, and was weaned off the ventilator. She is breathing spontaneously after 5 weeks from presentation. She remains in coma or minimally conscious state, with GCS score of 5-6 as of 5/13/2021.

When probed for second shot vaccination timings, consumer stated, &#34;her second shot was on &#34;319&#34; (Further not clarified). On 19Mar2021, she woke up and her teeth were killing her like she slept she was fine but in the morning she had terrible toothache and she was taking care of her teeth, she had Flu like symptoms her eyes puffed up, swelled and runny nose, she went to a Dermatologist Doctor and she gave her some medicine to take swelling down, she had severe leg cramps and could hardly barely walk. She was trying to find out if she could have blood clot, she could have everything, she went to funeral and she had to leave early, she left and fly back Home, it disturbed her, it could be from Pfizer shot.

Consumer stated, she went to a Dermatologist to see why her face is swallowed up. She would like to be followed up, what she was to do with her pain, she was like crippled, she was in pain all the time, she would like to know Pfizer to tell her what medication she needs to take. She did not know, the Doctor knows what to give. She needs them to recommend what they are giving to other people those are having these severe reactions. Consumer stated, she had two Pfizer shots (both doses) and she had a severe adverse effect. Now it was difficult she had severe pain in her legs. she walks 3 miles a day. she had her eyes swell as well, she went to a Dermatologist. She walks to her Doctor after the severe pain from the Pfizer shot, he gave her some pain treatment Tramadol and &#34;Ibuprofen&#34; (not clarified) besides the fact that it will help.

She had severe swelling then she had her teeth ache, for eye condition and skin she went to Dermatologist and he gave her &#34;Hydrocortisone&#34; (name not clarified) several days for two weeks and her teeth have no pain in her teeth. She woke up this morning and felt cry it was painful and she don&#39;t know what to do about this adverse effect. she wanted to ask to Pfizer people to get medicine. The caller has had severe adverse effects after receiving the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. The caller could barely use her legs, the legs were in severe pain. The caller was a person that walked and exercised, walked 3 miles a day. The caller could barely get around, and up and down in the morning is hell. The caller was so weak and the legs hurt so bad. The other effect was the caller&#39;s eyes swelled up and ran sticky oozy stuff. The caller went to the dermatologist and was given cortisone and after 14-15 days that cleared up, it was white. The caller went to her doctor about the pain in her legs. The caller was taking Tramadol and Ibuprofen and they were not a lot of help. The doctor said it will run its course. The caller asked how long it will be and the doctor said the good news is it will go away and that is about all the doctor would say.

                                                Bleeding/felt blood on her arm /blood was coming from the top of the band aid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for self. This 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL3248) via unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 02:00 PM at right arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, clopidogrel (manufacturer: Aurobindo, lot# QR7520022-A, expiry date: Apr2022) oral from Dec2020 at 75 mg once a day for TIA (Transient ischaemic attack). Medical history included TIA from Aug2019. She had her first TIA Aug2019, and then had her second a couple months ago, it was not as severe, the buildings moved and she walked like she was drunk, but had only one other thing than walking funny and buildings moving, she can&#39;t remember what that was. Pain, blood cholesterol abnormal.  Pain in both of her arms, she said her left arm hurt more than her right arm from time to time, and when the left started hurting she took all the pills, but she didn&#39;t take Hydrocodone though it is prescribed, she didn&#39;t take that unless she was in a lot more pain than usual. She said her doctors said different things about her arm pain, one said she had a torn rotator cuff, another said arthritis, someone else said it was something in her neck but it was a big word that she didn&#39;t know, she just knew she had pain. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN, manufacturer: Bayer, UPC number: 349483 48150) from Aug2019 for TIA; carbamazepine from Jan2021 for pain in both of her arms; metoprolol succinate, had been taking it a couple years; zolpidem; hydrocodone for pain (she only takes if she is dying of pain, clarified to being in a lot of pain); atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient reported that she had COVID-19 and experienced side effect. She said it happened after the 15 minutes observation when she left to drive home on 14Jan2021. She said 5 minutes into her drive she felt blood on her arm and put her hand in her shirt, and wiped it, saw blood. She said the bleeding was weird so she pulled over to look at her arm, and blood was coming from the top of the band aid where normally it would seep down from the bottom. She used five baby wipe, and wiped a lot of blood, until finally she thought it stopped bleeding. She was not light headed or in pain, it was a 45 minute drive and she got home and was still bleeding so she took her shirt off and put a towel around it to stop the bleeding and it finally stopped. She said she didn&#39;t think to report it until her doctor said to when she told him, he had said maybe the girl who gave her the shot hit a vein, but she should tell them. She said maybe she did hit a vein, because she had never had problems when getting a shot or more than a spot of blood in the past. She said one thing that may be important was that she had a couple of TIAs, many series (unable to clarify) her doctor friend assessed that with three MRIs and MRAs. She said she just refilled one of her medications, Clopidogrel, and was reading the instructions for it and it says it can cause excessive bleeding. She said that she was not bleeding so she didn&#39;t worry about it, that maybe that caused excessive bleeding.  She had not had a second dose, but she didn&#39;t want to go through this again with the bleeding, though if it was just a vein or air that may not happen. She said she was very healthy, no underlying conditions at all, never had a problem before, her arm was not painful, she was not light headed. She said the baby wipe she had on her arm after the car ride was full of blood, and she still couldn&#39;t get the band aid off, so she wrapped her arm towel kept sopping up blood until finally it quit. She put another band aid over the bloody band aid, and it quit and she was fine. She had no injection site pain, no tiredness, no headache. Lab data included she had MRIs and MRAs, but there was no bleeding. The action taken for clopidogrel was unknown. The outcome of event was recovered.

The reporter&#39;s mother died 3 weeks and 6 days after having received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The cause of death was a &#34;widow maker&#34; type heart attack where the LAD artery suddenly became 100% blocked by a blood clot; the event began about 11:45pm on 04Mar2021. The blockage was confirmed via cardiac cath procedure performed within 2 hours of the onset by Doctor, he removed the clot and placed a stent. However her heart was too damaged and could not recover. Doctor confirmed to us that she did not have excessive or evidence of any prior blockage and not excessive plaque. The blood clot likely came on and caused the cardiac event within roughly an hour, he explained. The patient had no prior symptoms and no comorbidities for blood clotting and was full of life and energy on 05Mar up to when she went to bed that night. She died 06Mar at 4:04 am at hospital.

An 81-year-old non pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number, Expiry date UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on an unknown date in Feb2021 (at the age of 81 years old) as a single dose for COVID 19 immunisation. Medical history was not reported. The patient received the medications within 2 weeks of vaccination was Asperin. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number, Expiry date UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on an unknown date in Feb2021 experienced adverse events such as large bruising on one leg, after the next dose, bruising on the other leg. She has bruising on both lower limbs, a bleeding disorder. She bled from her eye at the ophthalmologists office. On an unspecified date patient second one, then had bruising in the other leg. She went to the hematologist, and to the doctor. The doctor did PTT, confirmed as PTT, and it was elevated. Reported added that patient also had an elevated potassium. She states this was like what you would get if patient were taking warfarin. it was very concerning now, not only does she have bruising in the leg, but she was bleeding into the eye and that to her was just, it keeps getting worse. She has nothing else to add to that report except that her mom has an elevated PTT, TPTT and states she does not know, it was thrombo. At 81, her mom walks around an hour a day, does aerobics. She was not seeing a hematologist and she was concerned. If she cut herself, she would bleed out. The fact she was bleeding into the eyeball, she has to google the acronym but it was basically clotting issues it was resulting in. No additional details provided; Reporter did not know the name of the elevated test.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I would have her check her sugar and it would be fine,  but I dismissed it as a good thing that her sugar was ok.  It didn?t cross my mind until the major strokes that it could be related to the vaccine.  She had major strokes in May as a result of blood clots in heart and head.  I strongly believe that her death is related to the vaccine.  She was well,  and had her diabetes under control,  and three months after getting the vaccine,  she was dead.

It has not done anything but stayed in the muscle occasionally; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This 81-year-old female consumer (patient) reported for herself.  An 81-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0176, Expiration date: 20Aug2021), via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 15May2021 (at the age of 81-year-old) as DOSE 2, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0164, Expiration date: 20Aug2021), via intramuscular, administered in right arm on 24Apr2021 at 12:15 or 12:30 (at the age of 81-year-old) as DOSE 1, SINGLE. The patient medical history includes Pneumonia cryptococcal (Dormant Lung disease cryptococcus), Osteopenia, Pancreatic disorder, Crohn&#39;s disease and Colectomy (2002), Cancer, Diabetes mellitus and Polyp, aphasia and seizures (1996).  Dormant Lung disease cryptcoccus, this comes from pigeons, bats and birds poo flying in the air. With allergies the caller breathed it in on some far at the time in year 2000. Checked every year since year 2000.  Gastroenterologist after many undisclosed solution for drastic weight loss since year 2018, now several tests have determined the caller&#39;s pancreas and stomach are not cooperating with each other. The caller has many issues with what the Gastroenterologist are doing with the caller, she feels like a Guinea pig. Concomitant medications include PANCREATIN (CREON) for Pancreatic disorder, AMITRIPTYLINE for Cerebral disorder and CYANOCOBALAMIN (B12-VITAMIIN). The patient was taking concomitant products creon because stomach and pancreas not cooperating with each other. In relation back up to brain thing drug for that is Amitriptyline. Began taking probably 12 years ago, 10 years ago at least. B12 was taking for memory, began taking probably 4 years ago courtesy of all the testing the general physician had done. The caller states she was lacking in so much and will be on this for the rest of life. Amitriptyline was supposed to take 10mg pill twice a day but don&#39;t take twice a day. Caller is getting antsy about putting too many chemicals in the body. When the caller is crying again will take more amitriptyline. So far just upset about current Pfizer situation. Only member to have Crohn&#39;s disease and intestines removed. Gall bladder, caller has not gotten. Cancer, diabetes and polyps in family history.  On 15May2021, after the vaccination, the patient experienced bad side effects of excruciating pain 3.5 hours later and the pain was for some reason was in left arm. This arm pain lasted off and on for two days. It was extreme pain. It has not done anything but stayed in the muscle occasionally, and the shoulder joint was picking occasionally, on the left and the caller still had the clicking. The pain was a normal like grade of 2 to 3 type pain at the time of this report. Whenever the caller twinges the pain happens on its own. Patient also experienced wobbly ankles, knees and hips. The caller&#39;s walking was terrible, caller states this is just persisting but at a lower level. The caller is concerned because she is a fracture risk person because of osteopenia. Patient experienced blurry eyes and tiredness. The caller usually gets blurry eyes when the caller is not hydrated enough because of loss of weight and the ileostomy bag itself is free flowing so the caller&#39;s retention is not good to begin with. The caller clarifies the infectious disease doctor when the caller was reviewed in April, prior to receiving the Pfizer Covid Vaccines, knew the caller was under weight and severely effected because the caller wears an ileostomy bag due to Chron&#39;s disease and intestines being removed twice. The caller&#39;s absorption is not normal to begin with. When the doctor&#39;s office authorized the caller to get the Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine in the first place it was within a 20 minute response time and nobody evidently checked the caller&#39;s chart prior to approving the caller to get this serious serious of Pfizer Covid Vaccines. Which is why the caller is so annoyed. The patient fell asleep on the couch with the radio on.  The caller woke up to her surprise not knowing that she had even gone to sleep for a God knows unknown period. The caller continued to listen to all her favorite shows on the Saturday night radio and it happened again, the caller doesn&#39;t know the time it was the caller fell asleep again, patient also states that she passed out or what the heck ever is going on with the caller&#39;s brain. Patient also experienced tiredness, she states she delivered the grocers and unloaded the groceries and was really wiped out. She also experienced impaired driving ability that on the way back from her brothers house she doesn&#39;t even remember driving away at about 21:00. She states God knows how many minutes later in the caller&#39;s driveway sitting at the steering wheel of the caller&#39;s car.

On 1/12/21  I received a call from the nursing home that my mom had stopped eating and drinking and that she had nothing to eat or drink for 3 days. I asked them why they didn&#39;t call me sooner but they did not have an answer. I was told to come in because she was very lethargic and possible dehydrated.  They tested her for Covid the morning of 1/12/21 and she tested negative.  I went into see my mom and she was barely conscious.  They gave her fluids intravenously but it had no positive affect on her condition.  On 1/14/21 she tested positive for covid and was moved to their covid unit.  I called in Hospice comfort care on 1/15/21.  My. mom died on 1/17/21.

                                                Heart attack; Asthma attacks; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date (she has had Asthma for about 14-15 years), broke back from an unknown date (she broke her back about 3 years ago); stent placement from an unknown date (she had 2 heart stents placed about 2 years ago), and then she said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 16Mar2021. She said she would really like to know if the COVID-19 Vaccine possibly caused her to have the worse asthma attack she ever had in her life on 17Mar2021. She clarified she was talking to her friend on the telephone when she had her asthma attack at 3:30PM. She said that on 18Mar2021 at 5:00AM, she had a second asthma attack. She said her second asthma attack was not as bad as the one she had on 17Mar2021. For her first asthma attack on 17Mar2021, she took 2 puffs from her inhaler, and then an additional 2 puffs (4 puffs total). She said her doctor told her if she had a bad asthma attack, she could take 2 more puffs from the inhaler. She said she normally takes 2 puffs from her inhaler. She said for her second asthma attack on 18Mar2021 she took only 2 puffs from her inhaler. After she took her 2 puffs from her ProAir HFA Albuterol Sulfate inhaler, she flopped back into her bed. She reported she normally has 3-4 asthma attacks a year. She reported that her doctor did a complete blood workup on 03Mar2021 and told her she was doing just lovely. The patient also reported she had a very mild heart attack and she can&#39;t even take low dose aspirin. The patient also reported she had another question about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) and wanted to know if anything in the list of the COVID-19 Vaccine ingredients would indicate her having a possible allergy to the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and/or Physician Office. The outcome of the event asthma attack was recovering, and for the heart attack was unknown.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

A 82-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 at the age of 82-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient took the shot at the regional vaccination center and she had an appointment of course set up by her doctor, but they don&#39;t have any specific name. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medication included metoprolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that his/her mother experienced a reaction after having the shot. She took the shot on 12Mar2021 and suffered from atrial fibrillation and she has not had atrial fibrillation in over 13 months and once she took the shot on the very next day (13Mar2021) she had atrial fibrillation which lasted about two and a half day. They went to her heart doctor and they checked her out and they said that other people that had taken the vaccine had experience the same thing so, the reporter was calling to see if that was something Pfizer has heard before or not. It was reported that the patient was scheduled to take the second shot this coming Friday and after speaking with her doctor they indicated to go ahead and take the second shot but again the reporter wanted to report this because the reporter knew the company was keeping a record of this information. It was reported that the patient was about 5 feet 7 inches and probably 140 pounds. The outcome of the event was recovered on 15Mar2021.

                                                Patient admitted on 5/5/21 for suspected acute ischemic CVA after presenting with altered speech for a day (last known well on 5/4/21 PM). No CT evidence of an acute intracranial process. Her pacemaker precluded MRI evaluation.  Pacer interrogated on 5/6/21 with AT/AF burden &lt;0.1%. She was seen in consultation by neurology.  Evaluation and clinical deficits were suggestive of acute ischemic CVA. Risk factors for CVA include age, HTN, Afib. Patient recently received her first COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer) on 4/26/21. Patient?s symptoms improving with antiplatelet and statin therapies along with blood pressure management. Per Neurology consult, possible etiologies include cardioembolic versus atheroembolic versus thrombotic versus inflammatory related to recent COVID-19 vaccine. The neurologist specifically stated that ?The COVID vaccine was temporally close to this event. I have seen transient CNS inflammation from the vaccine--probability low but still possibility.?

Sometime after the afternoon of 2/7/21 and the morning of 2/8/21 she was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor.  As her dinner from the evening of 2/7/21 was still on the table unfinished and she was fully dressed we assume that whatever caused her to end up on the floor unconscious happened on 2/7/21  She was taken to the emergency room and it was determined that she was not going to survive.  She never regained consciousness and was having seizures all the way to the hospital in the back of the ambulance.  She was made comfortable and passed on 2/11/21.

An 82-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER CORONA VIRUS VACCINES-COVID-19), dose 2 intramuscularly administered in the right arm on 04Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism and osteoporosis. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER CORONA VIRUS VACCINES-COVID-19) on an unspecified date for Covid-19 immunisation. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); calcium; acetylcysteine, calcium levomefolate, mecobalamin (METAFOLBIC PLUS); losartan; hydrochlorothiazide; denosumab (PROLIA) and trazodone; all indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was unknown if the patient receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that in the evening of the vaccination (04Mar2021), she developed chills and fever, then chest pain and shortness of breath. The physician obtained a CXR (chest x-ray) on the patient on 04Mar2021 and found that she had pneumonia. She was treated with levofloxacin and prednisone. The physician rechecked her in one week and gave her Kenalog injection and Rocephin injection. The physician rechecked her on 22Mar2021 and she was improved, but she returned to the office 12Apr2021 with left leg swelling. The ultrasound on 12Apr2021 showed an occlusive clot in her femoral artery. The patient was admitted to the hospital (Apr2021) for 1 day and placed on heparin, then sent home on Eliquis. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and the patient received treatment which included antibiotics and steroids for pneumonia and blood thinners for the femoral vein clot. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The outcome of the events leg swelling, occlusive clot in her femoral artery and femoral vein clot were recovered on Apr2021 while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 22Mar2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events peripheral swelling, peripheral artery thrombosis and venous thrombosis limb and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded.The case will be reassessed once new information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Chest xray showed radiographic evidence of pneumonia in RLL but without evidence of acute PE on CT scan. Patient was requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations and so was placed on high flow nc with better response 4/23 remained on HFNC 4/24 BCx from 4.22.21 growing out gram positive cocci in 1/2 bottles 4/26 HFNC at 50% and 45L 4/27 off HFNC and on 6 L NC/ awaiting PT evaluation 4/28 per, OT assessment -- pt dropped into 70&#39;s on 6L 02 with short walk to bathroom and toileting tasks. cues for rest and PLB needed to increase 02 into 80s. with a seated rest break over 5 mins 02 increased to 88% on 6L  COVID pneumonia (first dose of Pfizer vaccine mid April) S/P remdesivir X 5 days, now on day 8/10 decadron but will go home on oral decadron  Acute hypoxic respiratory failure slowly improving (not on home oxygen therapy) now off HFNC, was on 10 L oxymask.

History of thymoma s/p VATS 2011 -outpatient follow up   Positive blood culture on admission, contaminant in 1 of 2 blood culture bottles. Repeat blood cultures showed no growth. Not on antibiotics   Associated attestation  - 04/22/2021 3:39 PM EDT   Formatting of this note might be different from the original. Patient seen and examined. Current status reviewed with resident staff. I have reviewed pertinent physician documentation, laboratory and radiographic data. I have initiated therapies based upon this reviewed  In brief 82-year-old woman with history of COPD, mediastinal mass status post VATS with benign thymoma with local recurrence presented with respiratory tract symptoms since 6 days prior to admission COVID testing is positive. In the emergency room she was noted be hypoxemic requiring 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations. She is currently on high-flow feels much improved.  I concur with exam as per Pulmonary fellow. Laboratories and imaging reviewed in detail.  Impression COVID-19 infection COVID-19 pneumonia Severe hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring high-flow oxygen Thrombocytopenia which is new since 2016 and a poor prognostic sign History of benign thymoma with local recurrence COPD with exacerbation Doubt bacterial pneumonia  Recommendation: Remdesavir 5 days Corticosteroids. Optimum dosing induration of corticosteroids has yet to be fully defined. Decadron 6 mg daily is reasonable however if develops progressive disease in the next 24 hr would escalate corticosteroids and would also add IL 6 inhibitor Additional minerals and vitamin supple role is unclear but probably benign If thrombocytopenia worsens may need alternative anticoagulation. Would check venous Dopplers Supplemental oxygen for saturations greater than 88% Daily PPI unless anticoagulation intensified then would go to q.12 hours Would favor discontinuing antibiotics

Per chart review, patient&#39;s husband reported spontaneous bruising of right arm and swelling after received 2nd dose of COVID vaccine, which eventually came down.   Repeat swelling occurred about 2 weeks prior to index admission, and was started on antibiotic for suspected cellulitis (cephalexin).  Also reports of spontaneous brusing, as well as one episode of bleeding/oozing.  At the ED, blood work revealed low hemoglobin (5.6) and PT 14.3, PTT &gt;120.  She was nasally intubated for airway protection.  She was transferred to our institution on 5/25/21 for hematology work up and evaluation.  Hematology evaluation is highly suspicious for acquired factor VIII inhibitor, and later confirmed with laboratory tests.   She received recombinant factor VIII replacement (Obizur) as well as Emicizumab, as well as rituxamab  for treatment acquired factor VIII inhibitor.  Patient current still hospitalized.

                                                The morning after I received the vaccine, I started feeling tired and my arm was quite sore. The following day, I had a fever of probably 100. I had chills and my heart rate and blood pressure went up. Since I have A-Fib, it was irregular. After several hours, my HR went back to normal and that is when I called my Cardiologist NP. She said that she thinks it&#39;s related to the fever I had. The next day, I felt a tad better, but fatigue and generally not feeling well lasted a few days. I feel that it took about a week before I felt normal again. About two months later, I was making plans to go out of town and I became very ill. I started having chills, fever, nausea and extreme fatigue. I may have taken some Tylenol. I was drinking a lot of water because I did not have an appetite. A couple days later I felt a little better so I did not contact my doctor, but I did go to an urgent care (05/22/2021) and had a COVID test. The test came back negative and I felt better two days later. On Monday, I started feeling bad again and I contacted my PCP, and I went to see him on Tuesday. He ran some blood tests and another COVID test, which came back negative. The fatigue just stayed around for quite some time. He monitored my sodium and chloride and they were both low so the doctor wanted them monitored. I was admitted into the hospital for two days. I was on liquid restriction. I had a bunch of tests ran that came back negative. I did have an AMA test which did come back positive. I am still on water restriction, but I am feeling much better. I&#39;m a bit leery about receiving a booster shot.

She saw her Primary Care Dr on  5/10/2021 after experiencing dizziness, fatigue, confusion.  She had lost a considerable amount of weight during this time and I was concerned and accompanied her to the doctor visit.  Dr prescribed cyanocobalamin B-12 as she had been defficient in her latest blood analysis on 3/15/2021.  She also added Donepezil 5mg tablet daily and trazodone 50 mg nightly to help with sleep.  She gave referral to get Neuroligical evaluation.  My mother had a driving episode on 4/30/2021 where she was taken to Medical Center and some Scans were taken of her brain that were apparently normal they contacted me to pick her up around 2:30 AM 5/01/2021.  The number on her release folder to obtain medical Records.  My mother was residing with me my home until her appointment for evaluation .  She passed away on 6/02/2021 in my home.. Dr  was contacted to sign off on her Death Certificate .  I have not received Death Certificate as of today but I believe the cause she was putting was Natural Causes due to age.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that an 82-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular in Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), at the age of 82-year-old, as single dose for covid-19 immunisation; adalimumab (HUMIRA), via subcutaneous from 2011 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) and ongoing, at 40 mg (1 in 2 wk) (40MG/0.4ML) for rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. Medical history included ulcerative colitis, control unspecified blood condition and heart issues. Concomitant medications included sulfasalazine taken for colitis ulcerative, start and stop date were not reported; prednisone taken for colitis ulcerative, start and stop date were not reported; folic acid taken for control unspecified blood condition, start and stop date were not reported; atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR) taken for heart issues, start and stop date were not reported; isosorbide taken for heart issues, start and stop date were not reported; losartan potassium (COZAAR) taken for heart issues, start and stop date were not reported; metoprolol taken for heart issues, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took the historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 81-year-old, in Jan2021 for covid-19 immunization. The patient experienced heart attack on 19Apr2021, groin hernia in Mar2021, lower extremity mass in Mar2021, acute haemorrhagic ulcerative colitis on 13Apr2021, diarrhea on 13Apr2021, bowel obstruction on Apr2021, fluid loss on 13Apr2021, arterial occlusion on 19Apr2021, hemorrhoids in Apr2021, postoperative pain in Apr2021. The patient hospitalized from 18Apr2021 to 25Apr2021 due to these events. It was reported that the patient with events of heart attack, groin hernia, big lump on groin, bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids and artery was blocked and non-serious possible hemorrhoids and postoperative pain with Humira  40mg/0.4ml (Adalimumab). In Mar2021, the patient experienced groin hernia and big lump on groin. In Apr2021, the patient experienced blockage in bowels, possible hemorrhoids and postoperative pain. On 13Apr2021, the patient experienced bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea and loss of fluids. On 19Apr2021, the patient experienced heart attack and artery was blocked. On 19Apr2021, the heart attack and artery was blocked resolved. On 20Apr2021, the diarrhea resolved. On 25Apr2021, the bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis resolved. In Apr2021, the groin hernia, big lump on groin, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids, possible hemorrhoids and postoperative pain resolved. Pfizer Biontech covid-19 vaccine (Tozinameran) was also considered suspect. Unknown stool softener also considered as suspect. In Mar2021, patient felt a big lump on her groin that was determined by physician as a hernia through physical examination and not an imaging test. On 09Apr2021 she had an outpatient surgery due to hernia in her groin. When she took acetaminophen as prescribed she had a blockage in her bowels and took unspecified stool softener which caused terrible diarrhea. On 16Apr2021 she went to the emergency room due to the diarrhea and had loss of fluids and just went home even when advised not to go home. On 18Apr2021 she was continued having diarrhea, she went back to the emergency room and had unspecified blood test that confirmed she was having a heart attack while on emergency room due to not taking her medications for the heart because was told not to take any medication while having diarrhea which she also temporarily interrupted her Humira while having diarrhea. Physician advised to admit patient to the hospital as she was told she was having a heart attack. On 19Apr2021, she had another stent because the artery was blocked from her previous stent. On 25Apr2021 she was discharged. She believed that her hospitalization was prolonged to nine days (as reported) due to she was bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative Colitis. She had a shot of covid 19 vaccine before at least one symptom happened therefore covid 19 vaccine was considered as co suspect product. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. On Jan2021, patient received first dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. On Feb2021, patient received second dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. The patient was treated with acetaminophen. The patient underwent other lab tests and procedures which included blood test: heart attack on 18Apr2021, laboratory test with unknown results in 2021. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events heart attack, Arterial occlusion/artery was blocked, Postoperative pain was recovered on 19Apr2021. The outcome of the event groin hernia, Lower extremity mass/big lump on her groin, Bowel obstruction, Fluid loss, Hemorrhoids was recovered in Apr2021; of the event Acute haemorrhagic ulcerative colitis was recovered on 25Apr2021; of the event Diarrhea was recovered on 20Apr2021.  The reporter&#39;s causality for the events of heart attack, groin hernia, big lump on groin, bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids, artery was blocked, possible hemorrhoids and post operative pain with humira 40mg/0.4ml (adalimumab) was no reasonable possibility.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with the BNT162B2 was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  Manufacturer opinion is that there is no reasonable possibility that the events of heart attack, groin hernia, big lump on groin, bleeding a lot as a complication of ulcerative colitis, diarrhea, blockage in bowels, loss of fluids, artery was blocked, possible hemorrhoids and post operative pain are related to humira 40mg/0.4ml(adalimumab).   No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                After 2nd vaccination - patient was having trouble breathing whenever she worked out in the yard doing minor task such as raking leaves/gumballs.  She had 3 or more episodes of feeling light-headed and stopping activity and walking into living room and sitting.  Was able to catch breath and didn&#39;t want to go to hospital in any of these cases.  However on March 8 at 3pm, she felt light-headed but on her way back to her living room, her breathing was disrupted.  Her breaths were cut short and she was not receiving much air into her lungs.  The breaths were shorter and shorter until she wasn&#39;t receiving hardly any air into her lungs. Her face turned blue.  She passed out.  She had CPR administered about 30 seconds after passing out.  Ambulance arrived about 1 minute after passing out.  EMT crew worked on her for 18 minutes and was ready to contact coroner when they got a heartbeat.  She was taken to hospital on March 8.  She was transferred to another hospital later than night.  She was sent home for hospice (still unconscious) on March 16 or 17. She passed morning of March 19.  Death certificate states cause of death was lack of oxygen to the brain, but no determination was made to what caused her breathing problems, which caused the lack of oxygen to her brain.  EMT crew said her symptoms were very similar to blood clot in lungs. Hospital ruled out a blood clot.  They also downloaded data from the pacemaker and ruled out A-Fib as the cause.  Pacemaker data had indicated a mild event around 3pm on March 8 and sent a shock to her heart but nothing unusual.  I believe the hospital also ruled out another cause or two, but never did determine the cause.

Per her hospital admission note, she stated that she felt fine, stood up, became dizzy and was able to lower herself to her chair then went unresponsive for a few minutes, but did regain consciousness. When she arrived to the emergency department, she was in atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate in the 140-150s. While the AFib is long standing, the RVR is new and potentially unexplainable. This was resolved with cardizem drip ending at 2220 on 01/25/2021.   Alternatively, this patient is being put into VAERS as there are 2 other patients hospitalized with cardiac issues and received vaccine from the same pharmacy with the same lot number.

Patients troponin level then elevated and it was determined patient was having a NSTEMI.  1/24/21- patient had recurrent episodes of SVT and family decided patient would benefit from further cardiac workup so she was transferred to a higher level of care. Unknown if patient has discharge from the facility we transferred her to.  This patient is felt to be of significance since she is 1/3 patients currently in our facility who developed cardiac/blood issues post vaccination from the same pharmacy with the same lot number vaccine. VAERS reports were put in for all three to determine if further investigation is needed.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

They x-rayed leg and found nothing  unusual for a woman my age.  Then they conducted a scan and discovered a blood clot behind my knee.  Since then, I have had intermittent pain. The Doctor referred me to a hematologist which I will see this week.  Prior to the vaccination have never had a blood clot.  It occurred three days after the vaccination.  Coincidence?  I think not.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

My mother had a stroke, several seizure and her lungs were filled with blood clots. She had to have a procedure to remove the largest one next to her heart. My mother has always been healthy and has never had any of the following issues in her life. She gets regular checkup and I spoke with her on April 19, 2021 at 12:00pm Central time and she was fine but at 1:20pm my brother who is staying at her house said she was having a seizure. I talk to my mother at least four times a day and she has never in 83yrs experienced anything like this. She doesn?t remember right now where her shot was administered but my brother took her but he is mad at me because I have full power of attorney and he is not happy. Therefore, he will not give me the information that is needEd to give to your office. My mother was admitted to the ICU. She is now at their rehab center in a hospital.  Once my mother is released from the hospital she is moving with me out of state. This is and unexpected expense that I will need assistance with but I don?t mind because it is my mother and now someone has to be with her 24/7.

An 83-year-old female patient (5 feet 1 inches, about 120 pounds) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6198, patient was not sure) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Feb2021 (83-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose; the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (83-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she has got both the shots of Pfizer (Covid-19 vaccine) and at the end of the first one or it is like eighteen days, just before the second shot, something happened with her knee and it has just got worse (from 12Mar2021). She did not connect that with the Pfizer shot and I was thinking maybe it is a pulled muscle or something but it is very bad now. She would like to know what she can do. Also, she is thinking may be blood clot at this point and she would like to have it checked. She thinks that she should be able to contact somebody to actually get some physical test on this. She tried heat and cold alternate and Absorbine Jr. and Aspirin. It varied with the days, she thinks she has taken Aspirin about twice a day and it is a tablet and it was 325 mg and she took two of those, orally. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included &#34;heat and cold alternate and Absorbine Jr. and Aspirin&#34;. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE),  via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose (at the age of 83-years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included the patient had known allergies (unspecified) and unspecified chronic health conditions from an unknown date.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient was not pregnant. The patient received unspecified concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 15Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough. The events resulted in emergency room visit and the patient was hospitalized (from an unknown date) for the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough for 6 days. The clinical course is as follows: 2 or 3 weeks after the patient got the vaccine she started getting out of breath when she walked. Each day she got worse. Then the patient was taken to the hospital where they discovered the patient had three blood clots. The clots were in the patient&#39;s leg, heart and lung. The patient stated the Doctors do not understand where the clots came from. The patient was in the hospital 6 days. The patient stated they are still having breathing problem and still on oxygen as needed and they still cough at night. The patient asked if there have been any other reports of this happening to other people who got the vaccine as the patient never had blood clots before this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (nasal swab): negative on 15Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough and included blood thinners and oxygen therapy and complete bed rest. The clinical outcome of the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                STROKE; Facial droop; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.  An 83-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), dose 2 intramuscular on 02Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EM9809) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation; and carbidopa, levodopa (DUOPA), via percutaneous j-tube from 2018 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) and ongoing, at unspecified dose for advanced parkinson&#39;s disease.  Medical history included maternal history of strokes, and paternal history of strokes, both on unspecified dates. Concomitant medication included carbidopa, levodopa taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. Historical vaccination included first dose of BNT162B2 on 20Jan2021, intramuscular, with lot number: EL19261 for covid-19 immunization.  The patient experienced stroke on Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, and facial droop on Apr2021 with outcome of recovering. Details were reported as follows: The patient felt like she experienced a mini stroke in Apr 2021. She had her Peg and J tube replaced on 16Apr2021 because they came completely out. Her husband was not sure if the pump was working states he could not saw the medication. Her husband had the pump disconnected from her. NCM advised her husband to run the pump over paper towels. Her husband did as instructed and could then saw the medication. He then connected patient to the pump and the pump ran without any error codes or alarms. Her husband wanted to make sure patient did not need a new pump since she got new tubing. NCM assured that the current pump seemed to be working fine with the new tubing. She left sided mouth droop in Apr 2021. She was taken to the local hospital via emergency medical services (EMS). She was then transferred to Hospital in for evaluation. She was in the ER awaiting a bed for 20 hours. The primary reporter did not know if any tests or medicine obtained as he did not receive any paperwork. After 20 hours, she was discharged from the ER home. She had a brain waves test a few days later to confirm if stroke had occurred. The primary reporter stated he did not feel the COVID vaccine was related to he events of Mouth droop and possible stroke. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included brain waves test: results pending on 21Apr2021.  The action taken in response to the event(s) for bnt162b2 was not applicable, and for carbidopa, levodopa was dose not changed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information provided, considering the age and medical history of the patient, the event stroke is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event &#34;facial drop&#34; is assessed as symptom of the event stroke, hence not related to BNT162B2 either. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Six days after the second dose of Pfizer I started experiencing shortness of breath so I went to the ER and took a chest x-ray and had fluid in my lungs. Doctors discovered I had Atrial Fibrillation. In January I had an Echo Cardiogram and none of the previous described diagnoses were present then. I was admitted; doctors attempted to shock my heart back into rhythm several times but were unsuccessful. Therefore, I was put on Eliquis (5mg) and a water pill to get rid of the fluid in my lungs (and swollen ankles). I was hospitalized for 9 days where I was evaluated through numerous tests. Eventually it was suggested that I undergo the Watchman&#39;s Procedure to get off blood thinners. Everything went well with that surgery on Thursday May 20th; complications arose after the surgery: heart rate and blood pressure spike, lungs started filling up with fluid. Ended up in ICU for four days. I still have a problem with my lungs despite having no history of lung problems and I am now dealing with AFIB. This all started 6 days after my second shot.

                                                Pneumonia; Disease progression; They found a 9cm mass on her liver.; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer Sponsored Program. A contactable pharmacist and Other Health Professional reported that an 83-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at the age of 83-year-old, at single dose for covid-19 immunisation; palbociclib (IBRANCE, Film-coated tablet, strength 100 mg), via an unspecified route of administration from 24Jul2020 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) to 30May2021, at 100 mg for an unspecified indication. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported patient stopped the palbociclib a few days ago. It was notified on 25Jun2021 Friday. Patient was home hospice now. She had pneumonia after her COVID vaccine a month ago and then when she went on for her scans they found a 9cm mass on her liver. So the doctor decided to stop palbociclib as a sign of disease progression and she was declared home hospice. There was no hospitalization. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included scan: found a 9cm mass on her liver in 2021. The action taken in response to the events for palbociclib was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and the limited information available, the causal association between the event pneumonia and the suspect products palbociclib and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

                                                3/13/21 Ferrell ER to admission hpi: 84 y.o. female presented to the emergency room with complaints of back pain, nausea, and abdominal pain.  Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

A non-pregnant 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 84-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidaemia (HLD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM2). Concomitant medications included regular prescribed medications for HTN, HLD, DM2 (drugs unspecified). No other vaccines prior to four weeks. Known allergies were unknown. No COVID prior to vaccination. Covid test post vaccination in May2021 was negative. The patient had no acute issues prior to her 1st COVID vaccine. In Apr2021, the started experiencing progressive weakness and poor appetite to the point of hardly being able to walk. The patient saw her primary doctor who ran some blood work and noticed she was dehydrated with mild elevated liver enzymes and WBC count. The patient was admitted to the hospital (for 21 days) for IV fluids and was on oral antibiotics. The patient started having some SOB and scans done indicated possible lung infection. The patient was switched to IV meropenem which did not help. The doctors also noted some lesions on her liver and a small mass in her lung (no biopsy was done cause she declined) which they said were suspicious for cancer. The patient then suffered a large ischemic stroke and she passed about a week later. The patient was feeling well before her vaccine and everything started to go downhill after her vaccine. AEs result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent covid test: negative in May2021. The outcome of events weakness, decreased appetite, unable to walk, dehydration, elevated liver enzymes, white blood cell count increased, short of breath, lung infection, hepatic lesion, lung mass, and lung cancer was unknown. The patient died on 27May2021 due to ischemic stroke and infection. An autopsy was not performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information  and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported suspicion on malignancy and BNT162B2 use is  unrelated while the causal relationship between the remaining events and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded. There is limited information available which precludes a more meaningful assessment. However, the underlying conditions and the age of the patient maybe risk factors.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate; Reported Cause(s) of Death: ischemic stroke; infection

A 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EW0167), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 26APR2021 at the 84 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The medical history was ongoing high blood pressure, pain and allergic.  The concomitant medications were none. The patient states she goes to the doctor for a checkup for almost 1 year but she cant go because she wasn&#39;t able to go anymore because of corona virus and she didn&#39;t go out to visit her doctor for almost one year. The patient states she has high blood pressure, but she doesn&#39;t have medicine, it was diagnosed a long time ago because the doctor said take this medicine but she wasn&#39;t able to get a checkup and wasn&#39;t able to get the medicine so she doesn&#39;t have medicine. The patient would like to report a terrible effect on herself by the Pfizer vaccine. The patient states she had her first vaccine 26APR2021 and after that she had chest pain on 27APR2021  that lasted for the next day and almost 2 days and then her arm was also numb on 27APR2021  and she just put some hot and cold compress on her chest and she just rested and it just went away, but last week the same thing, her chest became painful and she saw this number about the Covid 19 and that&#39;s why she&#39;s calling, what should she do should she get the second vaccine? The patient states she did not report to anybody yet, this is her first time. The patient states last week, it came back again and then on the next day 27APR2021, it was very deep and painful in her knees, both sides, left and right above her knees. The patient states yes, sometimes its very painful. The patient states not now, but last week the pain was in her chest and she put a cold compress on it. The patient states after the numb and pain, its not like pain, its deep pain, that&#39;s why she&#39;s bothered. The patient states it&#39;s really serious, the knees, because of clotting or whatever so she tried to rub some alcohol on her leg, that&#39;s what she did. Chest Pain; very deep and painful in her knees: The patient states it&#39;s slowly not pain, it&#39;s not very painful like before, the first and second time that it occurred. The patient states it&#39;s pain, but it&#39;s like better, it&#39;s getting better. The patient states she cannot say that it&#39;s recovered, she feels a little better. The patient confirms it is ongoing and it is persisting. The patient states it&#39;s not worsening, she just feels it sometimes then it goes away if she massage it or applies pain ointment.Chest Pain: The patient states her chest is painful, the left side of her chest is very painful. The patient states she doesn&#39;t like to receive it because she said she might be allergic because sometimes she&#39;s really allergic, but all her friends said she needs to go now, she will be protected and of course she knows that like from the flu vaccine so she searched before she was able to see and she was going to get Moderna so she said she would look for a nearer place near her and so her friend told her to go to pharmacy because she has friends there that would help her and she went there and she got the Pfizer vaccine. The patient states that&#39;s because she did not have the pain before that for a long time for many years and now after getting the vaccine, now, she experienced it. All of the events were assessed as Medically significant. The adverse events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office.Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks), there was no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The reporter considered the events were all related to Pfizer Covid 19 Vaccine. The outcome of the event was Numbness of upper extremities was not recovered ,the others was Recovering.   The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal association, a causal association between suspect drug and the reported events cannot be completely excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 85-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELO140, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm (deltoid; unknown side) on 23Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2017 and ongoing, high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) from 2019 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was administered first dose of the COVID vaccine on 23Dec2020 and then was swabbed for COVID on 26Dec2020, and then on 28Dec2020 her PCR swab was positive for COVID. She was asymptomatic until she started complaining of leg pain. She ordered an ultrasound for the patient on 30Dec2020, and it confirmed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in left leg. The patient was being treated with anticoagulant apixaban (ELIQUIS) currently. Caller stated that this could be that it (DVT) is from COVID, but her real question was, could it be from the vaccine? In Pfizer&#39;s information packet for patients, there is section on what to tell your provider prior to getting vaccinated. One of the things on there is if you have a bleeding disorder or are on an anticoagulant. There is no explanation as to why it was in the packet of information. Caller has looked everywhere and can not figure out why that is on the FAQ/packet information. The patient was due for the second dose on 13Jan2020, but she was worried and hesitant to approve it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020, ultrasound of the left leg: confirmed DVT on 30Dec2020. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event &#34;COVID test (PCR swab): positive&#34; is related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The event occurred 3 days after vaccination, when vaccine was not expected to achieve the effect.  The event DVT of legs is not considered related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The patient had underlying diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, which are considered as risk factors for DVT.

An 85-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included dementia. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient popped hot 02Jan2021 along with 4 others on the hall she lived. Within 9 days 50&#43; patients were positive. All had the vaccine the same day. Patient was test positive on 02Jan2021. She was on day 12 of her quarantine when she started to get worse. She was unresponsive by 16Jan2021 and passed 18Jan2021. We were with her from 14Jan2021 to 18Jan2021. But had not been allowed to visit with her since Mar2020. And what post treatment pairs well with it? Publicly we hear Remdesivir and Bamlanivimab but these patients only received a general antibiotic and some vitamins. Death cause was Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan2021. No autopsy was performed.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported event of positive for corona virus infection for the lack of efficacy of the vaccine. However, based on the mechanism of action of the vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine is given. Case will be reevaluated based on follow-up information; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

Everything was normal before that. The atrial fibrillation started last week. She decided to wait another week to see what happened. Then yesterday, the atrial fibrillation started again with all sort of swiggles. Her watch shows afib or inconsistency. It has been off the wall yesterday and today. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The health department put up a screen on their website for people 80 and over so she signed up. She goes to the doctor this Thursday. She has diabetes, but it was under control. She takes insulin and Humalog for extra coverage. Her blood sugars have steadily been higher than normal. She took her heart rate on and off last week. It was over a couple of days. Her heart rate was erratic, but not as much as yesterday and today on an unspecified date in Feb2021. Her blood sugar was steady in 160s where it was normally lower in the 120s, 130s, and 140s on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The outcome was not recovered for atrial fibrillation, and unknown for erratic heart rate and blood sugar levels increased.    No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

There was no option to leave a message for a return call to share what I feel is important safety information.

An 85-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0162), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 10Apr2021 at the age of 85-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing arthritis and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient reported that she was not taking anything for arthritis, just some Tylenol once in a while over the counter (it was not prescription). The patient was taking an inhaler for COPD. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), administered in left upper arm on 20Mar2021 at the age of 85-years-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced bladder infection and viral infection. The patient got the first Pfizer vaccine on 20Mar2021 and was alright for a few days afterwards. Then all of a sudden, she started getting infections on 28Mar2021, 8 days after she had the first vaccine. She got a real bad bladder infection then she went to the doctor and she got medication for that. She was with bladder infection then she came down with the viral infection. The patient reported that she has not even been going anywhere because of the virus and she has been staying home. She just goes to the grocery store and clinic to the doctor, that was it. The patient had an antibiotic for the bladder infection. Sulfamethoxazole was the name of the medication that was for bladder infection. They didn&#39;t give the medication for the viral infection. The patient reported that it was just a viral infection, it was not the Covid. Since then, she had her second dose of the vaccine on 10Apr2021 and from an unspecified date in 2021, her foot started, her foot swelled up and she didn&#39;t know. She takes lot of retention pills, so she thought maybe it was that. So she took her pills and everything and washed and start getting but the next day instead of the foot going down, the swelling went up to her leg and then the next day it went all away up to her hip. The swelling on the left side from the foot all away up to the hip. She went to urgent care on 21Apr2021 (reported as &#34;21st&#34;) and saw a doctor and she was tested and she had blood clots. Regarding lab test, the patient reported she had two infections and then she got the blood clot that was from her hip all the way down to her left leg to her ankle. She could not figure out that they called the test and what they tested. But they had a lab work done then one has a test, veins, and everything. She can&#39;t remember. The patient reported that her foot and her leg was swelled, her toes all over up to her leg swelled. She had a fat foot and a fat leg just one side. She would say since she has started taking medicines for that, she took the first dose at the evening of 21st (21Apr2021), the day she went to the urgent care, and she would say it was not any worse. The medication was supposed to break up the blood clot, but it was the big one from her hip all the way down to her foot. Just a little bit better. The outcome of the events was recovering.

These apparently were not unusual symptoms for her to feel intermittently.  Per her niece, who has a home O2 sat device, her 02 sat that morning was 97 with a HR of 87 irregularly irregular.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Same day as when patient received the 2nd vaccine, she was overcome with generalized fatigue and nausea.  By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ? Word finding difficulty; without stroke or acute abnormal on CT or MRI; according to the Hospital

This 86 years old female patient received the second single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EN6203) on 04Mar2021 at 11:00, in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were administered on the same date. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 vaccine intramuscular, on 11Feb2021 at 18:30 (lot EN6201). The patient received some years ago an unspecified pneumonia vaccine and an unspecified tetanus vaccine experiencing after both headache, swollen arm and rash. She didn&#39;t react to the flu vaccine. Her body didn&#39;t want any more vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, maybe a week or two after the second vaccination, early to mid afternoon, the patient had what felt like a charley horse in her lower leg while walking, but didn&#39;t pay any attention to it, just put ice on the leg. She then got sciatica in her leg on 24Apr2021 and couldn&#39;t walk; that was what sent her to the hospital as it was getting worse and she went to the hospital because of the pain. She just ignored it for at least a week but she was still having pain after the second week and could hardly walk due to the sciatica in that leg. At the hospital they found she had a blood clot in the calf of her leg on 28Apr2021. She was hospitalized from 28Apr2021 to 02May2021. The doctors in the hospital recommended that she should report her experience even though they didn&#39;t know if it was due to the COVID vaccine due to the proximity. The hospital doctors took care of her but her primary care provider knew that she had been in the hospital. The doctors gave her medications in the hospital that helped the pain in her foot and the sciatica but her lower leg/calf still hurt so they decided to do an ultrasound and found a blood clot. The patient still had to give herself injections in the belly for blood thinner to treat the blood clot. The patient also experienced soreness in arm on an unspecified date in 2021. Sciatica required ER visit. Blood clot was resolving. The other events outcome was unknown. The doctor said that there was a possibility that the blood clot could be related to the COVID vaccine, but it may not be related at all.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, including a prolonged onset latency of nearly two months, it appears unlikely that BNT162B2 contributed to the reported events. These are likely intercurrent medical conditions in this elderly patient. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of additional information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) :PFIZER INC-2021501847 same patient/drug, different vaccine dose/AE

On routine admission test, pt tested positive for COVID-19, after previously having both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine on 2/3/2021 and 2/24/2021.  Notes from provider: &#34;2. Covid 19 &#43; despite Pfizer vaccination 2/2021 - possibly related to her MGUS and inadequate immune response, though her son (whom she lives with and has been homeless in the past) has not been vaccinated, so possibly either failure of immune response with true Covid19 infection vs false &#43; due to exposure to son (he is planning on being tested). Continue dexamethasone and remdesivir given oxygen requirements and standard lab monitoring.  3. Acute hypoxic respiratory failure - continue Rx for Covid19 with dex/remdesivir and ceftri/azith for possible CAP, will also increase IV lasix given findings on TTE today. &#34;

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.

An 88-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Mar2021 at the age of 87 years old (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as the 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in 2021, the patient had a touch of pneumonia, used inhalers, and cleared up. The patient was hospitalized for the event &#34;a touch of pneumonia&#34; on an unspecified date. The reporter stated that they were still trying to get the second shot, and it&#39;s been 8 weeks and 3 days. The reporter was asking if there would be worse side effects after getting 3 doses, if they did get the second dose as a first dose. The reporter was referred to their doctor or health care provider for further guidance, since they were the most familiar with their medical condition. The patient recovered from the event &#34;a touch of pneumonia&#34; on an unspecified date in 2021. The reporter stated that the pneumonia did not have anything to do with the shot she got, but it was after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the event of pneumonia.  The reported event likely represent intercurrent medical condition. There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon arrival, she observed that my mother was disoriented and her vision was impaired. Specifically, her right pupil was completely off to the right side, her eye was irritated and slightly swollen. Per recommendation from the primary care office, my mother was taken to the emergency room. She remained hospitalized for two weeks during which time, several labs and x-rays were performed; several ideas surfaced regarding root cause including Miller Fisher Syndrome, mini-stroke, etc. but no final diagnosis was identified.

The fatigue is their primary concern, as this is so profound she will fall asleep on the toilet or even in the middle of getting dressed.  Appetite is decreased, but she denies N/V/D.  She feels &#34;chilled&#34;, but no known fevers, no rigors/sweats.  Cough is occasionally productive of sputum, mostly clear but sometimes with small &#34;chunks&#34;; no hemoptysis.  No LE edema.  No HA or changes in taste/smell.  No known sick contacts, but patient has exposure to multiple daughters who help care for her, and she has been attending church recently.  Urine is dark/strong, but she denies dysuria.   Pt has received both doses of COVID-19 vaccine, second dose on 3/17/21.   Hospital Course:    Patient was admitted to medical floor for COVID-19 infection and urinary tract infection.  Patient had a very mild course of illness.  Decadron was started but patient did not require any remdesivir.  Patient has remained at her seen home oxygen requirement.  Patient was seen by PT and OT services for generalized weakness.  Blood cultures have been negative.  Patient is medically stable for discharge home today.  She will need another 2 days of antibiotics treatment for urinary tract infection.  Since her respiratory status has been very stable, we have chosen to discontinue the use of Decadron upon discharge to avoid any changes in mental status induced by steroids in an elderly patient.  Home health services and remote monitoring kit have been ordered at the time of discharge.   I have called patient&#39;s daughter  to provide update that patient is coming home today and answered her questions

Later the daughter admitted that she had had increased weaknesss and confusion for a few weeks.  She was seen in her PCP&#39;s office and diagnosed with a UTI and gout.  The x-ray of her knee later showed a fracture of her proximal tibia.    A few days later she was brought to the emergency department with a wide complex tachycardia and acute coronary syndrome.  She had an 11 day stay complicated with congestive heart failure, hypoxia, aspiration pneumonia and metabolic encpehalopathy.    Her daughter thinks that this was brought on by the vaccine, and asked us to fill out a vaers.

                                                2 months after last dose, a routine bloodwork revealed high kidney numbers. Voice became hoarse and difficulty in swallowing ease was noted. Repeat blood work confirmed kidney numbers still high after hydration, IV fluids given at home. Fatigue increased and I took my mother to the ER.  She was admitted and she spent 3 weeks in the hospital, 1 week in ICU. She was eventually diagnosed with the autoimmune disease ANCA Vasculitis. Biopsy confirmed. No previous kidney disease or abnormal blood work. She was treated with high dose steroids and  chemotherapy.  There was no positive response to treatment. Condition worsened and she was moved to Hospice care. My mother died on 05/16/2021

She is on a blood thinner and it  made the levels change and set off her A-fib .  The next 3 days she had body pain.  Her leg strength has weakened.   It has been over a month and she is not back to the levels of health she had before the second shot.  I also notice she rambles in conversation.

                                                presumed cardiac failure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. An 89-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9261), intramuscular at arm left on 10Feb2021 (at the age of 89 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, presence of prosthetic heart valve and allergies, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate/benazepril hydrochloride, amlodipine, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN E.C.), atorvastatin, benazepril, carvedilol, ubidecarenone (COQ10), furosemide, acetaminophen and potassium chloride. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142), intramuscular at arm left on 20Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced presumed cardiac failure on 12Feb2021 at 03:30 with fatal outcome. The patient died on 12Feb2021.  An autopsy was not performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the event Cardiac failure is most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug BNT162B2. The patient medical history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia provide plausible explanations for the event.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: presumed cardiac failure

                                                89 yo female with PMH HTN and hepatitis B was COVID19&#43; on 2/2/2021.  On 2/20/21, patient received a first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID19 vaccine 30 mcg/0.3 mL IM x 1 (lot# EL9261; left arm). Was seen in ED c/o back pain and bruising.  On admission Platelets=3k and Hgb=8.6.  Patient treated for Evans syndrome: ITP and hemolytic anemia. Patient received 1 units platelets, IVIG 55gm IV daily x 2 days, Rituximab 560mg IV weekly x 4 (1 dose given during this admission), dexamethasone 40mg IV x 4 days followed by a prednisone taper. Per hematology, &#34;spontaneous development of warm atuimmune hemolytic anemia as well as ITP is of unclear etiology. No malignancy has been isolated. There are some rare case reorts of ITP from COVID vaccination. Ultimately, we cannot prove whether this is due to the COVID vaccine.&#34;  Patient was counseled to not undergo the second dose of COVID vaccine.

An 89-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.The patient experienced autoimmune (Coombs positive) hemolytic anemia as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura in Mar2021 with outcome of recovered in 2021.  The patient was hospitalized for both events from 2021 to an unknown date. The patient received Prednisone, IVIG as treatment. The events also resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care and considered as Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported autoimmune (Coombs positive) hemolytic anemia as well as idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be assessed further upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and investigators, as appropriate.
