A 76-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number EL3247), intramuscular on 19Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included COVID symptoms from 16Jan2021 and ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient with acute resp failure, COVID pneumonia, that developed symptoms 9 days prior to admit and ultimately received first vaccine 6 days prior to a admit, then shortly after progressed with other covid symptoms and was admitted on 25Jan2021. She decompensated while intp and was transferred to ICU for rising O2 needs, ultimately had to be intubated. Became hypotensive due to massive hamatoma 2&#39; bleeding into abd rectus muscle. Sx and IR consulted and did beside exploration of hematoma. Initially blood pressure responded but overnight continued with refractory hypotension. Maxed out vasopressin and levophed, hemodynamics deteriorated. The patient died on 02Feb2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events death, COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, abdominal wall haematoma and abdominal wall haemorrhage cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pt passed soon after

                                                DEATH-My Mother received her second Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, February 18, 2021 and died three days later on Sunday, February 21, 2021, after being admitted to the intensive care unit at  Hospital.  After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.  Instead of the massive all call for vaccinations, we need further information and data from additional studies that will give more insight as to when the vaccine can cause more harm than good, as in My Mother?s case.

This consumer reported for a 76-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) who received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL3302) first dose via unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at 12:00 PM in left arm at single dose for COVID-19 Immunization in the hospital. There was no other vaccine administered in four weeks. Medical history included COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), Small Cell Lung Carcinoma with metastases to brain s/p surgery, chemotherapy and radiation in 2014, dementia. Concomitant medications included citalopram at 40mg, levothyroxine at 0.05 mg, salbutamol (ALBUTEROL). The patient previously took Codeine and experienced allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. The patient had what appeared to be a stroke on Saturday, 23Jan2021 at 12:00 PM. A CT, MRI and an Echocardiogram were all performed on 23Jan2021 and there was no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, midline shift, or extra-axial fluid collection. Extensive FLAIR hyperintense signal signal in the cerebral white matter. Mild hyperintense signal in the brain stem and medial cerebellum. Following contrast administration there is no abnormal CNS enhancement. The adverse events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization for seven days from Jan2021. Treatment given was TPA to reverse adverse effects. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of events was recovered/resolved with sequel.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 17Mar2021 13:50 (at 76-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. Medical history included hip replacement four years ago in 2017 (First right then 2 months later left) and knee replacement six years ago in 2015 (both 2 months apart). There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6203), administered in Left Arm on 25Feb2021 (at 76-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced bad headaches. The patient received the second dose of vaccine on 17Mar2021. On 29Mar2021, she was not hurting and went to brunch with friends. Afterwards (on the same date, 29Mar2021), she was sitting and got the worst pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. She drove herself home but was in such misery. She went to the emergency room the next day, on 30Mar2021, wherein she had a CT (computerized tomography) scan that showed a blood clot in her lower abdominal area. She was taking pain medication every 6 hours, or she could hardly stand it. On 08Apr2021, she went back to the emergency room because she could hardly stand it. She was kept in observation status but was not admitted. She was scheduled to have another CT scan on 06May2021. She is not sure what they will do because the nerves are wrapped around it. She also mentioned that her doctor wants to do a biopsy. The pain was also running down to her ankle. She stated that she has had both of her hips replaced in the past. She added that her doctor will do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). He will put in a drain if it has not shrunk. The doctor can&#39;t do anything because the nerves are all tangled up (2021). As corrective treatment, the patient was taking pain medication for the blood clot and pain through her side that ran down her left leg and to her ankle. Outcome of nerves are all tangled up was unknown, while outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 76-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Mar2021 (lot number: EP7534) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), irritable bowel syndrome described as a condition where you&#39;re in the bathroom a lot, fibromyalgia, little depression, heartburn, upset stomach, heart fluttering issues, congestion spray (nasal congestion), and had part of a lung taken out. Family medical history included heart issues (dad and uncle). Concomitant medications included salbutamol (VENTOLINE [SALBUTAMOL]) for asthma; venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR) for little depression; pantoprazole for heartburn and upset stomach; fluticasone propionate (lot number: AA47468, expiration date: Aug2020) for congestion spray (nasal congestion); fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) for heart fluttering issues. The patient previously took SHINGRIX (also reported as shingles vaccine, for clarification) for immunization and first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200) on 25Feb2021 (age: 76 years) in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunization.

They were also taking blood every 4 hours (unknown results). The provided diagnosis was arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG (Mar2021). The events cannot rule out anterior infarct and abnormal EKG, butterflies in the chest that went to quivering, A-Fib/Arterial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulted in emergency room visit and physician office visit and let to hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized from 2021 to an unknown date (also reported for 2 days, for clarification). It also gave her A-Fib, trouble breathing and now her heart rate is screwed up (Mar2021).

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date in Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthmatic, had double pneumonia years ago, has ongoing atrial fibrillation and a pacemaker to control it as the only problem she has in her heart. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient was hospitalized for 2.5 days after having symptoms of a massive heart attack two days after the vaccine. It was reported that two days post vaccination, the patient was rushed to the hospital by ambulance as they thought she was having a massive heart attack. She added her symptoms lasted for hours, she had pain so bad that she was bent over and had a little trouble breathing. She said the pain was in the heart and underneath the rib, on the left side. She later mentioned she did not feel like it was AFib. She said they did every test possible and listed the following ones: ultrasound, stress test, x-ray (unknown results), and blood work in Feb2021. She specified that her blood work indicated a blood clot. She mentioned she was told by her personal friend, who was a doctor, that by having the shot sometimes it indicated you have blood clots when you really don&#39;t. The patient also specified that she broke out in a sweat, the pain was so severe that she  could not bend over and could not get up; therefore, they treated her as if she was having a massive heart attack for 12 hours at the hospital. It was reported that they kept giving her stuff to stop the effect with her heart.  She mentioned her second dose was scheduled on 25Feb2021. She asked if her experience was reported as a side effect to the vaccine and should she get the second dose of the vaccine. She explained the doctors did not know what she had, and she needed to determine if she can receive the second dose. She also asked if we could notify her if a similar reaction is reported. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

Medical history included chronic migraines all her life. She said her migraines have let up as she has gotten older. She also had an irregular heart rate before, saying her irregular heart rate started in her adult life. She said she considered herself more of a &#34;carrier&#34; for an irregular heart rate because her irregular heart rate doesn&#39;t happen enough for her to think about it. She said she doesn&#39;t have an irregular heart rate now. She said her father had a pacemaker &amp; her 2 brothers had heart problems; her oldest brother passed away from his heart problems &amp; her other brother has blood pressure issues. Patient also had mild asthma as an adult. She said she worked at (name) in a dusty environment, and lived near a landfill, where a lot of her neighbors have gotten sick. She said she needs an inhaler for her asthma. She said when she needs the inhaler, she takes 3-4 puffs at a time. She said she doesn&#39;t use the inhaler every day and also mentioned that her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. No previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date of vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced an atrial fibrillation in which she started racing and couldn&#39;t breathe. She mentioned that she recently attended a funeral but attributed the symptoms as side effects of the vaccine. She was taken to the Emergency room where she was given cortisone and resolved her symptoms. Patient also further  reported she had side effects with the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. She clarified she had her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 04Feb2021. She said her side effects happened less than 14 days after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient thought her side effects from the COVID-19 Vaccine may have been anxiety within. She said her nephew had died of COVID-19, and when she was at his funeral at the graveside, she flipped out while she was at her nephew&#39;s funeral, she was not doing good. She said she has a history of chronic migraines, and mild asthma. She said she had to lean against a gravestone because she couldn&#39;t breath.

She said she left her nephew&#39;s graveside and went to an urgent care. She said the doctor at the urgent care had done an EKG result abnormal, and told her she needed to go to the Emergency Room right away. She said the doctor had called the paramedics to transport her from the urgent care to the Emergency Room at (Institute name). She said she did not have any pain, but had a hard time breathing. She said she may have been scared because her grandfather had died of a bad asthma attack. She said she has chronic migraines, but what she had at the time was a mild headache, and not a migraine. She said she has not smell or taste a lot of the time. She clarified she has had no smell or taste for a while, saying she would not be able to tell if she got the COVID-19 Virus because of her loss of taste and smell.

She said she has had a total of four COVID-19 Virus tests before, and all her COVID-19 Virus tests have been negative. She clarified she did not have a COVID-19 Virus test while she was at the ER on Saturday, 13Feb2021. With her nephew&#39;s death, getting her COVID-19 Vaccine had left her mind. She said it didn&#39;t dawn on her until she settled down, and she thought her high heart rate and irregular heart beat were side effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she read the paperwork that was given to her at the time she got the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said the side effects listed for the COVID-19 Vaccine is what she had, a very fast heart beat, and it was very hard for her to breath. She said the Emergency Room doctor didn&#39;t think to ask her about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she panicked when she got to the hospital. She said she didn&#39;t even know that someone had drew blood from her. She said someone put a label on her, and told her the label was to show blood was drawn from her.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscularly on 20Jan2021 12:30 at single dose in right arm to prevent covid. Vaccination Facility Type was Health department. Medical history included rotator cuff challenge. There were no concomitant medications. No other vaccine was administered on the same date. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks and no adverse events were following prior vaccinations. Patient was calling about Pfizer Covid vaccine. She had the first shot on 20Jan2021. She did not have a reaction. She went to go get her monthly massage on Saturday (23Jan2021). On Sunday morning (24Jan2021) she started to feel ill and she had to go the hospital. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital. She had chills, aches and pains, it felt like an elephant was on her chest, she had chest spasms, a fever a little shy of 101. She went to hospital and the doctor there told her she had covid since she had all the symptoms. She confirmed she did not have covid and had a negative covid test. She had chest x-ray and an EKG since she thought she was having a heart attack. Reported her massage was primarily on her left shoulder, it was a deep massage on that area since she had a rotator cuff challenge, massage was focused on that shoulder. She was thinking that the vaccine activated all that discomfort since she felt it from the left part of shoulder, went down to her chest like a v, and back up to her right shoulder. Every time she took a breath she had a chest spasm and it was hard to breathe. The events required a visit to emergency room. For treatment, they gave her medication to take called robaxin, it was an anti-spasm, and 800mg of ibuprofen. She took robaxin Sunday night, Monday, and she took one on Tuesday since she was feeling better. She was sensitive to medication. She felt dizzy and nausea from Robaxin. The patient had recovered from the events completely by Wednesday on 27Jan2021. She had a reminder to return for the second dose on 10Feb2021. She was asking if she should get the second dose.   Information about Batch/Lot number has been requested.

The next day she was more lethargic, coughing.  Called her PCP, recommended Robitussin and Mucinex which she took.  Continued to feel worse.  No fever although she had cold sweats.

                                                She had been in her usual state of health until tonight. Assisted living facility staff called. He mentioned that the facility staff had earlier noticed that she was dragging her right foot and and has been needing more assistance with activities. The patient was walking and did not feel well. She was lowered to the ground and had a witnessed cardiac arrest. The ambulance was called and she was reportedly found to have pulseless electrical activity. She was given Epinephrine and Amiodarone with return of pulse. The patient was brought to the Emergency Room and was evaluated by ER physician. EKG showed atrial fibrillation, ventricular rate = 66, RBBB with Brugada pattern. She was emergently brought to the Cath Lab. Cardiac catheterization showed normal coronary arteries but EF 35-40%. Repeat EKG showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response = 110, RBBB. Therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. The patient was admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation with TV 350 RR 14 PEEP 5. She is sedated with Propofol and Fentanyl IV. She is on Levophed IV. ABG showed pH = 7.22, pCO2 = 53, pO2 = 66, O2 sat = 88%. Lactate level = 9.5. WBC 8.8, Hgb 13.4, Hct 46, Platelets 138. Na 138, K 3.2, Cl 102, bicarb 20, BUN 16, Crea 1.19, estimated GFR = 44 mL/minute. Magnesium 2.7. Glucose levels have ranged from 273-312. Pro-Calcitonin = 0.26. Albumin 3.7. SGOT 262, SGPT 294. Troponin elevated at 47. Pro-BNP = 600. Urinalysis showed large blood. Chest x-ray showed vague peripheral pneumonitis. Endotracheal tube is in place. COVID-19 test by PCR is negative (2/5/21).    COURSE IN HOSPITAL  The patient was admitted to the ICU and was followed by Pulmonary/Critical Care.  Patient was maintained on mechanical ventilation, sedated with propofol and fentanyl IV.  Vasopressors were administered (Levophed IV).  She was managed with therapeutic hypothermia.  She was followed by Cardiology.  Foley catheter was inserted for close input/output monitoring.  Neuro checks, vital signs, daily weights, pulse oximetry, cardiac telemetry and fingersticks were monitored.  She was given sodium bicarbonate IV due to metabolic acidosis.  She was also given insulin IV drip.  Potassium chloride IV was administered due to hypokalemia.  The patient was given amiodarone IV.  Platelet count was noted to be low but stable.  Glucose levels were within acceptable range.  Metabolic acidosis resolved.  Hypokalemia resolved.  Hypomagnesemia resolved.  There were elevated LFTs which improved.  Elevated CPK also improved.  She was taken off hypothermia protocol.  Sedation was decreased and she was able to open her eyes with verbal stimulus but unable to follow commands.  Ammonia level was normal.  Neurology evaluated the patient.  EEG showed left periodic epileptiform discharges consistent with severe diffuse encephalopathy.  Chest x-ray revealed right upper lung and left mid lung increasing opacity for which meropenem IV was started.  Levophed was discontinued.  Initially she had peripheral cyanosis, but this resolved upon discontinuation of vasopressors.  Brain MRI was done demonstrating diffuse bilateral small and moderate-sized ischemic foci throughout the cerebellum and cerebellar region suggestive of embolism.  There also was chronic marked atrophy and moderate small-vessel gliosis.  CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING DEMISE  Based on neurologic evaluation, her prognosis for meaningful neurologic recovery was thought to be extremely poor.  The patient was evaluated and followed by Palliative Care. She does not have family members and had designated her neighbor friends as her power of attorney. They have known the patient for a ling time and they know that she does not want to live like this. A decision was therefore made for comfort care measures only. Compassionate extubation was performed on February 12, 2021. The patient passed away on February 12, 2021, at 6:39 p.m.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 25Mar2021 10:00 (batch/lot number EP6955 and expiry date not reported) at 77 years of age as single dose for covid-19 immunization in a clinic facility and not in military facility. Medical history included Stroke from 2014 and another in Dec2018; the patient had MRI to confirm, ongoing blood thinner (therapy).

The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Mar2021 at 77 year of age for covid-19 immunization and experienced arm soreness, Eliquis for 2.5 years after the first stroke for blood thinner and couldn&#39;t deal with Eliquis very well and made her feel like she was dying. The patient had no prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 30Mar2021, the patient experienced TIA (transient ischaemic attack). The patient informed that at first she had nothing then five days after the second dose (30Mar2021), she had a TIA. The TIA that she experienced was so sudden and so alarming. It affected her balance and walking (unspecified date). The patient informed that when she was walking to pick up a stick she felt out of balance. The patient was walking like she was a drunken sailor and was staggering. It was the oddest thing. The patient has not talked to her doctor. The TIA was quick then it was gone. It was scary. The patient did not seek treatment (no treatment received). The outcome of the event TIA was recovered on 30Mar2021, while unknown for the rest of the events. The patient considered that the TIA may have had nothing to do with the shot, it happened 5 days later.

A 77-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose via an unspecified route of administration on 08Mar2021 15:30 (3:30 PM) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hashimottos (reported as hoshimottos) Diagnosed 35 years ago, hypermobile Diagnosed 20 years ago, and disorder nomia Diagnosed 25 years ago; all unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); diazepam (VALIUM); and levothyroxine (LEVOTHYROXINE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took bnt162b2 on 15Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization first dose at the left arm and experienced immobile for a day, cannot walk, weakness and sore arm. The patient was to know if there is going to be a booster for the Pfizer covid vaccine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer covid vaccine both doses and she is calling to report the reaction she had with the first and second dose to help other patients, she said she was close to death after the second dose. In the middle of the night she was awaken due to excruciating pain in the body, like truck ran over her. The patient heard that someone had same reaction who was in the hospital, with similar symptoms to covid. She said she felt like if her internal organ were shutting down. She does not do well with the antibiotic, and does not go to the doctors. She could not walk or eat after the second dose. She said she has hashimoto dysautonomia hypermobility. she said she thinks she might have had anaphylactic reaction. The patient added that she has lived through it and her experience has been very unusual. The caller has underlying conditions that may have caused this event, she received the second dose on 08Mar2021, it was a horrible experience but since she is still alive she would want to report it. The caller does have strange reactions to chemicals and she typically goes to naturopaths and holistic doctors because of this. The caller also has multiple autoimmune disorders and feels like that may have played a part in this reaction. It was added that further added that she received her second dose 08Mar2021 at 3:30pm and had a little bit of a sore arm, she was thinking positive thoughts about all of this because she never gets vaccines. At 2:00am on 09Mar2021 the caller was awaken in excruciating pain, every surgery she has had or accident manifests in the greatest pain. The pain was excruciating the caller took over the counter pain medicine and diclofenac and it didn&#39;t help. The caller is unsure of what she took, she may be making this up. The caller felt like she was dying, she felt like her internal organs were shutting down, it happened all week. The caller was so weak her husband fed her and made sure she was drinking. The caller thinks she would die if she had to have a booster shot of this vaccine. The caller has never had anaphylactic shock, could this have been anaphylactic shock? All of the pain from a surgery all occurred at once and her entire body was wrecking, in horrible pain, that she does not think heroin could have taken care of. After the second vaccine she was literally so weak that she felt like all of her vital organs were shutting down and it lasted for 6 days, like she got hit by a truck, like had beat her up. The caller knows that there are new found reactions with (Company name) and they stopped thousands of doses because of it, she saw this in the news today. The patient wanted to make note that she has underlying autoimmune diseases, she is unsure if there is a correlation between this and her reaction. The caller was changing from her thyroid medicine and her thyroid went very high with the generic brand so she was swapped to Synthroid in the middle of this. The caller was on levothyroxine and it wasn&#39;t working, her thyroid was sky high (Unknown lot number and expiration date Feb2022). The caller was going through all of these changes as well when she received the vaccine. The caller&#39;s doctor took a test and the caller has antibodies and they are there but not very strong. The caller doesn&#39;t want to be spreading something because she is feeling healthy and fine today. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She was wandering if she had the Pfizer vaccine a week after the stress test. She got it at the university, and she wandered if they were restricted to give it to her a few days after my scheduled date: They wanted to rule out blockage in her heart.  She was having a test done around the same time as the 2nd Pfizer vaccine. She wanted to know if she could get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine later/ a week after the stress test. She wanted the vaccine, it was important. On 04May21 she was going to have a dye based test checking your heart, a stress test. The stress test was scheduled the same morning as her 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She was advised to consult with your doctor or pharmacist for further guidance.

                                                At approximately 930am I arrived at Memory Care.  I met with the director of the facility and she directed me to where my team would be setting up.  My team consisted of (technician), (nurse) and I. As we were setting up, the director asked how she can help. I explained to her that we would need a designated area for patients to be monitored after vaccination for 15 minutes and maybe even longer . I also explained that we would need one of her staff monitoring while we vaccinate. She agreed, and proceeded to designate her staff and the cafeteria area, facing the vaccination station,the monitoring station.   Throughout the day, nurse and I were both vaccinating,while the staff of the facility would monitor the vaccinated patients. I would also stop occasionally to mix the vaccine and check the temperature of the aero safe.   At approximately 12:50pm, the director rushed in and stated that a patient is not responding, and that she had been vaccinated. At that point, I grabbed epipens and a thermometer and I also instructed nurse to grab an Epipen and come with me. We followed the director to pt&#39;s room. Once we got to the room, the patient was in bed and there were 4 staff members standing bedside and one of them turned and stated the patient has passed. At that point I asked the staff how long ago did the patient get the vaccine, they stated about 30 minutes ago. They also stated that the patient was a hospice patient and that the patient had declined, and was rapidly detiorating and had not eaten or drank anything all day . They also stated that the patient had been monitored for 15 minutes post vaccination. I then left the room and grabbed the patients COVID Vaccine intake consent form.     I looked at the answered questionaire and all the responses were circled NO. Patient had a temp of 96.5 at the time of vaccination.The vaccine administration information for Immunizer Section was filled out by Nurse. I then proceeded to ask the director once again if there were staff that was monitoring her for 15 minutes, the director stated they had staff monitoring her. She also stated the Hospice nurse has to announce her death, so they waited for the Hospice Nurse to come.  I then called Corporate and explained the situation. After speaking to corporate, I also asked nurse, if she remembered the patient. She stated that she did and at the time of the vaccination the patient was not alert, there were two staff members with the patient. She was non oriented and she kept closing her eyes. At that point, Nurse stated that she asked the two staff members with her if this is how she usually is and if its ok to vaccinate her. Both Staff members stated that it its ok,this is how she is. The Nurse then proceeded to vaccinate.  At approximately 3:10pm, as I was leaving I spoke to the director, and one of her Staff members. Staff that the patient has actually not eaten/ or drank anything for the past several days, including today(01/18/21). Staff also stated that on Friday, Jan 15th,2021, they had informed the family that the patient was rapidly detiorating. Staff also stated that the family knowingly gave the consent to vaccinate her. She also stated that the hospice Nurse believes that the death was primarily caused by her detiorating state. She also stated that the hospice Nurse informed that the death was not due to the Vaccine. Per Lead Pharmacist at the clinic.

A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 16:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included kidney ablation (ablation on the kidney cancer 5 years ago), kidney cancer, blood pressure, neuropathy, pain, had a urinary tract infection 19Dec2020 and they saw the cancer came back, radiologist read the CAT Scan and said the size of the tumor 1.5 to 2.4. Concomitant medications included acebutolol for blood pressure taking for years, diclofenac for neuropathy using for 10 years, oxycodone for pain taking 19 years; all ongoing, and oxycodone hydrochloride (OXYCONTIN) for pain. Patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Family Medical History was none. The caller stated that he was not sure if the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have given patient (his wife) COVID-19 or not. He also stated that when they received their vaccines the facility was very crowded as was the hospital when the wife was getting her blood work done so he was not sure when or where she contracted COVID-19. On 29Jan2021, patient was very busy running several errands including going to the hospital for bloodwork and a nuclear medicine injection as part of a work up for kidney ablation that the patient was supposed to have completed, patient was in the process of getting ready to have an ablation on her kidney and had the nuclear scan for her kidneys and then went to get a COVID test. After they got home, patient sat down at the computer and she started to act funny, kind of quiet and not talking which was unusual for her. So at about 1700PM the husband went in to ask her what kind of music she would like and he found her unconscious in the chair. He took her blood pressure and it was 60 over 4; with no heart rate; she was just barely breathing, he could tell by the way her mouth moved. He tried to breath for her, all of the sudden she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. He called (phone number provided) and they rushed her to the hospital, and the paramedics verified her heart was not beating and they started to do resuscitation. Then they finally pulled her out of the chair and put her on the floor and she started to breath. When they took her to the ambulance she was still not quite coherent; she didn&#39;t know what was happening. She was taken to the hospital emergency room and stayed there for 12 hours and they monitored her with an EKG and only saw one spike for 6 seconds. They discharged her on 30Jan2021 afternoon and she has been totally normal 100 percent since then. Since she had been home she had been doing well and has had no other events. Added patient had never had a heart problem before. Caller stated that he was not sure if this event was related to her receiving the vaccine or not. Now they had to stay in quarantine 10 days until 08Feb2021 since the COVID test given at the hospital on 29Jan2021 night when she went in was positive. Patient was scheduled to received the second shot 18Feb2021. Outcome of events unconscious, no heart rate, pressure was 60 over 4 was recovered on 29Jan2021, events started to act funny and stopped breathing was recovered on 30Jan2021, outcome of other events was unknown. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, patient was taken to the ER and monitored for 12 hours but no admission. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect.

                                                At location, she felt fine during 15min wait At 3:30-4:30 Zoom call, she looked good, but said she wasn?t feeling great &amp; was concerned due to chills &amp; 4days headaches after 1st dose At 8:30pm she called with chills, 3 layers of clothes &amp; bedwarmer on... said her teeth chattered &amp; was trying to drink warm water to heat from the inside (hydration w/o cold water; said no more coffee) At 11:00pm she texted chills were over, she was expecting aches ?but would be asleep during them?... good attitude at the time At 2:19am she called, had fallen &amp; couldn?t get up, said she called a friend to come help her ... said she?d tried to get up, but legs were numb... said she was dizzy when she fell, total dry mouth &amp; had reached for water, but it spilled when she knocked into things when she fell.  She wondered if she should call Fire Dept (but wasn?t making total sense).  Her friend came, tried to help, but I think she decided to call 911 for help getting her up &amp; wants EMTs to check her out.  **She had fallen during Covid, went to ER &amp; they gave fluids &amp; she was ?good? for a week, but then dizzy &amp; severe lethargy, same friend took her to ER &amp; she was admitted (negative covid test at that point), but very large PE, thus heparin &amp; then Eliquis (Dec 2020).

Caller said she had her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shot 25Feb2021, then two weeks later her blood pressure was sky high and she couldn&#39;t walk and she went to the emergency room and they said that she was almost having a stroke. She said she was admitted 11Mar2021 and stayed until this past Sunday which was 14Mar2021. She hadn&#39;t seen her primary care provider (PCP) yet she only saw the doctor at the hospital. She was supposed to go back on 18Mar to get her second shot, so she wanted to know if it was gonna be safe. Caller said that she has recovered, and when she came home, she was a little dizzy, but they gave her a medication for vertigo and right now she was ok. Outcome of the events was recovered in Mar2021.

                                                Pneumonia after getting the COVID Vaccine; Pneumonia was related to MRSA; Very weak; mild fever; This is spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s husband). A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 78-years-old, administered in arm on 25Feb2021 15:45 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus from 2011 (Verbatim: Diabetic; Diagnosed 10 years ago), rheumatoid arthritis from 1995 (Verbatim: Rheumatoid arthritis; Diagnosed in 1995), cardiac failure congestive from Oct2020 (Verbatim: Congestive Heart Failure), adrenal insufficiency from 1990 (Verbatim: Adrenal insufficiency; Diagnosed in probably 1990), atrial fibrillation from 2017 (Verbatim: Atrial fibrillation; Diagnosed 4 years ago). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications (&#34;she takes lots of medications. Too long of list she probably takes 15 different medications, reporter chose not to provide them). No-other vaccines were given at the same time. She gets the flu vaccine every year, shingles vaccines, pneumonia vaccines every year but, has no idea where they were manufactured. Confirmed she did not get the listed vaccines at the same time she got the COVID Vaccine. The patient&#39;s husband and the patient (his wife) both received their 1st COVID shot on the 25Feb2021 and was scheduled for 3 weeks later. He got his COVID on the 18Mar2021. The patient got Pneumonia and was admitted to the hospital but he does not know the exact time the Pneumonia started. It developed over a period of several day started with a mild fever (in Mar2021) and after the 2nd or 3rd day her fever spiked and that&#39;s when she was admitted to the hospital. He reports his wife went into the hospital with Pneumonia on 18Mar2021, the day she was supposed to get the 2nd shot. It was also reported that Pneumonia was related to MRSA. She laid up in the hospital for 2 weeks, the weakness (&#34;very weak&#34;) may have happened in the hospital or a few days before, date was confirmed to be on 15Mar2021. The event &#34;pneumonia&#34; was totally unrelated to COVID and now she is in a nursing home, she went in on 26Mar2021. She probably won&#39;t be able to have the 2nd shot for a couple of weeks. She was in there for a couple of weeks and still quarantined. He wanted to know will the fact that she is not getting the 2nd shot at the 3-week interval reduce the efficacy of the vaccine since she is getting the 2nd dose late. Does it make a difference with the effectiveness of the vaccine if she&#39;s going take the 2nd dose 3-4 weeks or even a month and a half rather than the usual 21 days interval? No treatment before going to the hospital other than calling the doctor and the doctor saying take her to the hospital (not reported if patient received treatment during hospital stay). No treatment done over the weekend, while she was in the nursing home. The adverse event pneumonia required a visit to Emergency Room. The patient was hospitalized from 18Mar2021 to 26Mar2021. Investigations included had a lot of blood work done, a CT scan, an X-ray on unspecified dates. He does not have any of the results but, the physicians have them. The outcome of the event mild fever was unknown, for very weak was not recovered while for the rest of the events was recovered on 26Mar2021.

A 79-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine; Batch/lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration injection to right upper arm  on 22Jan2021 14:00 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing she was a fainter (She was a fainter, she just faints so she has a hard time getting shots. Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine administered to her by nurse while she was in her car seat. She just asked the nurse to let her lay down in the car seat when injection was administered so that if she fainted she would not fall far; she was still getting the wash cloth on her head preparing when the Nurse had already finished administering the injection.); ongoing depressed sometimes (she was depressed sometimes, was stressed. She was the primary caregiver for her 96 year old mother. She had seen something about stress and COVID and shots and everything); ongoing  Very tired (She was almost 80 years old so she was very tired often.

Concomitant medication included Levothyroxine at 100mcg taken once daily in the morning early before she eats with Start date unknown, but at least 10-15 years ago for Thyroid. Enalapril at 10mg taken once daily (Caller initially reported product name as Vasotec, but clarified it is not Vasotec, it is drop for eye cataract and glaucoma) for High blood pressure. Brimonidine with Strength unknown, 1 drop in both eyes twice daily, started maybe 1 year ago. Specified cataract and glaucoma in left eye; but drop was administered to both eyes; and left eye was eye affected by Bell&#39;s palsy for Cataract and glaucoma in left eye. The patient previously took codeine and experienced allergy with onset maybe about 50 years ago, she was not sure; occurred during dental procedure; had bad headaches but no lasting effects so they assumed allergy to codeine; she did not know if still has allergy but says she does if asked.

A 79-year-old female patient received bnt162b2(Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL9284, Expiration date: 31May2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 11Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 11Feb2021 7pm, patient went to get something to open the can of soup but when she went into the pantry, she lost part of her vision and it only lasted for three to four minutes. The patient&#39;s daughter who is a neurologist thought it was the mini stroke or TIA (Feb2021). The doctor was setting up the sonogram for her arteries and her neck and also for her heart and said she might have to rely on a pacemaker. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events. She was scheduled for second dose on 11Mar2021, but she is scared because of events that occurred 01Mar2021. The outcome of the events diarrhea, &#34;Nose running&#34;, &#34;Her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34;, &#34;her calf muscles were so tight it hurt&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

A non-pregnant 80-year-old female patient received two doses of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, the first dose in 2020 and the second dose on 22Dec2020 11:00, both at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included heart, diabetes, obesity.  There were no concomitant medications.  The patient did not have covid prior to vaccination.  The patient contracted COVID on 04Jan2021 11:00. The patient was hospitalized for COVID-19 for 8 days.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included: Nasal Swab: negative on 24Dec2020, negative on 28Dec2020, negative on 31Dec2020, positive on 04Jan2021.  Unspecified therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event.  The outcome of patient contracted COVID was fatal.  The patient died on 12Jan2021.  It was unknown if an autopsy was performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: patient contracted COVID

Abdominal pain complaints increased and continued, she decompensated rapidly, was intubated and subsequently died 3 days later.  Imaging results showed, progressive ovarian cancer in the bowels.  Blood culture revealed that she had E.Coli in her blood.  It is thought that this is NOT related to the vaccine.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

Evaluated by her primary care provider on 2/26 AM and the ER at Hospital on 2/26 PM.  Noted to have chills, nausea and vomiting in the ER. Also noted to have tachycardia, likely related to her atrial fibrillation. She had been unable to take her home medications due to vomiting and had missed her rate controlling medications. She was given IV Zofran and Tylenol with good control of her chills and vomiting.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

                                                bleeding from ileostomy; abdominal pain; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist. An 80-years-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number and expiration date unknown), intramuscular on 28Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Iodine, Levaquin and Morphine and experienced allergies. It was unknown if the patient received other vaccines in four weeks. The patient experienced abdominal pain and bleeding from ileostomy on 01Mar2021 at 11:00PM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available the events abdominal pain and bleeding from ileostomy are attributed to intercurrent medical conditions that were not related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).

An 80-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200; Expiration Date: 06May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included insomnia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient weight was 155 now. Patient was overweight because this eating and eating. Feeling inactive, not going out so patient gained a lot of weight. Patient took blood pressure medication and for heart some basically and patient didn&#39;t sleep well, so patient took Alprazolam to relax to sleep, but patient was an insomniac but that was basically problem. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included isosorbide. Patient had the first Pfizer shot and wasn&#39;t even sore or anything, patient was so happy but that about 4 or 5 hours later about maybe 5 o&#39;Clock, patient had allergic reaction and started to feel a sensation in lip and when she looked in the mirror, what was all that on lip and one side on lip it had turned white and it had lump was extended along lip line, lymph node was swelling up and patient had white lumps on lip which still had but it was going down and some white patches on face. Nothing happened on the 24Feb2021. Patient thought it was the 25Feb2021 that was when all trouble started. Patient felt like nightmare because she started feeling like something was choking her in mouth and next minute patient started coughing, coughing real hard and that was terrible cough then after this strange voice and patient realized it was breathing and it was like somebody has cranky paper in hand which screaming up that&#39;s what breath sounded like. Patient start to get out of bed and then waken to kitchen, patient had terrible headache, joint pain, pain all over from head to foot and patient was certainly dehydrated. She had no water in at all, she was like don&#39;t know something come over and felt like she was sort of leaving the world, patient was like fainting, and panicked. Patient had terrible pains all over and felt like patient was dying, patient was going to die. Patient said she need an ambulance, patient was very ill and had to be taken to hospital. They came within a few minutes, they started questioning about what was happening and they put patient to the emergency room and well they test patient for Covid as well naturally. It was negative, they did it 2 times and it was negative. When they took patient to one of the room in fact patient was frightened because they didn&#39;t told patient it was negative. Patient said she got the virus, they said not but patient had to take the oxygen as it&#39;s surge to scan on lungs. They said patient had allergic reaction to the vaccine. Patient was supposed to have it but at the same time there was the variant, doctor said patient was 70% covered, didn&#39;t have it but patient want to just check the status was with a person like her was allergic. Patient had shots in face and patient did tell them that she had all sorts of things on face. Now patient still had the white lips and couple of patches around mouth and naturally patient was worried like what to do. The patient didn&#39;t take the second shot because she was too nervous. Patient went hospitalization on the 25Feb2021 very early, and was relieved on 27Feb2021 (not sure). Reason of Hospitalization: On the University hospital. They put down to the Pfizer injection but that was older happens to patient, they infused patient with antibiotic they gave pills. Patient said she won&#39;t be able breath with them and that was what they did, they &#39;reflect&#39; her, they said patient had pneumonia which she did not have (Further clarification was unknown). Early the next morning they put patient down 2&#39; o&#39;clock in the morning. Patient wanted to go home, they said patient can&#39;t as she had very bad infection in lungs which was completely untrue. The next morning (the same morning early), patient was okay because the pains and everything was gone but she believe the medication they put patient on that caused to short of breath and patient said please don&#39;t give her the medication and they did. They only give generic medicine in the hospital and patient took brand name. On 26Feb2021 patient actually called the doctor for all results and she told nothing, patient didn&#39;t get the result. Anyway they took patient off one medication, they didn&#39;t give it to her and this medication you can not get off of it and through that patient had a headache the whole of the day and the whole day on the 26Feb2021 patient was suffering with very bad headache and kept asking for the medication they said they would give to the patient. Finally the doctor gave only to the aspirin and paracetamol (TYLENOL) that both the same and in the end patient husband have to go and get the pill because they still hadn&#39;t given it to patient all day long. Patient said to doctor because she was breathing hard and she said the doctor did this to her by giving these pills that don&#39;t agree with her. She told she can not take this medication, anyway the doctor said to patient husband go home and get her medication, and he said so now you are medicating yourself. By the next day patient was ready, she was breathing normally and was ready to go home but late afternoon they said patient should go home but she still had those white patches but they were not as prominent as what they were. Patient whole lip turn white, whatever they did, whatever they gave, patient had sore around mouth and face swollen up. Patient didn&#39;t know whether she was allergic to the medicine or what but her face, it looked like she had, patient was fine anyway couldn&#39;t get an appointment with GP to the Wednesday (unspecified week) but it free appointment on the Tuesday and patient went in and showed him what it looked like. He said it should return to normal within 2 weeks and it but still face like normally excepted lips. Outcome of events pain, short of breath was recovered in 2021, and outcome of other events was unknown. Date of second shot was 17Mar2021, it was reported patient had got the both shot of covid vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021404239 similar report from same reporter

                                                The morning after Mom&#39;s first dose of the Pfizer shot, Dad woke up and found Mom lying on the floor next to the bed.  Mom said, &#34;I can&#39;t move my arm.&#34; Dad called paramedics who checked her.  They said her vital signs were normal and left.  On 2/9/21 in the morning my da awoke to see that Mom had large amounts of bubbly saliva pouring from her mouth onto her pillow.  Dad called paramedics, who said this was a diabetic reaction.  Mom had NEVER had anything happen like this before.  Mom was very sleepy, could not be aroused, and made only gurgling noises.  She was admitted to the hospital for care and therapy.  She pulled her own IV out.  Mom had to be restrained in the hospital and sedated, due to confusion and worsening dementia.  By 2/18 when we spoke by phone mom&#39;s speech was abnormally slow and very repetitive.  &#34;I&#39;m very tired today&#34; was spoken many times.  In morning time mom was able to follow basic conversation.  Not so later in the day.  Mom came home from rehab on 2/26/21.  She was able to walk steadily and independently at home after her therapy.  After a week or so, Mom began hitting the in-home caregiver.  Dad&#39;s presence would calm her.  In a short time Mom seemed not to know dad anymore, and would hit him and the caregiver when they helped her.  She also pulled all covers off the bed and pulled clothes out of the closet, throwing them all over the room during the night.  Mom was usually walking around the house during each night.  On 4/16/21 Mom and dad were napping sitting up on the couch in the morning.  Mom fell forward and hit her head on the hearth.  Dad and caregiver gave first aid and called paramedics, who took her to the ER.  Mom came home on 4/17/21.  On 4/18/21 Mom pulled her catheter out in the early morning.  In the afternoon Mom&#39;s appearance was concerning, so Dad called paramedics.  They said that Mom&#39;s BP had dropped very low and took her to the ER. Mom was combative the next day in the hospital.  Dr. adjusted her medications periodically to ensure that mom&#39;s care would be manageable when she would eventually be sent home.  Minimal therapy was done due to dementia.  By 5/3/21 doctor said that Mom is bed bound and needing total care.  Her blood sugar spiked high despite special diet.  Staff waiting for insulin order from doctor.  5/4/21 Doctor called Dad to say that Mom had died during the night.

                                                Bleeding/felt blood on her arm /blood was coming from the top of the band aid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reporting for self. This 81-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EL3248) via unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 02:00 PM at right arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, clopidogrel (manufacturer: Aurobindo, lot# QR7520022-A, expiry date: Apr2022) oral from Dec2020 at 75 mg once a day for TIA (Transient ischaemic attack). Medical history included TIA from Aug2019. She had her first TIA Aug2019, and then had her second a couple months ago, it was not as severe, the buildings moved and she walked like she was drunk, but had only one other thing than walking funny and buildings moving, she can&#39;t remember what that was. Pain, blood cholesterol abnormal.  Pain in both of her arms, she said her left arm hurt more than her right arm from time to time, and when the left started hurting she took all the pills, but she didn&#39;t take Hydrocodone though it is prescribed, she didn&#39;t take that unless she was in a lot more pain than usual. She said her doctors said different things about her arm pain, one said she had a torn rotator cuff, another said arthritis, someone else said it was something in her neck but it was a big word that she didn&#39;t know, she just knew she had pain. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN, manufacturer: Bayer, UPC number: 349483 48150) from Aug2019 for TIA; carbamazepine from Jan2021 for pain in both of her arms; metoprolol succinate, had been taking it a couple years; zolpidem; hydrocodone for pain (she only takes if she is dying of pain, clarified to being in a lot of pain); atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient reported that she had COVID-19 and experienced side effect. She said it happened after the 15 minutes observation when she left to drive home on 14Jan2021. She said 5 minutes into her drive she felt blood on her arm and put her hand in her shirt, and wiped it, saw blood. She said the bleeding was weird so she pulled over to look at her arm, and blood was coming from the top of the band aid where normally it would seep down from the bottom. She used five baby wipe, and wiped a lot of blood, until finally she thought it stopped bleeding. She was not light headed or in pain, it was a 45 minute drive and she got home and was still bleeding so she took her shirt off and put a towel around it to stop the bleeding and it finally stopped. She said she didn&#39;t think to report it until her doctor said to when she told him, he had said maybe the girl who gave her the shot hit a vein, but she should tell them. She said maybe she did hit a vein, because she had never had problems when getting a shot or more than a spot of blood in the past. She said one thing that may be important was that she had a couple of TIAs, many series (unable to clarify) her doctor friend assessed that with three MRIs and MRAs. She said she just refilled one of her medications, Clopidogrel, and was reading the instructions for it and it says it can cause excessive bleeding. She said that she was not bleeding so she didn&#39;t worry about it, that maybe that caused excessive bleeding.  She had not had a second dose, but she didn&#39;t want to go through this again with the bleeding, though if it was just a vein or air that may not happen. She said she was very healthy, no underlying conditions at all, never had a problem before, her arm was not painful, she was not light headed. She said the baby wipe she had on her arm after the car ride was full of blood, and she still couldn&#39;t get the band aid off, so she wrapped her arm towel kept sopping up blood until finally it quit. She put another band aid over the bloody band aid, and it quit and she was fine. She had no injection site pain, no tiredness, no headache. Lab data included she had MRIs and MRAs, but there was no bleeding. The action taken for clopidogrel was unknown. The outcome of event was recovered.

On 1/12/21  I received a call from the nursing home that my mom had stopped eating and drinking and that she had nothing to eat or drink for 3 days. I asked them why they didn&#39;t call me sooner but they did not have an answer. I was told to come in because she was very lethargic and possible dehydrated.  They tested her for Covid the morning of 1/12/21 and she tested negative.  I went into see my mom and she was barely conscious.  They gave her fluids intravenously but it had no positive affect on her condition.  On 1/14/21 she tested positive for covid and was moved to their covid unit.  I called in Hospice comfort care on 1/15/21.  My. mom died on 1/17/21.

                                                Heart attack; Asthma attacks; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (the patient). An 82-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 16Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from an unknown date (she has had Asthma for about 14-15 years), broke back from an unknown date (she broke her back about 3 years ago); stent placement from an unknown date (she had 2 heart stents placed about 2 years ago), and then she said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 16Mar2021. She said she would really like to know if the COVID-19 Vaccine possibly caused her to have the worse asthma attack she ever had in her life on 17Mar2021. She clarified she was talking to her friend on the telephone when she had her asthma attack at 3:30PM. She said that on 18Mar2021 at 5:00AM, she had a second asthma attack. She said her second asthma attack was not as bad as the one she had on 17Mar2021. For her first asthma attack on 17Mar2021, she took 2 puffs from her inhaler, and then an additional 2 puffs (4 puffs total). She said her doctor told her if she had a bad asthma attack, she could take 2 more puffs from the inhaler. She said she normally takes 2 puffs from her inhaler. She said for her second asthma attack on 18Mar2021 she took only 2 puffs from her inhaler. After she took her 2 puffs from her ProAir HFA Albuterol Sulfate inhaler, she flopped back into her bed. She reported she normally has 3-4 asthma attacks a year. She reported that her doctor did a complete blood workup on 03Mar2021 and told her she was doing just lovely. The patient also reported she had a very mild heart attack and she can&#39;t even take low dose aspirin. The patient also reported she had another question about the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was allergic to a couple of fairly common medicines (statins and NSAIDs) and wanted to know if anything in the list of the COVID-19 Vaccine ingredients would indicate her having a possible allergy to the vaccine. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room and/or Physician Office. The outcome of the event asthma attack was recovering, and for the heart attack was unknown.

                                                4/10/21 ER HPI: 82 y.o. female who presents to the Emergency Department by paramedics from a local nursing home.  The patient is an 82-year-old female with a known history of end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.  She presented to the emergency room after being transported from a local nursing home.  Apparently, the patient was acting a little bit more confused than normal and she was looking more short of breath than normal.  The nursing home nurse stated that her oxygen saturations were in the upper 80s without oxygen and the patient looked visibly more short of breath than normal.  Because of this, the nursing home made the decision to send the patient in.  When paramedics arrived at the nursing home they placed 2 L of oxygen on her and her oxygen saturations went up into the high 90s.  The patient does dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She did not miss a dialysis treatment this week.  The patient has had her coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine and several months ago did have coronavirus (COVID-19) at the local nursing home.  The patient does have mild dementia and so is somewhat of an unreliable historian.  Transferred to pleural effusion

A 82-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 at the age of 82-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient took the shot at the regional vaccination center and she had an appointment of course set up by her doctor, but they don&#39;t have any specific name. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure and atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medication included metoprolol taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that his/her mother experienced a reaction after having the shot. She took the shot on 12Mar2021 and suffered from atrial fibrillation and she has not had atrial fibrillation in over 13 months and once she took the shot on the very next day (13Mar2021) she had atrial fibrillation which lasted about two and a half day. They went to her heart doctor and they checked her out and they said that other people that had taken the vaccine had experience the same thing so, the reporter was calling to see if that was something Pfizer has heard before or not. It was reported that the patient was scheduled to take the second shot this coming Friday and after speaking with her doctor they indicated to go ahead and take the second shot but again the reporter wanted to report this because the reporter knew the company was keeping a record of this information. It was reported that the patient was about 5 feet 7 inches and probably 140 pounds. The outcome of the event was recovered on 15Mar2021.

Per her hospital admission note, she stated that she felt fine, stood up, became dizzy and was able to lower herself to her chair then went unresponsive for a few minutes, but did regain consciousness. When she arrived to the emergency department, she was in atrial fibrillation with RVR with rate in the 140-150s. While the AFib is long standing, the RVR is new and potentially unexplainable. This was resolved with cardizem drip ending at 2220 on 01/25/2021.   Alternatively, this patient is being put into VAERS as there are 2 other patients hospitalized with cardiac issues and received vaccine from the same pharmacy with the same lot number.

Patients troponin level then elevated and it was determined patient was having a NSTEMI.  1/24/21- patient had recurrent episodes of SVT and family decided patient would benefit from further cardiac workup so she was transferred to a higher level of care.

This patient is felt to be of significance since she is 1/3 patients currently in our facility who developed cardiac/blood issues post vaccination from the same pharmacy with the same lot number vaccine. VAERS reports were put in for all three to determine if further investigation is needed.

                                                My mom received the Covid 19 vaccine on Jan 5, 2021 and became very about a week later. I was informed that she tested positive for Covid 19 on January 14th. One January 17th she became very tired and weak and would not eat. Hospice called me and told me that she was in a decline state. I saw her on January 25 and 26 and she was just sleeping and could not open her eyes. Her vitals were good and she seemed to understand when I talked to her - she would squeeze my hand and moan but she could not talk or open her eyes. My mom passed away on January 27, 2021 just 22 days after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine. She was very think to begin with and being to weak and tired  to eat resulted in her losing even more weight. Some of the other residents were given fluids to help and they recovered. My mom was not given fluids. I believe there were 20 deaths in her care home for the month of January when they vaccinated. This was an alarming number of deaths for the home. The facility had very few Covid deaths in 2019 and 2020. I asked every week if they had any Covid and or Covid deaths and this amount was shocking to me and the workers there.

They x-rayed leg and found nothing  unusual for a woman my age.  Then they conducted a scan and discovered a blood clot behind my knee.  Since then, I have had intermittent pain. The Doctor referred me to a hematologist which I will see this week.  Prior to the vaccination have never had a blood clot.  It occurred three days after the vaccination.  Coincidence?  I think not.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

An 83-year-old female patient (5 feet 1 inches, about 120 pounds) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6198, patient was not sure) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Feb2021 (83-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose; the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 15Mar2021 (83-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she has got both the shots of Pfizer (Covid-19 vaccine) and at the end of the first one or it is like eighteen days, just before the second shot, something happened with her knee and it has just got worse (from 12Mar2021). She did not connect that with the Pfizer shot and I was thinking maybe it is a pulled muscle or something but it is very bad now. She would like to know what she can do. Also, she is thinking may be blood clot at this point and she would like to have it checked. She thinks that she should be able to contact somebody to actually get some physical test on this. She tried heat and cold alternate and Absorbine Jr. and Aspirin. It varied with the days, she thinks she has taken Aspirin about twice a day and it is a tablet and it was 325 mg and she took two of those, orally. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included &#34;heat and cold alternate and Absorbine Jr. and Aspirin&#34;. The outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 83-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE),  via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose (at the age of 83-years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included the patient had known allergies (unspecified) and unspecified chronic health conditions from an unknown date.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient was not pregnant. The patient received unspecified concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 15Feb2021 at 13:00 the patient experienced getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough. The events resulted in emergency room visit and the patient was hospitalized (from an unknown date) for the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough for 6 days. The clinical course is as follows: 2 or 3 weeks after the patient got the vaccine she started getting out of breath when she walked. Each day she got worse. Then the patient was taken to the hospital where they discovered the patient had three blood clots. The clots were in the patient&#39;s leg, heart and lung. The patient stated the Doctors do not understand where the clots came from. The patient was in the hospital 6 days. The patient stated they are still having breathing problem and still on oxygen as needed and they still cough at night. The patient asked if there have been any other reports of this happening to other people who got the vaccine as the patient never had blood clots before this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (nasal swab): negative on 15Mar2021.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough and included blood thinners and oxygen therapy and complete bed rest. The clinical outcome of the events getting out of breath, three blood clots/clots were in my leg heart and lung, and cough was not recovered.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                Narrative: Patient with history advanced vascular dementia, hypertensive cerebrovascular disease and stroke, T2DM. Received her second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at approximately 14:00 and was reported to have expired at home at 20:55. Dr. (Medical Director) spoke with patient&#39;s son/caregiver 2/4/21. Son reports that patient was in her usual health yesterday morning, deemed well enough by son to travel for vaccination. He reports she had no bothersome symptoms after either first or second vaccinations. Specifically denied rash, wheeze, and difficulty breathing. Son was with patient throughout the day. In the evening, when preparing for bed, he noted she became suddenly unresponsive in a similar fashion as she has done several times in past years. While in all previous such episodes she recovered within minutes, last evening she did not regain consciousness, experiences a brief period of labored breathing, and died. Patient&#39;s son called 911 and the patient&#39;s body was brought to the medical examiners. The medical examiner declined to proceed with autopsy. Patient&#39;s son is not interested in autopsy. Patient&#39;s son reports confidence that his mother&#39;s underlying hypertensive/diabetic cardiovascular disease is the natural cause of her death.

Patient was treated for severe sepsis and acute kidney injury.  Patient was given fluid resuscitation, but unresponsive to treatment; NE&#43; vasopressin, hydrocortisone IV, along with empiric antibiotic regimen were initiated. Patient later on developed pulmonary edema, Non-ST elevation MI with no chest pain and new onset of cardiomyopathy with EF 40-45% and clean coronary arteries shown on cardiac catheterization. Physician suspected cytokine release syndrome related to the COVID vaccine and congestive heart failure. Naranjo scale score of 2 indicates possible ADR.  MD indicated vaccine reaction unlikely.

Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

I spoke with her twice and my uncle and aunt checked on her three times, all three she was freezing cold and too tired to get up. In the morning, she was dazed, cold and walked to the bathroom, where she collapsed to her death. Paramedics could not revive her. My mom died Saturday morning - within the 24-hour period of her vaccine. She was feeling so great leading up to it, active, stripping the guest bedroom sheets, bubbly, and excited for us to be able to finally visit her soon.

                                                bilateral DVT; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 84-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 84-years-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EP6955) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included CKD, Allergic Rhinitis, basal cell carcinoma, vertigo, dupuytren&#39;s contracture, Gerd, hypothyroidism, hypertension, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, prediabetic, palpitations, sleep apnea, seizures, anxiety, Allergies to medications, food, or other products: BACITRACIN, LATEX, MORPHINE, POLYSPORIN, ADHESIVE TAPE. Concomitant medication(s) included azelastine (AZELASTINE); enalapril (ENALAPRIL); famotidine (FAMOTIDINE); fluoxetine (FLUOXETINE); fluticasone (FLUTICASONE); ipratropium (IPRATROPIUM); levetiracetam; levothyroxine; zonisamide; all taken for unspecified indications, start and stop dates were not reported. The Patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198) via intramuscular in right arm for COVID-19 immunization on 26Feb2021 at the age of 84-years-old.

An 85-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# ELO140, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration in arm (deltoid; unknown side) on 23Dec2020 at single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2017 and ongoing, high blood pressure from 2017 and ongoing, atrial fibrillation (A-Fib) from 2019 and ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was administered first dose of the COVID vaccine on 23Dec2020 and then was swabbed for COVID on 26Dec2020, and then on 28Dec2020 her PCR swab was positive for COVID. She was asymptomatic until she started complaining of leg pain. She ordered an ultrasound for the patient on 30Dec2020, and it confirmed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in left leg. The patient was being treated with anticoagulant apixaban (ELIQUIS) currently. Caller stated that this could be that it (DVT) is from COVID, but her real question was, could it be from the vaccine? In Pfizer&#39;s information packet for patients, there is section on what to tell your provider prior to getting vaccinated. One of the things on there is if you have a bleeding disorder or are on an anticoagulant. There is no explanation as to why it was in the packet of information. Caller has looked everywhere and can not figure out why that is on the FAQ/packet information. The patient was due for the second dose on 13Jan2020, but she was worried and hesitant to approve it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID test (PCR swab): positive on 26Dec2020, ultrasound of the left leg: confirmed DVT on 30Dec2020. The outcome of events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event &#34;COVID test (PCR swab): positive&#34; is related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The event occurred 3 days after vaccination, when vaccine was not expected to achieve the effect.  The event DVT of legs is not considered related to BNT162B2 vaccine.  The patient had underlying diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, which are considered as risk factors for DVT.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

An 85-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included dementia. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient popped hot 02Jan2021 along with 4 others on the hall she lived. Within 9 days 50&#43; patients were positive. All had the vaccine the same day. Patient was test positive on 02Jan2021. She was on day 12 of her quarantine when she started to get worse. She was unresponsive by 16Jan2021 and passed 18Jan2021. We were with her from 14Jan2021 to 18Jan2021. But had not been allowed to visit with her since Mar2020. And what post treatment pairs well with it? Publicly we hear Remdesivir and Bamlanivimab but these patients only received a general antibiotic and some vitamins. Death cause was Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan2021. No autopsy was performed.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported event of positive for corona virus infection for the lack of efficacy of the vaccine. However, based on the mechanism of action of the vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine is given. Case will be reevaluated based on follow-up information; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Xrays showed covid Poss pockets all in her lungs on 15Jan

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

                                                Atrial fibrillation; heart rate was erratic, but not as much as yesterday and today.; Her blood sugar is steady in 160s where it is normally lower in the 120s, 130s, and 140s.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 85-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9266; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, thyroid, ongoing bone strength. Concomitant medications included ongoing insulin lispro (HUMALOG) (over 150 take two units) for Diabetes, ongoing insulin (30 units of insulin) taken for diabetes, ongoing levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) (25mcg one tablet in the morning) taken for thyroid, ongoing Lisinopril (40mg one in the morning) for Blood pressure and ongoing Nifidepine (90 mg two and half hours after lisinopril) for blood pressure abnormal, ongoing Atorvastatin (one 20mg tablet at night), ongoing colecalciferol (D3) (25mcg one in the morning), cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12) (1,000mcg time release in the morning), Magnesium oxide at 400mg, ongoing calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (CALTRATE 600&#43;D3) taken for bone strength.  Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 (30mcg/0.3mL, lot: EL9265, expiration: 31May2021) on 30Jan2021 at 85 years for Covid-19 immunization. It was reported that, she has not had any problems. She goes to the doctor regularly. She has an apple watch, and she does check her heart. She also walks and tracks her steps. The last two weeks, she has noticed something knew. She has developed atrial fibrillation on an unspecified date in Feb 2021. She was concerned. She will do whatever her doctor suggests. She has read that two of the side effects are blood clots and t cells and a changing heart. She has not had atrial fibrillation in the past. She does check her heart. It was just something she does. She has had heart tests before. They checked her out last year 2020. On an unspecified date in 2020, they did a stress test and everything was fine. Everything was fine until last week. Everything was normal before that. The atrial fibrillation started last week. She decided to wait another week to see what happened. Then yesterday, the atrial fibrillation started again with all sort of swiggles. Her watch shows afib or inconsistency. It has been off the wall yesterday and today. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. The health department put up a screen on their website for people 80 and over so she signed up. She goes to the doctor this Thursday. She has diabetes, but it was under control. She takes insulin and Humalog for extra coverage. Her blood sugars have steadily been higher than normal. She took her heart rate on and off last week. It was over a couple of days. Her heart rate was erratic, but not as much as yesterday and today on an unspecified date in Feb2021. Her blood sugar was steady in 160s where it was normally lower in the 120s, 130s, and 140s on an unspecified date in Feb2021. The outcome was not recovered for atrial fibrillation, and unknown for erratic heart rate and blood sugar levels increased.    No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

An 85-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0162), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm on 10Apr2021 at the age of 85-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing arthritis and ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient reported that she was not taking anything for arthritis, just some Tylenol once in a while over the counter (it was not prescription). The patient was taking an inhaler for COPD. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER2613), administered in left upper arm on 20Mar2021 at the age of 85-years-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced bladder infection and viral infection. The patient got the first Pfizer vaccine on 20Mar2021 and was alright for a few days afterwards. Then all of a sudden, she started getting infections on 28Mar2021, 8 days after she had the first vaccine. She got a real bad bladder infection then she went to the doctor and she got medication for that. She was with bladder infection then she came down with the viral infection. The patient reported that she has not even been going anywhere because of the virus and she has been staying home. She just goes to the grocery store and clinic to the doctor, that was it. The patient had an antibiotic for the bladder infection. Sulfamethoxazole was the name of the medication that was for bladder infection. They didn&#39;t give the medication for the viral infection. The patient reported that it was just a viral infection, it was not the Covid. Since then, she had her second dose of the vaccine on 10Apr2021 and from an unspecified date in 2021, her foot started, her foot swelled up and she didn&#39;t know. She takes lot of retention pills, so she thought maybe it was that. So she took her pills and everything and washed and start getting but the next day instead of the foot going down, the swelling went up to her leg and then the next day it went all away up to her hip. The swelling on the left side from the foot all away up to the hip. She went to urgent care on 21Apr2021 (reported as &#34;21st&#34;) and saw a doctor and she was tested and she had blood clots. Regarding lab test, the patient reported she had two infections and then she got the blood clot that was from her hip all the way down to her left leg to her ankle. She could not figure out that they called the test and what they tested. But they had a lab work done then one has a test, veins, and everything. She can&#39;t remember. The patient reported that her foot and her leg was swelled, her toes all over up to her leg swelled. She had a fat foot and a fat leg just one side. She would say since she has started taking medicines for that, she took the first dose at the evening of 21st (21Apr2021), the day she went to the urgent care, and she would say it was not any worse. The medication was supposed to break up the blood clot, but it was the big one from her hip all the way down to her foot. Just a little bit better. The outcome of the events was recovering.

After the vaccine, she had no new symptoms or signs of vaccine reaction and MD friend reports that he checked her pulse which was not elevated from baseline. On 1/16,  she awakened and continued to feel at her recent baseline. However, in the early afternoon, she complained of  headache, nausea/epigastric pain, and chest heaviness. These apparently were not unusual symptoms for her to feel intermittently.  Per her niece, who has a home O2 sat device, her 02 sat that morning was 97 with a HR of 87 irregularly irregular. She was afebrile. (continue on page 2)

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ?

                                                Patient received the injection on May 2nd.  Following the injection, we noticed an increased weakness and general achiness.  On the  8th she was so weak that we purchased a gait belt to assist her.  We were not super concerned as we were expecting the second shot to cause body aches or flu like symptoms based on what we had heard from others who had received both vaccine shots.  She continued to be unsteady and we found that she has a mild UTI which we had begun treating with prescribed antibiotics. Late afternoon on the 11th, mother suffered a major stroke.  we did not take her to the hospital because we had already been told that they would not be able to do anything at her age should she suffer a stroke.  On the 12th I called the doctors office and asked for them to send Hospice to the house as we could tell that she was dying.  Mother died on the 13th.    Just a week prior to her death I had spoken with Dr. and we had discussed how that she was declining in health but that she was not even close to needing Hospice, yet she is dead a week later.  Less than 2 weeks after getting her second Covid Shot.
