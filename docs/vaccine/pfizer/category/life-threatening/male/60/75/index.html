                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Hospital course 1/31 ? 2/20/21 1/31 in ED pt was at home when children noticed his lips were blue, ems arrived and found him to be 50% on RA, on Non-rebreather pt got to 78%, covid on 01/26   Shortness of Breath   61-year-old male presents with EMS for evaluation of shortness of breath hypoxia.  History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

Patient reports mild nonproductive cough.  Reports shortness of breath, worse with activities.  He had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 10 days ago.  In the emergency room is noted to be hypoxic at 87% on room air, and now he is comfortable on 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, at about 94%.  Chest x-ray suggestive of bilateral pneumonia.  He is now testing positive for COVID-19.  3/26: The patient was diagnosed with moderate severity COVID-19 pneumonia and received Convalescent plasma and  Remdesivir on March 21st and completed 3/25. He was on dexamethasone, doxycycline and pantoprazole.  Initially D-dimer significantly elevated then trended down and the inflammatory markers trended down.  The patient initially required 2-4 L of oxygen then improved and till he did not require any oxygenation today.  His liver enzyme mildly elevated without disturbance in the liver function or kidney function. The patient will be discharged home on taper dexamethasone PO with pantoprazole for GI prophylaxis and follow-up with his PCP.

The exact date of the vaccine is unknown. His girlfriend told me he got his second Vaccine at the end of February. I also don&#39;t know what vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) he got, so the Pfizer is just a guess. Patient started feeling bad and looking bad after his second vaccine. He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

A 62-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 62-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine facility type was a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Medical history included macular. Concomitant medication included amitriptyline. The patient previously took erythromycin and statins and experienced drug allergies from these. The reported adverse events were superficial blood clot on left calf at the lower end of some varicose veins two days after injection (on 12Mar2021 at 10:00). It may be unrelated, but the patient wanted to let know. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. AE treatment included hot compress, support stockings and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Varicose veins most probably was a preexisting condition, unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine. The reported superficial blood clots are considered a complication of varicose vein and unlikely related to BNT162B2.

                                                Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 25Jan2021 13:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperlipidemia, GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), and atrial fibrillation, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had prior ablations for Afib. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 04Jan2021, 18:00, the patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included dofetilide, diltiazem, loratadine, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), and omeprazole (OMEPRA); the patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 28Jan2021 02:00, the patient experienced recurrence of atrial fibrillation after 6 months, the last episode was within a month after an ablation. No treatment was received in response tot eh event. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported recurrence of atrial fibrillation was more likely due to natural recurrence of underlying atrial fibrillation, and unlikely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

He initially developed left arm numbness and tingling which prompted admission to ER.   Later that same day, he had significant worsening with left hemiparesis.    MRI demonstrated right hemispheric ischemic stroke and focal right carotid ruptured plaque.    Somewhat unusual given his overall good health and lack of risk factors.    Has never smoked, exercises regularly and carotid duplex performed in 2017 demonstrated less than 50% right internal carotid artery stenosis.   Takes aspirin daily.     Currently remains hospitalized with significant left upper extremity paresis.  Minimal left leg function.  Did require carotid endarterectomy.  The plaque rupture was focal and hemorrhagic with no significant evidence atherosclerotic plaque beyond the focal ruptured plaque.

A 63-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route of administration at 63-years, at single dose in right arm on 17Mar2021 at 09:30 (Lot Number: ER2613) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported that, within 6 hours of getting his shot, he went into A-Fib (on 17Mar2021). He was in it for 18 hours before going back into the clinic. They took him to ER where he was electro-cardioverted. The adverse event resulted in &#34;Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care&#34;. And the patient received treatment of electro-cardioverted for the event. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. Event outcome was recovered.

The patient experienced high fever&#34; of 104, had really bad pain in his arm, was delirious and out of it and he was very ill on 08Apr2021. The reporter also stated that the patient also was unconscious at times, perspiring profusely, had bad cough, was coughing until he throws up on an unspecified date. The event pyrexia was assessed as life-threatening and pain in arm was assessed as disability by the reporter. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included fever: 104 on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pyrexia included Tylenol. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is very limited, hence the reported events are conservatively assessed as related to the administration of the vaccine.

I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

A 64-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: 20201216-1), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 08:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization, vaccine location provided as Left arm.  Medical history included arthritis and sulfa allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced myocardial infarction on 19Dec2020 23:00. The patient was hospitalized for myocardial infarction for 3 days. The patient underwent lab test which included Covid test via Nasal Swab post vaccination on 20Dec2020 with test result Negative. Therapeutic measure Cardiac cath procedure was taken as a result of myocardial infarction. The outcome of the event was recovering. This case was reported as Serious with seriousness criteria hospitalization.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported myocardial infarction and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.  However, more information is required, such as the complete medical history, clinical course, for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

He then required intubation, and had struggled with hypoxia, even on increasing PEEP. CODE BLUE called in the ED for PEA. He was medicated for such (please see the code run sheet for details), and he came in and out of the code 5 times. After 95 minutes, with the wife at the bedside, and family conference by phone, the code was called, and he was pronounced at 18:20. He received in total 8 me of Epi, 3 shots of Atropine, 3 amps bicarb. He got lasix 40 mg, lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous once. He had a CVC into the right internal jugular, and levophed was started, then Epinephrine drip was started.  Prior to the code he got steroids (solumedrol 125 mg, then later decadron 6 mg iv), benadryl iv, antibiotics (ceftraixone / zithromax), and lasix 40 mg. All this time while in the ED, the Rt was at the bedside, and lots of secretions from the lungs were aspirated, bloody color.   Code was the result of PEA secondary to hypoxia (&lt;/= 85%), despite being on the vent, with PEEP 12, FiO2 of 100%, with acidosis.   After 95 minutes of active resuscitation, the patient was found not responsive to painful stimuli. There was no palpable pulse. No spontaneous respirations. No heart or breath sounds by auscultation. Absence of pupillary light reflex.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose (at the age of 64-years old) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as injection in left shoulder) on 11Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 1982 and ongoing, ongoing seizure (he had seizures for about 6 years and they got worse,  probably it has been 6 or 7 years he has had seizures), high blood pressure, heartburn and insomnia (comes and goes). Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (manufacturer unknown, Tablet) 40mg strength,  oral administration, 20 mg daily (half a tablet at bedtime) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cholecalciferol (manufacturer unknown, Tablets) oral administration, 2 tablets in morning taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; escitalopram (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg once daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lacosamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 200 mg twice daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for approximately a couple of years) and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg daily taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mesalazine (MESALAMINE, Tablet), oral administration, 4 tablets a day  taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 20 mg as needed (two or three pills daily as he feels like he needs) taken for heartburn and ulcerative colitis from 2001 (approximately 20 years ago) and ongoing and zonisamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 100 mg twice a day taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for a couple of years) and ongoing.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received the vaccination on 11Mar2021. After he received his first dose of the vaccine he experienced a bunch of symptoms which he listed as sweating, he could not sleep at all the first night, he was falling down, he had no appetite, and had no energy that same day. This occurred after the 15 minute window of waiting after getting the vaccination. On 11Mar2021, after the vaccination, the patient went to the store to buy groceries and started sweating like crazy. He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021. He had to have another Xray to make sure he did not have bleeding on the brain.  Xray of his stomach showed kidney stones on 12Mar2021. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

He is home from the hospital now. We are lining up physical and occupational therapy.

So not sure whether having had Covid caused the clotting. Having the vaccine or being out of work with torn meniscus. They think clots started in my legs and ended up in my lungs. I was brought back after coding for 6 minutes. They seem to think Covid caused it. Not sure if vaccine contributed or not. But it did happen 4 days after the shot.

A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: eh9899), intramuscular on 21Dec2020 at 15:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at hospital. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. No other vaccine was given within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not receiving concomitant medications. Medical history included ongoing paroxysmal afib (atrial fibrillation). The patient has known allergies to squid. The patient reported having a long history of paroxysmal afib, very fit, play tennis at the national level. Prior to vaccine have had 2-3 brief bouts of afib/year. Since getting first shot and again after the second shot, have had frequent afib/apc&#39;s (atrial premature contractions) at least 6 episodes. Adverse event start date was reported as 21Dec2020 at 02:00 AM (pending clarification). No treatment was given for the event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event is considered possibly related to the suspect product based on the reportedly positive temporal association in a subject with a positive medical history of atrial arrhythmias. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

On the day pt was vaccinated, his sister picked him up for the appointment and pt refused a wheelchair. Pt walked into the clinic on his own and recevied his vaccine. Sister reported pt walked to the car after his vaccine and was winded. She dropped him off at his house and called him later to check up on him. Pt stated he was feeling fine but his arm was sore. Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied. Pt coded in parking lot of Doctor&#39;s Office and passed away at 4:31 p.m.

                                                Patient has substantial bilateral lung PE 12 days post vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (at the age of 65 years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included allergies: penicillin and testim. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. The patient had substantial bilateral lung PE (pulmonary embolism) 12 days post vaccination on 14Mar2021 (as reported, pending clarification). The event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization in Mar2021. Treatment of heparin infusion with rivaroxaban (XARELTO) initiation planned was received for the event. The patient had no covid prior vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. Outcome of event was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I called to let you know I talked to the neurologist he has sent him to his family doctor for checkup and his family doctor wanted me to let you know that this happen. Does not know if there is any relation or not but just to let you all know and this coming Thursday, he is supposed to get his 2nd vaccine. I am, just calling to let you know&#34;. The patient was taking medication for his 1st stroke and now he is taking medication for his 2nd stroke (treatment).

At 8pm, my heart was racing very fast and took blood pressure,  It was very high, 152/105 pulse 74.  I called 24hr nurse on call.  She said call 911. Ambulance was on site within 5 minute and transported me to hospital.  I was in the ER at least 6 hours, moderating my heart.  They said I had an A FIB attack.  They got it down and admitted me to the hospital.  I also experienced pain in my bladder, I could not urinate.  They had to drain it 2 times.  I was released from the hospital at 8pm the next day.  Any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me or my doctor.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

Another resident on the same hall was COVID positive on 1/11/21.  Results of the PCR test were obtained on 1/16/21.  He appeared asymptomatic at that time. Given his COVID positive status, all aerosol generating procedures had to be stopped. Overnight on 1/16/21 into 1/17/21, he had the onset of acute respiratory failure and was transported to the hospital. Per notes, he was put on BiPAP for several hours, but his CO2 level did not improve. Per prior advance directives completed with the resident and his two brothers, he had DNR/DNI orders.  The hospital physician spoke with his brother and the decision was made to  move to comfort care. He was discharged to inpatient hospice and died around 4pm on 1/18/21. This outcome does not appear to be vaccine-related, but death from COVID-19 infection is listed as a reportable event following COVID-19 vaccination.

My mother contacted Pfizer who instructed us to alternate Tylenol and Motrin. Tylenol given and Motrin given 4 hours later as instructed by Pfizer. On 3/30/21 around 11:10am my dad was found unresponsive, not breathing and did not have a pulse. My mother immediately called 911 and my aunt began CPR. When EMS arrived he was found to be in cardiac arrest and after 25 min of efforts by EMS my father passed away less than 24 hours after receiving his 2nd covid vaccine.

                                                found down unconscious; unwitnessed fall; oxygen was in the 60s; submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli; right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein; some degree of right heart dysfunction; blood sugar very high; A1C elevated; Haptoglobin elevated; elevated troponin; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 67-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 67-year-old, on 25Feb2021, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Traumatic brain injury at the age of 29 which resulted in a CVA (right sided stroke)because the hospital did not know how to give Mannitol, behavioral problems in 2008, run over by a train in 2008, wears two AFOs (one on the left leg from having a right sided stroke, he also wears one on his left leg from having a stroke with right sided weakness, the right AFO was worn since he was 29, and then the other one he started wearing in 2008 when he was run over by a train and almost had his leg severed and he wears a left AFO), dementia diagnosed 4-5 years ago, head surgeries, depression, affective disorder, anxiety. The patient had multiple hospitalizations, and he has hyper reflexivity like all brain patients have. The patient has no history of blood clots or emboli. Concomitant medications included olanzapine (ZYPREXA) taken for depression and oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) taken for affective disorder and anxiety.  The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number not reported) single dose for covid-19 immunisation, pneumonia and flu vaccine in 2008 for immunization and has no reaction. The patient received his second dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and two weeks later he was found down/ was found down unconscious at the nursing home and his oxygen was in the 60&#39;s on 15Mar2021. The nursing home did not know if her brother hit his head because it was unwitnessed. The patient was found down, not responsive, and it was an unwitnessed fall. The patient was treated as a trauma patient and that this occurred around 10 oclock on 15Mar2021. At that time, he was transferred to a local hospital to the emergency room and put on oxygen. They transferred him within 4 hours because they did not know what to do. Caller adds that the hospital thought that he had a subdural hematoma but the hospital does not have a neuro radiologist, so the hospital transferred to the other hospital that somebody with head knowledge can look at his CAT scan. The patient was misdiagnosed with a subdural hematoma because there were changes in his CT scan from his 3 previous brain surgeries. The patient had a traumatic brain injury when he was 29, and experienced changes.  The patient was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli on 15Mar2021 described as central lobar sub segmental PEs in both lungs, PE was within the distal right main artery, pulmonary artery distal left main, left middle lobe, middle right lobe / upper right lower lobe and middle lobar, segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries. The patient also had pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery of left middle lobe and left lower lobe, pulmonary arteries. There was also some degree of right heart dysfunction which was diagnosed by contrast. On 15Mar2021, the patient also had right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein. The patient is in a nursing home, the doctor did not want to listen to the reporter because her brother is a nursing home patient and they just assume he is immobile but he is not.  The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included Blood sugar very high (they think it was because of heart strain and acute injury because then it came down down down), A1C elevated, Haptoglobin elevated, elevated troponin. These results were all elevated and from acute injury. At the time of the report, the patient is feeling better and needs less oxygen. The events found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism, right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein, and some degree of right heart dysfunction caused hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The reporter absolutely does believe the events and the suspect drug are correlated. Outcome of found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism was recovered on 18Mar2021 while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                acute myocardial infarction; He was found by his secretary unconscious; feeling unwell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).

I then was assisted to the bed, where my left arm and left leg felt numb. I rested assuming this would fade away, being I has some numbness from the 1st vaccine.  On 3/24/21, as I attempted to get up from the bed,   I could not maintain my  balance and gait. The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

A 68-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 68-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included paraplegic, he has been paralyzed for 45 years. The patient received first dose of the vaccine on 10Feb2021 with lot number: EN5318, expiration 31May2021. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient went on Monday to the ER for an unrelated condition and they did a CT scan and found a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism in his right lower lobe. He confirms the pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on Monday, 15Mar2021.  He got home that night and read the headline in the (Withheld) times that said several European countries are pulling the Astra Zeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots even though there has not been any causal relationship found. He thought that with the drug companies, they should be able to have data regarding potential adverse effects for Pfizer so he was calling report that. He discusses it with the ER doctor and he couldn&#39;t really figure out why he had a blood clot, it was incidental to what he was being scanned for, it surprised him. They put him on Eliquis so he is on an anticoagulant, which will cost him a fortune. Today will be the third day he has been on the Eliquis. He is at home and he would say his only concern is that he does have hemorrhoids so when he has bowel movement tomorrow, because he doesn&#39;t go every day, but when he goes he is concerned if he starts to bleed that the anti-coagulant might cause the bleeding to be more significant than it usually is. No further information provided. His only other concern is he seems to have some kind of hypothermia, he is not entirely sure because of his thermometer is not very good. That is the reason he went into the Emergency Department because it kept reading 94.7 and he googled it and it said if it is below 95 it is a medical emergency and go to the ER so he got to the Emergency Department and it was 97.6 and now he checked his temperature again with the thermometer and it was 96.8 so either he has a faulty thermometer or something but he is experiencing some kind of chills.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

He was also within 90 days of PCR confirmed COVID-19 infection (tested positive 1/5/2021 and was still positive on 3/16/2021). This is likely unrelated as patient had multiple risk factors for stroke, but felt it worth reporting as no association cannot be found if people don&#39;t report events like this.

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

A 70-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EL0140 expiration date Mar2021) intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at 10:30 at single dose in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at Nursing Home. Patient age at time of vaccination was 70 years. Patient&#39;s Medical History included ongoing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Without Complication onset date: admission 22Oct2020, ongoing morbid obesity due to excess calories onset date: admission 22Oct2020, cardiac disorder, essential hypertension, hypertension, schizophrenia, hyperlipidemia, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), Gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), depression, hypothyroid, epilepsy, pain, dry eyes, anxiety, restlessness, 17Jan2020 Slid out of chair to floor, no injury, on 27Jan2020, 28Jan2020, 29Jan2020 diarrhea noted. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN EC) for Cardiac Health, atenolol (ATENOLOL) for Essential Hypertension, atorvastatin calcium (ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM) for hyperlipidemia, finasteride (FINASTERIDE) for benign prostatic hyperplasia, tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) benign prostatic hyperplasia, insulin glargine (LANTUS) for diabetes mellitus, lithium carbonate (LITHIUM CARBONATE) for Schizophrenia, losartan potassium (LOSARTAN POTASSIUM) for hypertension, lurasidone hydrochloride (LURASIDONE HYDROCHLORIDE) for Schizophrenia, omeprazole (OMEPRAZOLE) for gastrooesophageal reflux disease, sertraline hcl (SERTRALINE HCL) for depression, levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) for hypothyroid, ergocalciferol (VIT D) for supplement, haloperidol (HALOPERIDOL) for Schizophrenia, levetiracetam (KEPPRA) for epilepsy, paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA-STRENGTH) for pain, propylene glycol (ARTIFICIAL TEARS) for dry eyes, lorazepam (ATIVAN) for a anxiety or restlessness. As antipyretic use was reported Tylenol ES (500 mg) Tab, 2 Tabs by Mouth Routine use three times a day given at time of vaccination and after. It was reported the patient was Covid&#43;. He was tested on 21Dec2020 and was not admitted to hospital. Event Onset Date was reported as 24Dec2020 (clarification pending). On 30Dec2020 the patient was started on O2 at 2L for low pulse. O2 was increased over time to eventually O2 at 8L on 03Jan2021. Morphine Sulfate was started on 03Jan2021 at 5 mg sl/by mouth every 2 hours as needed for pain or airhunger. The patient deceased on 03Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. The AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Outcome of Low pulse was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available the events Death (unknown cause) and Heart rate decreased are attributed to patient&#39;s multiple underlying medical conditions including Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, morbid obesity, cardiac disorder, hypertension, epilepsy etc. However, based solely on a vaccine-event chronological association, contributory role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the above mentioned events cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information, including the cause of death, become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Is patient deceased: Yes

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

Allergy consulted due to anaphylactic reaction several hours after procedure. Patient was stable on RA at time of presentation and vitals were normal and stable during the procedure from 8-9 AM. Procedure log reviewed. He received fentanyl, versed, heparin, omnipaque, and xylocaine during the procedure. No immediate reactions noted and no change in vitals during procedure. He tolerated procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac recovery room on RA with normal vitals.   At 1217, patient received percocet and at 1 PM, desaturations noted on flowsheets (84% from RA). Noted pain level of 10/10. HR increased to 130s-150s and BP did drop as low as 99/87. Per notes, he developed shortness of breath, rash, and itching with this. Given albuterol, racemic epinephrine, diphenhydramine IV, famotidine IV, and solumedrol. After developing nausea, he was given IM epinephrine at 2:10 pm. Then, symptoms rapidly improved and he was transferred to CVICU. He was shortly weaned from BIPAP (briefly hypercarbic) to nasal cannula and eventually 1-2L NC.

He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number EL9267) via an unspecified route of administration at single dose in right arm on 19Feb2021 3:30PM for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included meloxicam at 15 mg one tablet per day in morning by mouth, metformin at 1000 mg twice daily by mouth, hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan (VALSARTAN &#43; HIDROCLOROTIAZIDA) at 320 mg/12.5 mg once a day in morning by mouth, all from unspecified date and ongoing for unknown indication. On 03Mar2021, the patient experienced massive heart attack with outcome of unknown. The event required a visit to the emergency room. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 03Mar2021 to ongoing. Reporter stated that &#34;Patient is in the hospital right now as he had a massive heart attack on Wednesday 03Mar2021. She reports they do not think its an adverse event related to the COVID-19 vaccine because 3 of his 4 valves were clogged, but she did fill out a form online with the state of (state withheld). The patient&#39;s second COVID-19 vaccine was rescheduled to 13Mar2021 and she is asking if the second COVID-19 vaccine can be rescheduled to the 31Mar2021, since the patient will have a long recovery. She&#39;s not sure how far they can go with the scheduling of the second vaccine before the 1st one will expire and he will have to start the series all over again&#34;.

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100.; The next day after patient got the first dose of the covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital.

                                                stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist.  A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 02Apr2021 09:00 (Lot number: EP7533) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported and there were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO); empagliflozin (JARDIANCE); lisinopril all taken for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 05Mar2021 09:00 (Lot number: EN6199) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced stroke on 11Apr2021 (Stroke 7 days after injection (as reported)), it resulted in &#34;Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event) and Disability or permanent damage&#34;. The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 2 days. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and he had not been tested for COVID since the vaccination. Event outcome was not recovered.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke is likely due to an underlying medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Although temporally related, there is no sufficient evidence that the reported stroke is related to BNT162B2. Note that the patient&#39;s medical history was not reported, however, patient is taking rivaroxaban and lisinopril for unspecified indication. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

The patient began to get weaker on 17Jan2021 (not resolved) and still with a fever (resolved in Jan2021) and they said it was the shot. They went to a walk in clinic where they did a covid test on 17Jan2021 which was negative and they gave him medicine for possible pneumonia. But he didn&#39;t get any better. They went to another clinic where he had 3 more tests on 17Jan2021, &#34;a covid test, a throat culture/ strep test and a flu test that all came back negative&#34;. On 18Jan2021 his family doctor advised him to go the hospital and he was diagnosed with double pneumonia which was resolving. The reporter stated that the event required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The reporter wanted to know if he will be able to get the second shot and asking if the first dose of the covid vaccine give him pneumonia. The medicine they gave him did not seem to be doing a lot of good, he was admitted for 3 days last week (since Jan2021 to Jan2021) and he received iv antibiotics. The medicine that was not doing good she clarified was oral pills of azithromycin (Lot: KJ9712, Expiration: Jan2022. NDC: 0781808926)that was to be taken at home.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Passed out; cardiac event; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer from a Pfizer-sponsored program COVAX Support. A 72-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Feb2021 15:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included defibrillator insertion from 2014 to an unknown date (has never had it go off), blood pressure abnormal, heart disorder, blood cholesterol increased (Lipitor indication: to lower cholesterol), and eye disorder. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EL3246), on 15Jan2021, at 15:30 PM in the left arm, for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for heart from 2010 and ongoing; carvedilol taken for heart from 2014 and ongoing; ubidecarenone (CO Q 10) helps with the statin for his heart from 2014 and ongoing; atorvastatin (LIPITOR) taken to lower cholesterol from 2014 and ongoing; lisinopril taken for blood pressure from 2014 and ongoing; xantofyl (LUTEIN) taken for eye from an unspecified start date and ongoing; and warfarin taken as blood thinner from 2010 and ongoing. The patient reported that 2 hours and 15 minutes after the second dose on 05Feb2021, he passed out and his defibrillator kicked in and he had a cardiac event but was not sure what kind of cardiac event. He stated it was probably unrelated, but the doctor said to call Pfizer to notify. He said he has had the defibrillator since 2014 and has never had it go off. He is having a stress test to check it all out. He added he felt great by about two hours after the defibrillator kicked in and went golfing. The outcome of the events was recovered on 05Feb2021.

The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

                                                I woke up the morning of February 16, 2021 with my heart beat racing (resting rate 130&#43; bpm&#39;s).  So I went ahead and did several readings with a Kardia device which showed AFIB, Tachycardia, and PVCs. I have those readings available upon request. The cause is likely from my second Covid 19 shot that was given to me Saturday, February 13, 2021. I cannot think of any other variables that would have caused this irregular hear beat. Since this event occurred, I have been in regular contact with my Cardiologist. My daily ekg&#39;s are showing frequent arrhythmias, mostly PVCs.  I&#39;m currently going through a series of tests to determine a course of action going forward (CT Cardiac Scoring, EKG&#39;s, Echocardiogram, etc.)

                                                Beginning the day after the inoculation, my husband began feeling worse in terms of his difficulty in breathing.  He used the  Albuterol inhaler more than usual.  It progressively got worse over the next 2 weeks, ending with my husband?s sudden collapse and death exactly 2 weeks later on April 5, 2021.  The inoculation may or may not have been directly linked to his unexpected death, but I feel it may have exasperated his condition, which led to his death.   And I feel it is important to report this to you.  I later heard that he should not have been using his Albuterol inhaler one week prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine.  I don?t know if that is true, but that information was never told to my husband, if it is.

                                                I have a history of previous parox. at. fibrillation but none for the last year.  A few hours after 2nd covid injection, along with  mild myalgias/prodromal sx., I went into atrial fib., with mild tach. but no other problems.  The arrythmia persisted for ~24 hr.s then converted back to sinus rhythm-- and fine since.  This event is more of an interesting observation than an &#34;adverse event&#34; but as the spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors, I thought the two events might be related and possibly of interest to you.

The vaccination station administered Epi and brought him to the ED for further evaluation.  At 12:27, patient was feeling improved and left ED. The ED physician offered steroids and he did not want anything prescribed.  He was instructed to return if symptoms worsen or do not improve.  After he left the ED, he called his PCP and stated that the ED was no help and they had tried the CDC and Health department with no luck.  Patient informed his PCP that he is experiencing elevated BP, dry sore throat, and dizziness to the point of passing out.  The conversation between the patient and provider are ongoing at this time.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

                                                blacked out; scraped his face; light headaches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 17Feb2021 03:00 (batch/lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2008 and ongoing and reported that it&#39;s under control. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient was calling because he got his shot through the (facility name withheld) on the 17Feb2021 around 3:00. The caller goes for walks, and one week later he had a blackout, about the same time he got the shot 3:00 or 3:15 on 24Feb2021. The caller blacked out and he broke his glasses, scraped his face, all that stuff. All the scrapes were healing. The weirdest thing was it happened almost exactly a week later. The caller asked was it possible that this could be related to the vaccine. For the following two days after the vaccine the caller had 2 light headaches on 18Feb2021 and then they were gone on 19Feb2021. This blackout event happened one time. Caller mentioned the headaches were nothing to be concerned about. The caller was not given a vaccination card at the (facility name withheld) and does not know the lot number, NDC number, or expiration date. This was the caller&#39;s first dose of the vaccine. The caller mentioned that 11Mar2021 was his next appointment for the second dose of the vaccine. The caller has never had a black out episode or dizziness before. The caller said he licked his wounds and will be okay. No visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office required. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No relevant tests done. The outcome was recovered on 19Feb2021 for the event Headache; and recovering for the other events.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

They ordered antibiotics. Symptoms persisted, so he went to a ?minute clinic? and got a chest xray. When his PCP got those results, he was instructed to go to the ED immediately, where he was admitted for pneumonia. PCP told patient that pneumonia was caused by covid vaccine and has instructed patient to not get second dose.

A 73-year-old male patient (husband) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9810), intramuscularly administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 at age of 73 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial flutter, cardiac ablation from Jan2020, tooth infection, root canal, ongoing prostate issues. Concomitant medication included tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) taken for prostate issues from an unspecified start date and ongoing, medication for nasal congestion (He had a lot of sinus issues. It was mainly nasal sprays that he used). The patient previously took penicillin BK for tooth infection, clindamycin for tooth infection, amoxicillin for tooth infection, paracetamol (TYLENOL) for pain. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation on 16Feb2021. This case was a serious report with Seriousness criteria-Caused/prolonged hospitalization. Reporter said that her husband got the first dose of the vaccine on 06Feb2021 and on 15Feb2021 he went to the cardiologist. She said that he had a history of atrial flutter and had an ablation over a year ago in Jan2020. She said that he went in for a routine check. She said that he had been off of his cardiac medications because he was doing fine after the ablation. The doctor told him to follow up in a year. On 16Feb2021, he started having weird things going on with his heart. He took some medication to help the rate of his heart. Reporter clarified that he took Metoprolol (TOPROL XL) 50mg that he had in the house. The doctor told him to take it in case something happened. She said that there was the chance that he had Afib and was just asymptomatic. They never saw any evidence of Afib previously though, just AFlutter. He had no episodes of Afib. She said that previously he went off of his medications and was doing ok. They were told to buy a watch that monitors his heart rate. Reporter said that when she checked his heart rate on the pulse ox it was 180. She called an ambulance and he was admitted to the hospital for atrial fibrillation. She said that they had to do a cardioversion in the ambulance on the way there and it was a significant occurrence. Her husband experienced Afib about 10 days later after the vaccine, was cardioverted on the way to the hospital and was hospitalized due to atrial flutter. Reporter stated doctor told them they didn&#39;t see any correlation with the vaccine. Reporter wanted to know if these symptoms were reported before. She said that during this period of time, he had been on 3 different antibiotics for a tooth infection and had a root canal. She said that he took these from the beginning of Jan2021 for about a week each. She said that his tooth infection was not any better or was worse and they would try another antibiotic. Reporter clarified that the antibiotics were Penicillin BK first, then he was on Clindamycin the second time, then was on Amoxicillin the 3rd time. He was also on Tylenol 3 for the pain during this as well.  The patient took 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EM6198) intramuscularly in the Left arm on 01Mar2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Blood clots after the 2nd dose; Blood clot split and some went into side of lung; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 14Feb2021 at 15:45 (Lot Number: EL3247) (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, family history, or concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: E10142 (as reported)), in the right arm, on 24Jan2021 at 15:45 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung in Feb2021, which required hospitalization from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated he did not know what date the blood clots occurred and can&#39;t tell when that happened, but it was maybe a few weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. He stated that one blood clot is in the right leg near the calves and the blood clot broke and split some and went up into the side of his lung as it was detected in a doppler on 27Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The doppler was performed as soon as he went into the emergency room and they went through a series of tests with unknown results on 27Feb2021 and 28Feb2021. The patient stated that the right leg is bigger than the other leg and they told him it might stay that size and may not go down. The patient is now on apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg for the rest of his life. In the beginning, they gave him an unspecified shot in his stomach, then after that he began taking apixaban at two pills in the morning and two pills at night, then they cut him down to 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening, and he started it right when he went into the hospital immediately. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung was unknown.

A 73-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included psoriasis , cardiac pacemaker insertion on an unknown date (He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago) , hypertension from an unknown date.      The patient  died three days after taking the vaccine  on 09Apr2021 , he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 150/90   on  09Apr2021.    It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Course of the event: The reporter&#39;s uncle died three days after taking the vaccine. He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature. He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago and has a history of psoriasis and HTN. There is additional concomitant medical history I will have to confirm.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment for the reported patient&#39;s sudden death.

Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

A 74-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: EL1283) at 0.3 mL single on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid; hypertension, was under control with the medication; dementia, taking memantine as a treatment for dementia, no other impairment other than what he normally has from his dementia. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; memantine for dementia; fish oil tablet; Vitamins. Patient had a mild heart attack and a slight stroke and he did have urinary tract and blood infection on 24Jan2021. They both had the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 20Jan2021, Saturday night into Sunday. He was a dementia patient, alert to his name. On 24Jan2021, he fell out of bed and couldn&#39;t get up, he was flushed, so patient&#39;s wife took his temperature, he had a fever of 101. Patient&#39;s wife couldn&#39;t move him, so called the paramedics and they took him to Hospital. Patient&#39;s wife just found out that he had a very mild heart attack and slight stroke, no impairment other than what he normally had from the dementia. Patient&#39;s wife was wondering should he get the second shot and what was the timing of the 2nd dose of vaccine. Reporter seriousness for mild heart attack, slight stroke, urinary tract and blood infection was hospitalization. They also have him on some sort of penicillin derivative for a urinary tract infection. Since he had been to the hospital, he had at his doctor&#39;s office about 2 weeks ago today, he had a blood test, a urine test. His A1C was 6.5, there was a little blood in his urine. For that since Sunday (24Jan2021) he was having MRI, he had a couple of PET scans, he had an electrocardiogram. The neurologist came in to check on him. He was in hospital now. Hospitalization date was 25Jan2021 early in the morning. The outcome of events was unknown.

Had to go to bed sitting up with three pillows on my back. The next morning went to doctor who ordered blood test and chest X-Ray. Chest X-Ray indicated Pulmonary Embolism. Doctor started me on Eliquis blood thinner to hopefully desolve the blood clot on my lung. Doctor suggested I report Pulmonary Embolism occuring same day as my first vaccine shot. Do not know if shot caused Pulmonary Embolism or just a coinsidence. In addition doctor found blood in my urine and a CT of Bladder has been ordered

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern.

Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

                                                My father complained of heartburn the evening he received his vaccine.  He told my mother he need to sit  down and relax.  My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

Patient&#39;s family was notified of decline and agreed for the patient to be transition to comfort care early 2/28. Bedside RN notified pronouncing physician of cessation of respiration and cardiac activity.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.
