                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 1 week following first Pfizer vaccination, I began having achiness in left leg and thought this was possibly from sitting in a chair without enough cushion.  I simply could not get leg comfortable.  Over a couple days duration the leg continued to be achy and slightly swollen.  On December 23rd at night I awoke due to such discomfort in leg and could not get comfortable enough to go to sleep.   I went to ED where I was examined and found to be mildly short of breath and in pain.  Ultrasound of leg showed large upper leg DVT.  CT of chest showed submassive Pulmonary Horseshoe Embolus.   I was placed on Heparin and anticoagulated.  Hospitalized for several days while anticoagulated and observed for any clot progression or respiratory distress and discharged home on Xarelto for anticoagulation and follow up with PCP, Hematology, Pulmonary medicine.

                                                Per triage notes on 4/21/21: Pt had his 2nd COVID vaccine today at 0800. At 0900 developed lip swelling. Took two doses of Benadryl and has now developed chest tightness and throat swelling. Per doctor&#39;s notes: Patient is a very pleasant 60-year-old gentleman who comes in for evaluation after a possible allergic reaction today, possibly related to a second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine that he got at 8 AM this morning.  About an hour later he started to feel flushed.  He felt like his face was warm and his ears were warm.  He started to feel like the inside of his mouth had filled with a rubber ball.  His tongue felt full and he started noticed progressively that he felt like he was having difficulty swallowing.  States that he never actually had any lip swelling, contrary to the triage note, just felt funny in the interior of his mouth.  Did feel like his tongue was slightly swollen, both based on the fact that it felt &#34;thick&#34; when he was talking, and on direct inspection, as well.  Took 50 mg of Benadryl around the time that his symptoms started, and lay down to nap for a little while.  When he woke up he was still feeling like he was having more difficulty swallowing.  He also felt like his face was a little bit puffy, prickly under each eye.  He also felt like he had a blotchy rash on his chest and upper back, which his wife corroborates.  He felt like his chest was a little bit tight and that something was heavy on his chest, though he was not wheezing or acutely short of breath, per se.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl at about 2:15 PM, and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation.  Currently still has a little bit of chest tightness and throat tightness.  He feels flushed.  Symptoms have not worsened, but they have not completely resolved, either.  He has had anaphylaxis in the past and has had to be admitted to the hospital.  And this was in relation to taking doxycycline, it sounds like. Patient presented again to the ED on 4/22/21 with the same symptoms. He was admitted with anaphylaxis. Per ED notes, also diagnosed with Angioedema, improved. Likely related to second covid vaccine. Cant rule out secondary to Lisinopril.

On 04Jun2021 after vaccination, the patient experienced fatigue and it was increased. By mid of the May the patient tolerates walking but got shortness of breath (SOB) on stairs. On 20May2021, the physician doubled Furosemide (LASIX) dose for unspecified trip. During the trip, the patient had difficulty walking uphill. It was reported that patient passed out at end of trip, it was confirmed with ventricular tachycardia. On an unknown date, the patient underwent echocardiogram, and the ejection fraction was 25%. On 04Jun2021, the patient admitted to hospital in 100% atrial fibrillation &amp; significant ventricular arrhythmias. The patient was treated with Intravenous heparin and he was kept for 2 nights in the hospital. It continued to worsen. On 08Jun21, the patient was unable to walk more than 10 feet, while talking caused shortness of breath and nauseous/vomiting. The patient was admitted to another hospital.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

The exact date of the vaccine is unknown. His girlfriend told me he got his second Vaccine at the end of February. I also don&#39;t know what vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) he got, so the Pfizer is just a guess. Patient started feeling bad and looking bad after his second vaccine. He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 61-years of age), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 17Mar2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago (2005), and had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine (Dec2020). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took ANCEF [cefazolin sodium] and had allergies; and oxacillin which the patient had allergies and hepatitis. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination nor was he tested for covid since vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  It was reported that the day the patient received the first vaccine his calf, foot, and knee swelled up by evening. It stayed swollen for a week and he went to see his doctor. He did an ultrasound on his calf and found a deep blood clot. He was now on blood thinners. He mentioned that he had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine but it was progressing fine. Usually blood clots occur after surgery within a 2 week period. He had a blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago. He was reporting this because his doctor was not sure why he got the blood clot and it coincided with the vaccine.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound scan: found a deep blood clot  in Mar2021. The events started on 17Mar2021 18:30 with outcome of recovering. The events resulted to doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result the events with LOVANOX and PRADAXA.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

I believed it to be vaccine side effects and continued normal daily exercise routine, which is quite rigorous in some instances.  Exercise seemed to alleviate problem temporarily.  I never considered angina or heart issues as a  problem since I&#39;ve had great exam stats, including low cholesterol, low triglycerids, normal EKG, not overweight, never smoke, exercise regularly, maintain healthy diet.  Day of second dose, chest pain and headaches increased significantly.  EKG performed by PCP and Emergency Room confirmed abnormal.  Diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, emergency angiosplasty performed on right coronary artery.  I felt this all to coincidental given timing and duration of side effect with 1st and 2nd shot.  All EKGs in past, including one in August 2020, normal, and then abnormal six months later.

                                                2 hours after receiving his first vaccine the patient was presenting with light headedness, sweaty, pale, and stomach pain. I took his BP and it was 80/60 with a pulse of 60. I called 911 because he had a history of CHF and I didn&#39;t want his pulse to drop and not have other trained personnel on hand if CPR was required. I gave him water to try to raise his BP and rechecked his BP after 5 minutes and it raised to 127/83 with a pulse of 64. He stopped sweating and his color came back in his face at that time. The EMT&#39;s rechecked vitals and ended up taking him to the ED to run tests.

His doctor sent him to the ER (emergency room). The patient mentioned that the ER did a CAT scan on 12May2021 and found that he had a blood clot in his right leg (reported as 10May2021). The patient&#39;s wife comes on the line and stated the reason her husband called to report was because it could be from the vaccine, but they are not sure. The wife added that her husband went to the pharmacy to pick up the blood thinner and they told him to report this. She also stated that all the side effects could happen, but he did know the side effects and he just wanted to report because the pharmacy told him to report. She mentioned that her husband started complaining his leg hurt because he has to do yard work.

I&#39;ve never had blood clots until I subjected my perfectly healthy body to the Covid vaccination.  On the morning of April 30, 2021, I was suddenly overcome with a sense of disorientation and dizziness.  Spouse drove me to the ER. They discovered I had experienced a stroke. Let me be absolutely clear.  The Pfizer vaccine is the sole reason I developed blood clots and had a stroke.  I was perfectly healthy until I got vaccinated.  I now have brain fog, dizziness, and every day is a challenge. I feel so dumb for falling for the get vaccinated garbage.

A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

When she asked if it was chest pain, he said he didn&#39;t know.  He went downstairs, vomited, slumped over against the wall behind the couch, and became unresponsive.  Wife called 911 and was instructed to begin CPR.  EMS crew arrived shortly after that and performed prolonged resuscitation efforts as per ACLS protocol.  Pt pronounced at 3:15 am.  Patient had not seen a physician in many years, had not had any vaccines in over 20 years, took no medications, and had no known medical history.  He did have a strong family history of heart disease and had told his wife the week prior to his death that he had suffered a several-hour bout of chest pain that resolved spontaneously 2-3 days prior to his telling her about it.  He refused to seek medical evaluation despite her urging.

A 62-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 62-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine facility type was a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Medical history included macular. Concomitant medication included amitriptyline. The patient previously took erythromycin and statins and experienced drug allergies from these. The reported adverse events were superficial blood clot on left calf at the lower end of some varicose veins two days after injection (on 12Mar2021 at 10:00). It may be unrelated, but the patient wanted to let know. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. AE treatment included hot compress, support stockings and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Varicose veins most probably was a preexisting condition, unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine. The reported superficial blood clots are considered a complication of varicose vein and unlikely related to BNT162B2.

He was hospitalized on 3/28 due to low blood oxygen levels.  Was diagnosed with COVID and pneumonia.  Treated with remdesivir and a steroid, then monoclonal antibodies.

                                                Stroke; Left ventricular thrombus in his heart; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 62-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0153) as UNKNOWN, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included coronary artery disease (several years ago) and had a bypass (several years ago; not ongoing). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient had a stroke on 17Apr2021 after he formed a left ventricular thrombus in his heart in Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for the events from 17Apr2021 to 23Apr2021 and was treated with Coumadin. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Drug causality would seem unlikely for BNT162B2 vaccine  since there is no plausible mechanism implicating the subject drug to the events. The reported events may be regarded as natural progression of patient&#39;s pre-existing conditions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 62-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 21Jan2021 07:30  (62-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included psoriatic arthritis from 10 years (he started Cosentyx three or four weeks before reporting) and COVID virus from Nov2020. Concomitant medications included secukinumab (COSENTYX) from three or four weeks before reporting for psoriatic arthritis. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 31Dec2020 07:30 (62-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was none. Patient states he just wanted to report; and he didn&#39;t know if this is significant. Patient reports now he has bilateral pulmonary embolism (from 04May2021) along with an upper respiratory tract something going on. Adds he never had this before. The doctor for his possible bronchitis has him on Omnicef and started Xarelto. Adds they were lucky to find the pulmonary embolism. Mentions the doctor tried a different antibiotic first, Keflex (NDC 68180 0122 02), and it was not helping. The doctor noticed his pulse oximeter (on 04May2021) reading was 92% and did a chest x ray. The chest x ray (on 04May2021) showed left lower lobe atelectasis. The doctor said that would not account for the low pulse oximeter of 92%. She sent him for a D Dimer (on 04May2021) that was positive, reading 1.95; and then had a chest CT at 1:00PM on Tuesday (04May2021), that showed the bilateral pulmonary embolism. Adverse events required a visit to physician office (received outpatient tests). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event possible bronchitis and included Omnicef and Xarelto. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                3/22, admitted for NSTEMI 2 days after Covid vaccine. Patient was shoveling snow on the morning of March 22, 2021.  Shortly after doing that, he developed chest pain.  He did not immediately seek medical attention, however.  Rather, he had a preexisting appointment with his primary care provider, which he went to later that morning.  The PCP did an EKG and found him to be having an acute inferior ST elevation MI. The patient was subsequently transferred by EMS to the emergency room at the hospital and then was taken immediately for emergency cardiac catheterization.  The catheterization revealed 100% acute occlusions of both the proximal LAD and the distal RCA.  These were both opened and stented.  There was 1 drug-eluting stent placed in the proximal LAD, and 2 overlapping drug-eluting stents were placed extending from the distal RCA into the proximal PDA.  Postprocedure, the patient did well with resolution of his chest pain.  His peak troponin was 38.6.  An echocardiogram was done on March 22, 2021, and showed inferior akinesis and septal hypokinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 45% to 50%.  The patient was started on the usual medications post MI and PCI.  On the morning of discharge, March 24, 2021, he is feeling well and is medically stable for discharge.

                                                The day after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine, my father started to experience lethargy, headaches, nausea and vomiting. These are all advertised as common symptoms of the second dose so he did not seek medical treatment until 5/11/21, five days after. He went to the emergency room, his systolic blood pressure was over 200. A CT scan showed bleeding going from his basal ganglia to the right ventricle of his brain. His blood pressure had gotten so high that he had a hemorrhagic stroke. He has since been in the ICU. He had to undergo a ventriculostomy, was put onto a ventilator, and has now had a tracheostomy.  He still has not regained full motor function and will have a long road to recovery after the stroke.

                                                I experienced a distorted vision problem covering the upper left corner of my visual field.  I assumed it was fatigue.  When it didn?t get better by 4/1/21, I went to Patient First be checked out.  They sent me to Advanced Eye Care to follow-up with an ophthalmologist.  She confirmed that the vision loss was being caused by something in my brain, at which time she sent me to the ER.  At the hospital, an MRI revealed that I had suffered a stroke in the lower right rear side of my brain that was affecting my site in the upper left part of my visual field.

                                                After my vaccine on 03/17/21 I started experiencing a rapid heart beat and at time my heart would skip!  I reported this to the Covid 19 hotline immediately and also notified my doctor!  My doctor scheduled a visit and did an EKG and also ordered a heart monitor which I wore for two weeks.  The report from that went to Dr, a cardiologist at clinic where I was diagnosed as having Afib.  I was shocked since my heart has always been healthy and heart disease does not run in my family!  I was put on a beta blocker because of the concern of having a stroke!  A follow-up visit to discuss a procedure that will fix my Afib in scheduled for 06/22/21.

Shortness of breath, tiredness and interference with my daily interactions. I would get tired about 30 minutes of anything. Whatever the medical term is for when you get tired easily, shortness of breath etc. Just basic AFIB symptoms. The Dr gave me Solital 2x per day and as soon as he did that, within two days the AFIB went away. He took away my blood pressure medication and gave me the Solital. But I still get tired easier than I did before.

                                                Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 25Jan2021 13:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperlipidemia, GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), and atrial fibrillation, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had prior ablations for Afib. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 04Jan2021, 18:00, the patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included dofetilide, diltiazem, loratadine, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), and omeprazole (OMEPRA); the patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 28Jan2021 02:00, the patient experienced recurrence of atrial fibrillation after 6 months, the last episode was within a month after an ablation. No treatment was received in response tot eh event. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported recurrence of atrial fibrillation was more likely due to natural recurrence of underlying atrial fibrillation, and unlikely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Symptoms started at 1:36 pm while walking to catch train. Pt noted numbness and felt light headed. Pt had mild headache that he associated with not eating much. Pt returned back to urgent care because of symptoms and RR team called.    Pt had given blood for tests (12 vials) and abdominal ultrasound earlier in the morning as work up for his chronic renal insufficiency. Pt drank several cups of water before the ultrasound.  Symptoms initially improved but did not resolve, so he was sent to ER for stroke. Pt had 3 more episodes of worsening left sided numbness and lost consciousness on 2 of those occasions per the patient. Neurology evaluated patient and said that they were likely thalamic strokes. Pt was unable to have an MRI because of metal in his eye.

He initially developed left arm numbness and tingling which prompted admission to ER.   Later that same day, he had significant worsening with left hemiparesis.    MRI demonstrated right hemispheric ischemic stroke and focal right carotid ruptured plaque.    Somewhat unusual given his overall good health and lack of risk factors.    Has never smoked, exercises regularly and carotid duplex performed in 2017 demonstrated less than 50% right internal carotid artery stenosis.   Takes aspirin daily.     Currently remains hospitalized with significant left upper extremity paresis.  Minimal left leg function.  Did require carotid endarterectomy.  The plaque rupture was focal and hemorrhagic with no significant evidence atherosclerotic plaque beyond the focal ruptured plaque.

He received first dose of Pfizer vaccine for COVID about 1 week ago. Patient&#39;s PTT was high on presentation even before being started on heparin.  Due to sudden drop in hemoglobin patient&#39;s heparin drip was suspended since 4/12.  Mixing studies showed partial correction consistent with acquired factor inhibitor.  Factor VIII levels less than 1 consistent with factor VIII inhibitor. Patient was started on FEIBA at 100 units/kg every 12 hours, tolerated very well,  In order to eliminate the inhibitor immunosuppressive therapy was initiated: Will continue Solu-Medrol 80 mg daily and Cytoxan 2 mg/kg daily.  This treatment will continue until his clinical stability is achieved, at which point taper will be initiated.  Patient required 2 transfusion over the course of the hospitalization. Currently, he is stable but still hospitalized and receiving treatments. No signs of new bleeds.

The patient got his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot on Monday 15Mar2021 at sometime between 15:30-16:00. Not even an hour after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot his arm started hurting real bad, felt like a hot ice pick was in his arm-described as it started locally just in one spot, then started getting worse going down to his elbow. About 30-45 minutes after got out of there, he was sick, didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him. Also reported as by 16:30 he felt bad and pulled up to a friends house. He would say it was an allergic reaction; starting in his arm, a severe pain that radiated down to elbow, arm, chest, it was hard to breathe since 18Mar2021. He went to a friends house after getting the shot, and by the time he got to the friend&#39;s house, he felt sick and laid down for about two hours and just kept feeling worse and worse. After that he went home and went to bed. He stayed in bed Tuesday, 16Mar2021, Wednesday, 17Mar2021 and was able to drag himself out of bed to at least go to the bathroom on Thursday morning, 18Mar2021. When he got out of bed, he couldn&#39;t breathe. When he got up Thursday morning he couldn&#39;t even move his whole left side, had to grab nightstand and pull himself up to stand up out of the bed; stumbled to the bathroom about 3 feet away.He made his way to the phone and called his sister to tell her to call an ambulance because he couldn&#39;t breathe. When he got to the emergency room he was told he was in atrial fibrillation. He stayed in the hospital with primary diagnosis as multifocal pneumonia with atrial fibrillation.

He stayed in Hospital for 4 days-admitted 18Mar2021-discharged 22Mar2021. He spoke to his heart doctor who said it was hard to breathe due to the Atrial fibrillation and all his doctors say they did not know whether it was a reaction to the covid vaccine.He heard the doctors talking and they were saying they didn&#39;t think he was going to make it. His heart rate was going between 80 and 200. He had 3 different IV&#39;s going in each arm shooting different heart medications in him and the doctor explained that the medications didn&#39;t mix well, could not go in the same IV at the same time. The patient shared that this was the second worst feeling he has ever had since he had his first heart surgery. He meant they thought he was dead or dying he lost feeling of everything. His arm felt better, but every now and again felt like a little knot or something was in there. He was breathing better, they gave him inhalers, albuterol. He thought that his heart doctor was going to start him on oxygen. He went to his Cardiologist on 01Mar2021 on Monday, 2 weeks before getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: cardiologist told him his triglycerides raised up about 15 was about 268. All his Cardiologist did was change his blood pressure medicine. Went to his Endocrinologist on 08Mar2021 Monday, 1 week before he took the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: Endocrinologist raised his Lantus SoloStar U-100 insulin 100 units/mL (3mL) from 60 units nightly to 64 units nightly then. All his other blood tests were good, they just said keep doing what you&#39;re doing.The outcome of all the events was resolving.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included aspirin, clopidogrel (PLAVIX), atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR), evolocumab (RAPATHA). The events caused hospitalization. The patient recovered from the events on an unknown date.  Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a contributory role of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) to the reported events of diarrhea, vomiting, could not speak and stroke cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once more information become available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

Medical history included enlarged prostate, urinary health issues (gets up in the middle of the night), and has glasses as he had cataract surgery last year (2020) so he lost his close-up vision. Concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Feb2021, the patient got his first shot. Three weeks later, he had an episode of urinating blood and blood clots profusely. The patient stated the amount of blood and blood clots was scary at best. The patient reached out to his daughter who is a nurse who advised him to go to the Emergency Room (ER). He reached out to the nurse hotline as well, which recommended that he go to the emergency room that day as well. He went to the ER (it was a Sunday). They did a blood test, a sonogram or some kind of sonogram, and a urine sample. They also flushed the patient&#39;s bladder out with a catheter. This emergency room visit determined that it might be a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started him on antibiotics. The patient confirmed he was not admitted to the hospital. The patient then made an appointment with his doctor because that was on a weekend. He saw his doctor who referred him to a urologist. The patient also reported that he did have the normal arm pain and fatigue the second day or the day after the shot. The patient reported 11Mar2021 or 12Mar2021 was when he started bleeding after the first shot, he was unsure of the exact date, and stated he went to the hospital on 14Mar2021. The patient reported he is going to the doctor today (21Apr2021), to see the urologist but the urologist is going to do a scope in his bladder because that is the only thing that they cannot see. The clinical outcome of events urinating blood, blood clots, UTI, bleeding, arm pain, and fatigue was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) :PFIZER INC-2021471072 same patient/reporter, different AE/2nd dose

A 63-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE),dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 03Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) as SINGLE DOSE (at the age of 63 years) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (diagnosed for a decade), ongoing hypertension (diagnosed for a decade), ongoing type 2 diabetes mellitus (5-6 years ago diagnosed, very well maintained type 2 diabetes), ongoing pneumonia (He has been hospitalized 4 different times for pneumonia. In Dec2020 when he had pneumonia, they did not hospitalize him. He has had pneumonia 5 time since 1982. Concomitant medication included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. &#34;He gets the flu shot every, and he has had the shingles shot. He also gets the pneumonia vaccine every 2 years.&#34; The patient experienced pneumonia (hospitalization) on an unspecified date with outcome of not recovered, itchy, on 08Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, dry cough on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered and non-productive cough on 08Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: unknown results on Oct2020.  On 13Apr2021 He reported it to the doctor and he told the patient to skip a dose of Lisinopril that sometimes it can have those symptoms of a deep nonproductive cough. He skipped the medication, and it hasn&#39;t gotten better. He thinks it is from the COVID vaccine.  At the peak of his cough, he probably had 6 days where he coughed uncontrollably for 24 hours in a day.  He still has a cough.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pneumonia. The doctor didn&#39;t do a chest X-ray or COVID test.

                                                While this first vaccine gave no side effects other than a slightly sore arm, 17 days later on 4-17-2021 I suffered a TIA (Transcient Ischemic Attack). That occurred at 5:15 pm and I immediately took 4-81 mg aspirin and headed for a nearby Emergency Room. They said it was a stroke (and it did show on an MRI the next day but sub-centimeter and I was told the size of a pinhead. AT the ER the double vision in my left eye and numbness in left lips, gum and tongue were already subsiding, but the DR there gave me a Plavix and within 5 minutes I was completely back to normal (or close). I am not sure IF that first dose of vaccine had anytrhing to do with this TIA, but it might have? I had also stopped taking my 81mg aspirin several days before this TIA as I had a Periodontal appointment for insertion of an implant post and wanted to control the possible bleeding. The thoughts of my Doctor at Hospital  as well as the Neurologists was that the omission of the aspirin PROBABLY was the main cause of the temporary clotting that caused this event HOWEVER I did not tell them that I was 17 days post-Covid Pfizer vax #1 and so the possibility remains that the vaccine could have  been partially the cause of this event? As listed previously, Dr at Hospital was my Doctor and might shed some light on this and her thoughts. I felt it was important enough to report as I have heard stories of all of the vaccines possibly causing some clotting and this might fit.

He developed sternal CP radiating to both shoulders while working in the garden on 4/11. The pain improved with acetaminophen and sleeping overnight, but still was present in the morning, prompting him to go to the ED. EKG showed diffuse 1-mm ST segment elevations, prompting emergent cardiac catheterization &#43; coronary angiography --- &gt; no obstructive CAD. cTnI and CK-MB were normal. He had WBC 14.1 &amp; CRP 9.3, which raised suspicion for acute pericarditis, although his symptoms were not typical. Overnight 4/12-4/13, he developed new-onset rapid atrial fibrillation which was treated with IV diltiazem and metoprolol tartrate. He is discharged with colchicine and metoprolol tartrate. The CP resolved postprocedurally and did not recur.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

He then required intubation, and had struggled with hypoxia, even on increasing PEEP. CODE BLUE called in the ED for PEA. He was medicated for such (please see the code run sheet for details), and he came in and out of the code 5 times. After 95 minutes, with the wife at the bedside, and family conference by phone, the code was called, and he was pronounced at 18:20. He received in total 8 me of Epi, 3 shots of Atropine, 3 amps bicarb. He got lasix 40 mg, lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous once. He had a CVC into the right internal jugular, and levophed was started, then Epinephrine drip was started.  Prior to the code he got steroids (solumedrol 125 mg, then later decadron 6 mg iv), benadryl iv, antibiotics (ceftraixone / zithromax), and lasix 40 mg. All this time while in the ED, the Rt was at the bedside, and lots of secretions from the lungs were aspirated, bloody color.   Code was the result of PEA secondary to hypoxia (&lt;/= 85%), despite being on the vent, with PEEP 12, FiO2 of 100%, with acidosis.   After 95 minutes of active resuscitation, the patient was found not responsive to painful stimuli. There was no palpable pulse. No spontaneous respirations. No heart or breath sounds by auscultation. Absence of pupillary light reflex.

One day after receiving the vaccination I took a walk with some hills and had what I believe was a mild episode of atrial fibrillation. I verified as best I could, using a pulse oximeter.  I feel fine for the most part, but a little bit tired and dizzy. I do not plan to call the doctor unless things get worse.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose (at the age of 64-years old) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as injection in left shoulder) on 11Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 1982 and ongoing, ongoing seizure (he had seizures for about 6 years and they got worse,  probably it has been 6 or 7 years he has had seizures), high blood pressure, heartburn and insomnia (comes and goes). Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (manufacturer unknown, Tablet) 40mg strength,  oral administration, 20 mg daily (half a tablet at bedtime) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cholecalciferol (manufacturer unknown, Tablets) oral administration, 2 tablets in morning taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; escitalopram (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg once daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lacosamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 200 mg twice daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for approximately a couple of years) and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg daily taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mesalazine (MESALAMINE, Tablet), oral administration, 4 tablets a day  taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 20 mg as needed (two or three pills daily as he feels like he needs) taken for heartburn and ulcerative colitis from 2001 (approximately 20 years ago) and ongoing and zonisamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 100 mg twice a day taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for a couple of years) and ongoing.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received the vaccination on 11Mar2021. After he received his first dose of the vaccine he experienced a bunch of symptoms which he listed as sweating, he could not sleep at all the first night, he was falling down, he had no appetite, and had no energy that same day. This occurred after the 15 minute window of waiting after getting the vaccination. On 11Mar2021, after the vaccination, the patient went to the store to buy groceries and started sweating like crazy. He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021. He had to have another Xray to make sure he did not have bleeding on the brain.  Xray of his stomach showed kidney stones on 12Mar2021. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

So not sure whether having had Covid caused the clotting. Having the vaccine or being out of work with torn meniscus. They think clots started in my legs and ended up in my lungs. I was brought back after coding for 6 minutes. They seem to think Covid caused it. Not sure if vaccine contributed or not. But it did happen 4 days after the shot.

                                                MI, symptoms started 2 hours after immunization; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 64-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), intramuscularly, administered in the right arm on 14Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported. Relevant medical history included obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP; hypogonadism on bioTE; depression; history of (h/o) pneumonia; colon polyps; recurrent sinusitis; erectile dysfunction; MTHFR Mutation C677T Heterozygous; low high density lipoprotein (HDL); dyslipidemia; lumbar disc disease; and sciatica; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL); anastrozole; celecoxib (CELEBREX); levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP THYROID); and escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM), from which the patient had known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient experienced myocardial infarction (MI), symptoms started 2 hours after immunization on 14Apr2021. The adverse event (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for the event &#34;MI, symptoms started 2 hours after immunization&#34; for 3 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event, which included cardiac stent. The patient was recovering from the event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the event of myocardial infarction.  The reported event likely represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient with history of dyslipidemia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                My husband who is 64 years old, was a previously in good health. Only history was mild cardiomyopathy diagnosed 12 years ago. And elevated blood pressure, which was normal with medications. He was very active, maintained a demanding full time job and was a great husband of 2 children. He received his 2nd dose of Pfizer on approximately 4/1/21. He didn?t complain of any side effect. However, on the morning of 4/27/21 he woke me up saying that he could not breath. We started driving to the hospital, however he got worse and we stopped at the fire station. They gave his oxygen and rushed him to the hospital. We came to hospital and when the fire truck was pulling in, I was told that my husband went into pulseless electrical activity. CPR was started and after approximately 5 minutes he regained pulse. He was taken to the ICU and therapeutic hypothetic protocol was completed. Since then, he is still requiring mechanical ventilation. He opens his eyes spontaneously, at times appears to obey small commands and is bedridden.

                                                36 hours following injection of my second Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/21/21, I suffered an afib episode lasting 15 hours starting in the early morning hours of 3/23/21.  I then experienced another episode of afib lasting 19.5 hours on 4/10/21.  On 4/16/21, I suffered my third afib episode following my second injection, which lasted three hours.  As I was converting to a normal sinus rhythm on that day, I went into sudden cardiac arrest for 10-20 minutes and was transported to the local hospital emergency room via ambulance where I was held for approximately 24 hours for observation and testing.  Since that sudden cardiac arrest event, I have experienced two more afib episodes to date, one on 4/26/21 lasting 8 hours and one on May 5, 2021 lasting 6.5 hours.  While I have experienced afib in the past due to a virus attacking my heart in 2018, I had not had any afib episodes for 14 months and had built my ejection fraction back up to 60-65% over a three-year period.  I have never experienced afib episodes with such frequency since my initial conversion to sinus rhythm three years ago following the virus attacking my heart until I received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine along with never, ever experiencing sudden cardiac arrest following the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

                                                bilateral subsegmental PTEs; right flank pain under ribs; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable HCP.  A 64-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number EW0153), via an unknown route, on 30Apr2021 (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy/drug store. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 before vaccination. Relevant medical history included hypertension (HTN), gout and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD). No relevant concomitant medications were provided. The patient did not have allergies. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. The patient presented to the emergency room (ER) with right flank pain under ribs. Found to have bilateral subsegmental pulmonary thromboembolisms (PTEs). The onset date of the events was provided as 20May2021. Both events were reported serious because requiring hospitalization for 3 days (admission date not provided) and as life-threatening conditions. The patient was treated with enoxaparin then apixaban. Nasal swab was done on 21May2021 and resulted negative. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number EW0172) on 21May2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was treated with enoxaparin then apixaban. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of all reported events cannot be totally excluded.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 24 hours, my right foot swelled, especially the middle of the sole, but also the toes and top of the foot. After a two-week delay due to a misdiagnosis by my PCP, I was seen at an urgent care center. An ultrasound of the right leg discovered a blood clot. I was placed on Eliquis 10 mg twice a day for the next 7 days followed by 5 mg twice a day. After 7 days, the swelling was reduced by 90%. The swelling has remained at that level since then. I changed my PCP on May 21 and was cleared for most activities. She advised me to continues with the Eliquis for three months from May 3, with no need for further testing.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular on 08Apr2021 at the age of 64-years-old (Batch/Lot Number: ER8729) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation, diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction all from an unknown date (HFrEF). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. It was unknown if the patient diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown if the patient had been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 08Apr2021, the patient experienced post-syncopal episode, hypotensive, CHF (Congestive heart failure) exacerbation and sepsis. Diagnosed: pyelonephritis and E.coli bacteremia, given abx coverage. 11Apr nephrostomy tube placed. 20Apr patient stable to discharge to LTAC. The patient was hospitalized for the events from 08Apr2021 to 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken included antibiotics, fluid, cardizem, nephrostomy tube. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available clinical data, reported events were most likely intercurrent medical conditions not related to vaccination with BNT162B2. Patient&#39;s history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation and heart failure are known risk factors for the occurrence of events that patient experienced.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 64-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EN6208, Exp 30Jun2021) via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 16Apr2021 11:00AM (at the age of 64-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included heart disease ongoing from 1997 (this happened in 1997 and the patient had been living with it for a little while), heart attack, pacemaker defibrillator because of cardiac arrest (in 2011), atrial fibrillation (diagnosed a little while, he was not sure and had been in and out of the hospital and to heart doctor quite a bit) and hypertension. The patient was administered with first shot of BNT162b2 (Lot number EW0153) in left shoulder on 16Mar2021 11:00AM (at the age of 64-year-old). Concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Apr2021 after the second dose, the patient was fine. There were no reactions after the first dose, but the second dose two days after he started developing a cough and fever. He thought it was a side effect but then ended up in the ER with pneumonia. They gave him antibiotics and sent him home. He went through the antibiotics and went back because he was still sick and not responding. They gave him more antibiotics and sent him home. He went through that batch and ended up really bad so he had to call an ambulance a few weeks later. He was diagnosed with MRSA Pneumonia and stayed in the hospital for 5 days. Then, he was discharged. He went back to the ER again a few days later because he did not seem to be improving.  He was coughing and was weak. He was given another batch of antibiotics. He did not know if it was from the shot or what - he was healthy until then. The patient added that she lost 20 pounds and confirmed that it was following the vaccine. Two days after the vaccine, maybe it was 19Apr2021, he had a fever and it was now gone (exact dates were unknown). Cough happened at the same time of the fever but it was not as bad, and then progressively got worse. His lungs started filling up. They thought it was COVID. by the x-rays it looked like COVID lung but they took a sample and it was MRSA (exact dates were unknown). His admission was 18May2021 and was for acute respiratory failure with hypoxia. Discharge paperwork said acute chronic combined systolic diastolic congestive heart failure but he has had that for many years.  It also stated primary hypertension but he has had that. The paperwork sayid pneumonia due to MRSA and pneumonia due to unspecified organism. He was hospitalized 18May2021 through 23May2021 with pneumonia and the reason he was hospitalized was because he could not breathe. Lost 20 pounds: after he started getting sick from the beginning of it all, he was coughing and losing weight and all that.  It may not be quite 20 pounds, maybe 17, but he just knew that he was down quite a bit. He was 160s now, he was high 170s before (as reported). Treatment included Lasix and all kinds of different antibiotics. They were giving him, he did not know what it was, at first. Then, they narrowed it down and once they found out it was MRSA they gave him Clindamycin he believes. Investigations: they did CT scans, chest X-rays, and labs but he does not know any information. Each time they did a chest x-ray, when he went to get a chest x-ray, each one was worse all the way up to when he was admitted. When he went, they did a bronchial scope or whatever, he was not sure, and they saw lots of swelling and infiltrate. He did not know what this meant, stuff was infiltrating into the tissue and it was not just in the airways. He added it looked like ground glass pneumonia is what they said. The patient added that he was usually pretty active and cannot do anything anymore. He had three or four Covid tests, all negative, no additional details provided. Outcome of the events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed. Further information is expected.

Medical history included Heart Condition (around 1997-1999), High Blood Pressure (all about the same time), Aneurysm (about 2017, 2015-2017 area. He wants to say 2015, because he was there when he found out about them) and open heart surgery (about 1997, 1995, somewhere around there). Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Apr2021 (at age of 64-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s): Caller states not that he knows of. All he knows from the emergency technician is that it looked like he went back to his car and his dog was in the car and he dropped dead. According to you guy&#39;s thing, it says muscle cramps, muscle pains and chest pains are all side effects of this and he does believe that the vaccine contributed to the chest pain which contributed to the heart attack that exploded his heart. He states his dad took the shot and died 3 days later (18May2021, also reported as died on Memorial day weekend. He died on Sunday). Caller stated the coroner&#39;s has already stated that he died by the coronavirus shot and mucked up his arteries, his heart. It is pretty sad. He was doing something he enjoyed, watching the races, gets up takes two steps, falls dead in his tracks. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. He does not know Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect, but he highly doubts it. Events not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office.   Information about lot/batch number is requested.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: His dad took the shot and died 3 days later, mucked up his arteries, his heart: Death

A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: eh9899), intramuscular on 21Dec2020 at 15:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at hospital. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. No other vaccine was given within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not receiving concomitant medications. Medical history included ongoing paroxysmal afib (atrial fibrillation). The patient has known allergies to squid. The patient reported having a long history of paroxysmal afib, very fit, play tennis at the national level. Prior to vaccine have had 2-3 brief bouts of afib/year. Since getting first shot and again after the second shot, have had frequent afib/apc&#39;s (atrial premature contractions) at least 6 episodes. Adverse event start date was reported as 21Dec2020 at 02:00 AM (pending clarification). No treatment was given for the event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event is considered possibly related to the suspect product based on the reportedly positive temporal association in a subject with a positive medical history of atrial arrhythmias. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

On the day pt was vaccinated, his sister picked him up for the appointment and pt refused a wheelchair. Pt walked into the clinic on his own and recevied his vaccine. Sister reported pt walked to the car after his vaccine and was winded. She dropped him off at his house and called him later to check up on him. Pt stated he was feeling fine but his arm was sore. Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied. Pt coded in parking lot of Doctor&#39;s Office and passed away at 4:31 p.m.

                                                Patient has substantial bilateral lung PE 12 days post vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (at the age of 65 years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included allergies: penicillin and testim. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. The patient had substantial bilateral lung PE (pulmonary embolism) 12 days post vaccination on 14Mar2021 (as reported, pending clarification). The event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization in Mar2021. Treatment of heparin infusion with rivaroxaban (XARELTO) initiation planned was received for the event. The patient had no covid prior vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. Outcome of event was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.

                                                stroke; stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (reporting for her husband). A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6202), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 11Mar2021 (at the age of 65years) as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, stroke from 03Dec2018 to an unknown date, and cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.

It was reported that the patient had a Covid vaccine this month on 11Mar2021. That was the 1st vaccine the patient had. Next day on the 12Mar2021, the patient stated having some unbalanced in walking and in his train of thinking. The reporter (nurse) ended up on 15Mar2021 taking the patient to Emergency room, and he had a stroke. The reporter stated, &#34;Now, he had a stroke 2 year before. I called to let you know I talked to the neurologist he has sent him to his family doctor for checkup and his family doctor wanted me to let you know that this happen. Does not know if there is any relation or not but just to let you all know and this coming Thursday, he is supposed to get his 2nd vaccine. I am, just calling to let you know&#34;. The patient was taking medication for his 1st stroke and now he is taking medication for his 2nd stroke (treatment). He is taking physical therapy and occupational therapy and for his cancer, he is taking medication for that. The patient was hospitalized for stroke from 15Mar2021 to 17Mar2021, then he was discharged. The outcome of event was not recovered.  Follow-up needed; further information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Event stroke represents an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2 .

                                                Patient was recently hospitalized for pulmonary embolism with acute cor pulmonale. First noticed increased shortness of breath on 4/4/21 when shoveling mulch and describes feeling &#34;more winded than usual&#34; with physical activity. He presented to the outpatient primary care clinic on 4/6/21 for evaluation and serum labs and TTE were ordered. Labs were notable for a WBC 13.22 and Cr 0.76. TTE showed hyperdynamic LV function with EF &gt;65% and no tricuspid regurgitation with no concern for right heart strain. A follow-up d-dimer was ordered and returned at 1661 resulting in the recommendation to present to the ED.    Upon presentation to the ED, he was hemodynamically stable with an SpO2 of 97% on room air. CT Chest PE protocol was ordered and showed multiple bilateral lobar, segmental, and subsegmental PE with findings suggestive of right heart enlargement was well as areas of pulmonary hemorrhage and developing infarcts. He was given a heparin bolus and he was admitted to the Adult Hospitalist Service.   The following morning, patient&#39;s hemoglobin remained stable and he continued to feel clinically well. He was transitioned from the heparin infusion to subcutaneous enoxaparin.  He was discharged on 4/9/21 with a plan for self-injection of enoxaparin and close follow-up with his PCP.

                                                I have had Paroxysmal AFib since 2012 and had an ablation in 2016.  It cured the Afib about 90-95 percent, but I still get intermittent episodes, ALWAYS brought on by some catalyst, (alcohol, sexual relations, drinking a cold beverage, exercise).  However, appr. two weeks after the vaccine, I began getting random bouts of Afib, longer in episodes, but shorter in duration.  Since the vaccine, I have had appr. 12&#43; episodes of Afib, occurring at various times, even at rest.  Since the ablation, I got about 12 episodes per year, now it&#39;s been 12 episodes in 2 months.  Sometimes, I&#39;ll get several episodes a day, at random times for no reason.  This has been totally opposite of what I was experiencing pre-vaccine.  What concerns me is that the episodes are random and there are not catalysts to bring them on.

                                                Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 65-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, bleeding ulcer and helicobacter pylori infection both from 15Feb2021, and ongoing tumor on his heart. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 in the left arm on 26Feb2021 (lot number: EN6203) for COVID-19 immunisation. Right before he had his first shot, he was in the hospital on 15Feb2021 with a bleeding ulcer and a helicobacter pylori infection. He had been in the hospital and isn&#39;t sure what all they gave him then. The patient started lisinopril 4 or 5 years ago when he was diagnosed with high blood pressure. His blood pressure was under control with the lisinopril but the patient is no longer on it. The patient&#39;s father had a stroke when he was 42 but he had high blood pressure and didn&#39;t get it treated. The patient got up around 07:00 in the morning on 27Mar2021. The patient&#39;s wife got up at 08:30 when she realized something was wrong. The patient said when he got up around 07:00, he experienced his right side being numb. The patient went to the emergency room and was treated there. He had a stroke. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 to 30Mar2021. The patient&#39;s wife doesn&#39;t know if it has anything to do with the shot. After his stroke, they put him on &#34;carvilo&#34;. When the patient was in the hospital for the stroke, they found other issues. He has a tumor in his heart that&#39;s a pretty good size and the doctor said it had been there for awhile. So, they put her husband on &#34;carvilo&#34; to help with his blood pressure and his heart. She doesn&#39;t think the tumor had anything to do with the shot because the doctor did say the size of the tumor was as big as it was because it had been there a while. They found the tumor while trying to find out why he had the stroke. They still haven&#39;t found a reason as to why he had the stroke. The tumor is on the right side of his heart and they said they didn&#39;t think that had anything to do with the stroke. The tumor was found on 28Mar2021. They did an MRI and a CT scan on his head when he was in the emergency room (ER) on 27Mar2021. They also did an ultrasound on his heart, chest, and abdomen. Since he&#39;s been out, they did an MRI on his heart. They also did X-rays on his lungs. He is getting ready to go back to the hospital for open heart surgery on 07May2021. Outcome of the event was unknown.

Pt was noted to have PEA at that time.   Pt was intubated and vented in ICU.  Pt was cooled x24 hours (unsure of protocol name) and rewarmed over 24 hours more.  Pt was weaned from all paralytics, etc.  Per RN reports, pt failed all neuro tests except R eye went from 3 &gt; 2 mm (4/29 &#43;).  Pt was transitioned to comfort care on 4/30 and passed within 5 minutes.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization. On 04May2021, the patient was found unresponsive by family, taken to Emergency department where left intracerebral brain hemorrhage was diagnosed.  His platelets were 46 and systolic blood pressure 220.  He has right hemiparesis and is only responsive to touch and pain. He is currently on hospice. The patient was hospitalized for 3 days and received platelet transfusion. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely  that the reported events were causally related to bnt162b2 .  The patient&#39;s history of hypertension is a risk factor for the reported left intracerebral brain hemorrhage and. blood pressure systolic increased.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received

He was fine all day long, fine since the second shot. We don?t believe the vaccine was the cause but maybe it jumpstarted something.  We wanted to alert someone for knowledge or research. We did not have an autopsy.

He presented to hospital emergency department on 5/23. They recommended COVID test, but patient refused and he was discharged home. He re-presented to ED on 5/26 and was admitted and treated for bacterial pneumonia with CTX/Azithromycin. During that admit he was newly diagnosed with Atrial fibrillation. Discharged on Eliquis. He then re-presented on 6/2 and tested positive for COVID. Pt got upset with the diagnosis, refused care, and left hospital. His daughter lives in the northwest suburbs, so she brought him to Hospital, where patient also tested positive for COVID on 6/4 and was admitted for COVID treatment (noted to be hypoxic (89% O2 sat) on room air).

Examination and blood tests showed sudden elevation of blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, throid, liver and kidney values, all of which subsequently decline and returned to usual levels after treatment and release from hospital (02/24/2021).  Arrythmia has not been detected since and other measurement/blood indicators are back down/under control.  Only residual symptoms are  slight loss of speed of operation f/righ arm/hand and confirmed &#34;moderate leakage in both heart valves&#34;.

                                                Cerebral venous thrombosis; bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage in the left, greater than the right; tonic-clonic seizure; brain swelling/cerebral edema; headaches; overall imbalance/having balance problems; he had a decline; kind of getting worse/ had the worst symptoms; His prostate is enlarged; patient&#39;s mental status is altered; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6203) as 0.3 ml single for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at vaccination was 65 years old. Medical history included hyperlipidemia and high cholesterol. Historical vaccine included 1st dose of BNT162B2 (LOT: EL3247) on 03Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. Concomitant medication included pravastatin (strength: 10 mg) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. Reporter did not know all of the symptoms that the patient had and cannot get the history, because the patient&#39;s mental status was altered (from unknown date in 2021). It was reported that he was having symptoms for at least 2 weeks with some increasing over the last 2 weeks. Knew that he had an overall imbalance and was having headaches, both from unknown date in May2021. He had been having symptoms for weeks and went to his doctor as an outpatient. He had initial imaging that was concerning and he went to the hospital because he had a decline (from unknown date in 2021). He had declined and had a hemorrhagic hemorrhage with cerebral venous thrombosis, both from 04Jun2021. He was admitted to the hospital 04Jun2021, and 05Jun2021 he was transferred to the ICU. He had declined since his initial presentation and had been kind of getting worse over the last couple of weeks. Stated the patient was stoic and does not have a lot of medical problems, but everyone knew he was having symptoms over the last 2 weeks. 02Jun2021 he had the worst symptoms and was basically having balance problems. He was getting concerned and had called to get an appointment with his primary care physician. They had done an outpatient CT scan which found the cerebral venous thrombosis and he went to the hospital and was placed on Heparin. While in the hospital, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and had further decline on 04Jun2021. Repeat imaging showed that he had bilateral intracerebral hemorrhaging, the left greater than the right, and they had expanded a bit. He was still on heparin and now (Jun2021) had some cerebral edema due to it but was not on a ventilator. He was still in the time period where he was continuing to have small declines. He was therapeutic on heparin. He had a central line and was getting hypertonic saline for the brain swelling and cerebral edema. Patient previous health condition was reported as he did not have a real significant past medical history. He maybe carried a diagnosis of hyperlipidemia and high cholesterol. He was pretty healthy; regularly went to the doctor and was otherwise pretty stable. Reporter did not even think his LDL was that high. He had never been on any blood thinners or anything like that. They did a full scan to look for cancer and had no history of blood clots. They did a scan that was negative for any types of masses or any concerns for cancer. His prostate was enlarged (from unknown date in 2021) and they had spoken to the family about it and they said he had been worked up with a biopsy which had been negative. Physician Office? Yes, He was directly admitted to the hospital from primary care. He presented to the clinic because he had these symptoms and headaches. The imaging was done and then he was admitted. He never went through the emergency room. Cerebral venous thrombosis, bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage, overall imbalance/having balance problems, he had a decline, headaches resulted in Physician Office Visit. Outcome of cerebral venous thrombosis, bilateral intracerebral hemorrhage was not resolved; outcome of tonic-clonic seizure, brain swelling/cerebral edema, headache, overall imbalance/having balance problems, he had a decline, kind of getting worse/ had the worst symptoms, enlarged prostate and mental status was altered was unknown. Causality: Cerebral venous thrombosis: Can&#39;t say for sure because reporter does not know the timeline but can&#39;t find any other reason, he would have cerebral venous thrombosis.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events cerebral venous thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, tonic-clonic seizure, and brain swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.

A 66-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL1284) at arm, left upper, via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 06:15 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) formally diagnosed around Jan2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported he got the COVID-19 Vaccine at 06:15 on 29Dec2020 and had to sit for 15 minutes afterwards before he could leave. He said everything was fine, and he walked out to the hospital lobby, and was speaking with a work associate for 10 minutes before he headed to his car. When he got ready to leave, he got in his car, and started his car. He started driving home, and realized he was in AFIB. He did have an AFIB issue. His AFIB has been pretty well controlled for a year now, as long as, he didn&#39;t do something stupid. He had a moderately aggressive run of AFIB. He said his &#34;smart&#34; watch told him his heart rate was 117. His normal heart rate is around 60-70. He was in AFIB for about 3 hours. His typical runs of AFIB are considerably shorter. He only had a total of 2 episodes of AFIB in the last year. His prior AFIB episodes would have been about 4-5 minutes. The last time he had AFIB that lasted any length of time was when he was hospitalized for AFIB around Jan2020. He said at that time, he was hospitalized overnight for observation. He received medication during the hospitalization and his AFIB broke. He didn&#39;t remember what medications were given to him during the hospitalization. He said he had flutters before that hospitalization, but the flutters were always gone after a few minutes, so he never sought treatment because there would be nothing to treat. The patient reported he noticed the rest of the day on 29Dec2020, right up to going to bed that he felt cold. His house wasn&#39;t cold, and he didn&#39;t have a fever. He said the cold feeling went away during the night while he was sleeping. He said the cold feeling easily lasted for a 12 hours. He said the cold feeling could have been something else. The outcome of &#34;he was in afib for about 3 hours after receiving his first dose of the covid19 vaccine&#34; was recovered on 29Dec2020; of &#34;he noticed the rest of the day, right up to going to bed that he felt cold&#34; was recovered on 30Dec2020.

They felt he could have had a TIA, or extension of a prior CVA (nothing new on MRI, has small vessel ischemic disease), or a COVID vaccine reaction. Symptoms have mostly resolved, he is not always cooperative so subtle weakness is difficult to detect. He was hospitalizaed, started on ASA &amp; increased BP meds, and returned to his home, where he has resided for several years.

At 8pm, my heart was racing very fast and took blood pressure,  It was very high, 152/105 pulse 74.  I called 24hr nurse on call.  She said call 911. Ambulance was on site within 5 minute and transported me to hospital.  I was in the ER at least 6 hours, moderating my heart.  They said I had an A FIB attack.  They got it down and admitted me to the hospital.  I also experienced pain in my bladder, I could not urinate.  They had to drain it 2 times.  I was released from the hospital at 8pm the next day.  Any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me or my doctor.

The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

                                                Friday April 2, 2021 ? Got Phizer COVID shot at noon.  No reactions that day  Saturday 4/3 ? Woke up to body aches, fatigue, and sweats.  Fever of 100.4 most of the day. ? Stayed in bed and slept until 6:00.  Did not eat or drink much today. ? Felt dizzy when I got up.  Drank water and had 2 bananas and ½ a bowl of chicken soup. ? Felt the same all day.    Easter Sunday 4/4  ? Felt better but still fatigued.  Body aches were not as bad, and temp was normal. ? Drank a lot more water and had a little to eat in the morning. ? Kids came over for Easter Brunch.  We ate about 11:00. ? Whenever I stood up quickly, I got very dizzy.  Happened quite a few times throughout the day (I never had this problem before). ? When walking into the kitchen from outside, I got very dizzy and could not get up the steps on my own, I just kind of stopped.  Did not black out but felt close.  The kids helped me in, and I sat down.   ? Drank more water and took it easy. ? The kids left about 2:00.  Before they left, friend told me to go to a fire station and have my blood pressure checked. ? 2nd friend took me to 3 fire stations before we found one open, south of hardware store? They were nice, took my blood pressure, oxygen level and an EKG. ? They thought I was experiencing A-FIB.  Told me to go to the emergency room right away.  Wanted me to go by ambulance but I told them 2 friend could take me.  They recommended medical center , which was better equipped for this.   ? Got to the emergency room about 4:30 and checked in. ? Nurse checked me out and asked a lot of questions.  I gave her the EKG print out from the fire station.   ? She had us go back to the waiting area and was going to talk with the doctor.  ? After a while they took us back to emergency ward and plugged in a saline bag and monitor.   ? They hooked me up to an EKG machine again and took a reading. ? The doctor. came in and diagnosed me with A-FIB and discussed what it is, what can happen and how to treat it. She said that this could be a temporary episode of A-FIB or it could be permanent. ? She put me on a blood thinner and had me make an appointment with my cardiologist, Dr.    Monday 4/5: ? Felt better got dizzy a couple of times but drank a lot of water and ate. ? Finally got the blood thinner prescription at about 4:00.  Tuesday - Friday: ? Kept drinking a lot of water.  No real issues with dizziness.

Long time delays occurred while scheduling further testing (CT and MRI). Summary from MRI:  &#34;Study Result Impression:  There is diffusion restriction along the left thalamus consistent with subacute ischemia, greater than 6 hours in etiology but less than 2 weeks.&#34;  Outcome:  Vision is slowly improving, headache is mostly gone, vertigo &amp;  mental status slowly improving.

PMHx notable for multiple prior TIAa, HTN, HLD, PVD c/b R femoral artery thrombus (2017, no intervention, on Plavix), T2DM (prior A1c 6.5%, recently 6.2% not on meds), COPD, prior splenectomy (childhood re: car accident), chronic L ulnar neuropathy, bilateral hearing loss, complex partial seizure disorder following Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Symptoms resolved fully within 24 hours of event; diagnosed with TIA. MRI without new ischemic findings; chronic small vessel disease and chronic small R cerebellar stroke noted. TIA likely occurred in setting of hypertensive event with systolic BP to 220s. ED attending reported an NIHSS of 9. Of note, blood pressure was in the 210s systolic on admission, and subsequently down trended. Per resident, initially had left gaze deviation however on exam had full ocular motility. Pupils were of equal (size: OD 3, S 3) and reactive. Ocular motility was full without nystagmus. Facial sensation normal. Initial mild left facial droop, which also resolved. As the exam progressed, the patient&#39;s symptoms began resolving. Patient was able to articulate his thoughts better without dysarthria and strength markedly improved in the left upper and lower extremities to full 5/5 strength within about 30-45 minutes. NIHSS improved from 9-1. Of note, the patient reported having several episodes similar in nature, in the setting of significant hypertension as well. Denied ever having a true stroke in the past.

He went to a clinic yesterday for a PCR test and it came out positive. He&#39;s getting conflicting information as to what needs to be done, some people are telling him he has to wait for 3 months, other are telling him to notify his PCP.

A 66-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 20Apr2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot Number: er8735) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, patient has been tested for COVID-19. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in facility. The patient experienced pinched middle finger, got a 1/4 diameter blood clot under skin on 09May2021 13:00. Patient was scheduled to go there tomorrow for the second dose. Had an accident yesterday and pinched the right middle finger. Usually when that happens, he gets a boil and it fills with a clear liquid pus. This time, it turned into a giant blood clot, well not giant but about a quarter inch in diameter in the tip of his finger. He has never had that happen before. He may have never damaged his finger in that way before. That is why it turned into a blood clot and not clear fluid. Patient was worried a little with the blood clot because he knew it has been an issue. When he first got a little worried about the blood clot, he thought he would take 2 aspirin and it might thin the blood a little bit. Patient ate some pineapple because he heard that was a blood thinner too. No treatment received for event. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab: negative on 10Jun2020. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 66-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Lot Number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right deltoid (reported as right arm) on 26Mar2021 at 03:55 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included two stunts in the right leg (1 in thigh and 1 in calf) on an unknown date. The patient had no allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 24Feb2021 (lot number:EN6201), intramuscular in the right arm at 65 years of age. The patient went to his vascular doctor on an unspecified date (reported as 05Oct2021) and 3 clots were discovered on the groin area of the left leg. The MD said it did not warrant going to the ER. The patient has two stunts in the right leg (1 in thigh and 1 in calf) and reported that it had been uncomfortable but not painful. The MD placed him on Eliquis 10 mg, BID for 7 days then reduced the dose at 5 mg BID thereafter for about 5 months. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: &#34;The causal association of the events of clots on the groin area of the left leg&#39; and leg uncomfortable&#39; with the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded due to limited information in the case. The case will be reassessed once new information is available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.&#34;

A 66-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm upper muscle on 02Apr2021 11:45 at age of 66-year-old (Lot Number: ER8737) as 2nd dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Historical vaccine included first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, LOT number was EN6204) for Covid-19 immunisation in Mar2021, at age of 66-year-old and experienced pain in the arm. Medical history included Barrett&#39;s esophagus, Diverticulitis, Gastrooesophageal reflux disease, Generalised anxiety disorder, Cataracts, Kidney stones, Chlamydial infection, Left ventricular hypertrophy, Vertigo, hiatal hernia repair done, hypertension, had a colonoscopy quite often in another words to remove the polyps from his colon. Concomitant medication included omeprazole taken for GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease) and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient experienced atrial fibrillation on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, mild stroke on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, went totally blind in my left eye on 09Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered, probably got macular degeneration on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown, pain in the arm on 02Apr2021 with outcome of unknown , my skin was kind of different looking you know like aging a little bit you know like wrinkling on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown , seeing flash burn every once in a while on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown , have a obstruction in the main artery of left eye on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CAT scan and EKG both with unknown results on 24May2021. The events result in Physician Office Visit, no treatment was received.  Clinical course: Consumer stated, &#34;Well, I got my first Pfizer shot I just thought I should just call and discuss this with somebody bit of some sheet I got I got the Pfizer vaccine and I got that one on 15Mar2021 the first one and then I received the second one 02Apr2021 and when after I received the second one I had the pain in the arm like normal but it was a lot more severe than I got from the first one but it went away but you know normal 3 to 4 days it went away so I did not wasn&#39;t that concerned but I also know this to ask. After I got my skin was kind of different looking you know like aging a little bit you know like wrinkling but then all of a sudden it cleared up too that went away probably about the same time a week after I got the shot I started having vision problem(distorted voice and incomplete sentence). I visited an ophthalmologist an regular eye doctor it was an ophthalmologist (distorted voice and incomplete sentence) and he said no I don&#39;t see that you have a stroke I don&#39;t see that you have vision problems with your retina this time you probably got macular degeneration going on so anyways he said comeback if you have an issue then I said so you are telling me that even though my vision is going in my left eye I am not gonna go blind and I didn&#39;t have a stroke he said yes. Ok, so anyways exactly a month after that I went totally blind in my left eye my vision came back, my vision came back. I forgot to tell you my vision came back fully for a while but it was different in my left eye like I was seeing flash burn every once in a while when I was in the sunlight and stuff. Anyway a month later after I got the second shot when I went totally blind in my left eye and so I got upset about the doctor&#39;s here and I had to go to (Address) to pick my new eyeglasses anyway so I had to drive to (Address) with one eye which is 230 miles from me anyways, so when I got my glasses there at they were the right prescription thank god and I told them about the eye issue so they didn&#39;t throw a eye test really thorough and said yes I definitely see a problem in your left eye looks like a flash burn or something like that so then they had me setup an appointment with really good ophthalmologist in (Address) because I wanted a second opinion whether my insurance covered it or not. So I went to this retinal specialist and I was in his office for like 3 hours they were checking me out in there you know he said yes definitely you have an obstruction in the main artery of your left eye and that&#39;s why you lost your vision and this doctor said there&#39;s only two things it could be it it could be you had a stroke or that you had a bad reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and so anyway he wanted me to go either into the emergency room a good (Address) to further do testing, I said no I don&#39;t wanna do that because that&#39;s all out of my own pocket that would have been thousands of dollars you know, but I don&#39;t know I am all confused about this medical care. I am just trying to give you all a scenario from day 1 going forward you know anyway so I refused to go to good (Name) and he said well it should be okay anyway because it&#39;s been so much time since the original problem that you would be probably alright to just back to your hometown there and go to the hospital and have your testing then there I did and the next day I got back to (Address) from (Address) I went  to the hospital there they did an EKG on my heart and they did a CAT scan on my head and they said they couldn&#39;t see anything from the EKG or the CAT scan that I had but that doesn&#39;t mean you didn&#39;t have(Incomplete sentence), so they said you could have a mild stroke and you know anyway we want you to go further testing well I had a primary care physician appointment two weeks later which is still coming up so I have to her so they want to order an MRI and some other tests on my heart because they think I have might have an AFib atrial fibrillation where the blockage I mean where the blood flow properly to my heart you know if I want to do those tests too but I am just letting you know this cause the one doctor said it could be that you have the eye problem because of the vaccine that&#39;s what I am calling you about.&#34; Consumer Stated, &#34;Yes, you can follow up sure because I am more anyway cause on the 09June2021 I have an appointment with my primary care physician which is the one that have to do the order in heart chest and the MRI and the following week. I am going back to (Address) to that Ophthalmologist that said that it might because of Pfizer vaccine I am going back to him I got a follow up with him because he wants to me to take care of my eye issue so maybe I can get my eye sight back in other words or so.&#34; Date adverse event started: Consumer stated, &#34;I had my first shot on Friday 02Apr2021. The exact day that I started having issues was exactly one week later on 09Apr2021. Other than the normal you now pain in the arms because that started and went away normal that started you know. Well that started basically right after I got the shot on 02Apr2021 with the pain and the arm thing that was right after I got the shot 02Apr2021 and it was the little bit more severe than the original shot. 09Apr2021 is when I stated having eye problem.&#34; Anatomical Sites of administered: Consumer Stated, &#34;The first one I had them do it in my right arm in the muscle top in my right arm and the second one was done in the left arm upper muscle.&#34; Other Medical Conditions: Consumer Stated, &#34;Nothing life threatening but I have chronic health conditions, quite a few of them. I got Barrett&#39;s esophagus, then Diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon then electro cardiogram(Further not clarified) they did was abnormal they said. I got GRD Gastroesophageal reflux disease. I got generalized anxiety disorder, GAD. I have Cataracts. They said I had a genital disorder I don&#39;t know what that means. I got history of Calculus in the kidneys, kidney stones but I haven&#39;t had a problem with that from quite a while, I changed my diet. I have past Chlamydial infection which is an STD. I had hiatal hernia repair done, so surgery. I have hypertension disorder they say, left ventricular hypertrophy which I guess has something to do with the heart, I think that&#39;s why they wanna do more test of my heart. I got polyps in colon (Further not clarified) and occasionally I get Vertigo so I have to have a colonoscopy quite often in another words to remove the polyps from my colon.&#34; Treatment medication for medical conditions: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well they only I take Vitamin D3 and I take Vitamin C but that&#39;s vitamins basically the only meds and I am taking. I am using Eye Drops right now over the counter stuff basically the only meds I really take is Omeprazole which is for my GRD disorder you know my gas my stomach gas it controls my stomach gas and then extra strength Tylenol I take that as needed sometimes.&#34; Start date of taking the medication: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well the Omeprazole I probably been taking that for 10 years at least 8 years or 7 years. I really couldn&#39;t give that to you without going through a pile of paper work.&#34; When asked about if consumer is taking any other medication, consumer Stated, &#34;No, Just Omeprazole.&#34; Lab test: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well they did an EKG and they did a CT scan and that was just recently because of my issue that I got right now going on. Yeah, that was done at (Name).&#34; Date of test: 24May2021. Result of test: Consumer Stated, &#34;Only the doctor has that I don&#39;t have that I have to go to my primary physician on 09May2021 to get those results.&#34; Event Details: Event Date: Consumer Stated, &#34;When I had the first shot I didn&#39;t have any side effects at all except for the minor arm pain.&#34; When confirmed event date as 02Apr2021 and 09Apr2021, consumer stated, &#34;Yes that&#39;s when I started having adverse side effects.&#34; Still experiencing the problem: Consumer Stated, &#34;Yeah, I am still blind in my left eye yes.&#34; Outcome: Consumer Stated, &#34;Well I don&#39;t know it&#39;s kind of early if they are gonna improve or not they want to do more testing the doctor know more when they did more tests I don&#39;t have all the information because they still doing test on me to figure out what&#39;s going on but I decided to call you know before it got too late in the whole situation you know.&#34; Treatment: Consumer took for the adverse events consumer stated, &#34;No I don&#39;t think they gave me any drugs or anything for the tests.&#34; Consumer hung up abruptly hence further probing could not be done.

                                                Resident was vaccinated on 12/31/20. Then on 1/14/21 he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine surveillance PCR testing.  Another resident on the same hall was COVID positive on 1/11/21.  Results of the PCR test were obtained on 1/16/21.  He appeared asymptomatic at that time. Given his COVID positive status, all aerosol generating procedures had to be stopped. Overnight on 1/16/21 into 1/17/21, he had the onset of acute respiratory failure and was transported to the hospital. Per notes, he was put on BiPAP for several hours, but his CO2 level did not improve. Per prior advance directives completed with the resident and his two brothers, he had DNR/DNI orders.  The hospital physician spoke with his brother and the decision was made to  move to comfort care. He was discharged to inpatient hospice and died around 4pm on 1/18/21. This outcome does not appear to be vaccine-related, but death from COVID-19 infection is listed as a reportable event following COVID-19 vaccination.

Symptoms began about 1 day after vaccination and continued for about two weeks. About 8 days after vaccination, the patient sought medical attention and was diagnosed with the lab derangements noted above, PLT 120 and WBC 2.6. Covid test negative at that time. He was first seen by me about one week after that where his blood counts had improved but not normalized and he was still having some symptoms. He was last seen by me today, 3/30/21 and now asymptomatic and blood counts normalized.  No specific treatment was done.

It was unknown if treatment was received for the adverse events. The events were considered non-serious by the patient. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was unknown.

They went away in 3 more days.  3 days after second dose (given 3/12/21) I started having heart palpitations and shortness of breath again.  Went to GP and diagonosed with A Fib.  Went to cardiologist who confirmed A fib.  Cardiologist said I was the second patient that day presenting with A Fib following a dose of Pfizer.   Now after 5 weeks I am getting slowly better but still have some A fib.

                                                found down unconscious; unwitnessed fall; oxygen was in the 60s; submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli; right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein; some degree of right heart dysfunction; blood sugar very high; A1C elevated; Haptoglobin elevated; elevated troponin; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 67-year-old male patient received second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, at the age of 67-year-old, on 25Feb2021, as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included Traumatic brain injury at the age of 29 which resulted in a CVA (right sided stroke)because the hospital did not know how to give Mannitol, behavioral problems in 2008, run over by a train in 2008, wears two AFOs (one on the left leg from having a right sided stroke, he also wears one on his left leg from having a stroke with right sided weakness, the right AFO was worn since he was 29, and then the other one he started wearing in 2008 when he was run over by a train and almost had his leg severed and he wears a left AFO), dementia diagnosed 4-5 years ago, head surgeries, depression, affective disorder, anxiety. The patient had multiple hospitalizations, and he has hyper reflexivity like all brain patients have. The patient has no history of blood clots or emboli. Concomitant medications included olanzapine (ZYPREXA) taken for depression and oxcarbazepine (TRILEPTAL) taken for affective disorder and anxiety.  The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number not reported) single dose for covid-19 immunisation, pneumonia and flu vaccine in 2008 for immunization and has no reaction. The patient received his second dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and two weeks later he was found down/ was found down unconscious at the nursing home and his oxygen was in the 60&#39;s on 15Mar2021. The nursing home did not know if her brother hit his head because it was unwitnessed. The patient was found down, not responsive, and it was an unwitnessed fall. The patient was treated as a trauma patient and that this occurred around 10 oclock on 15Mar2021. At that time, he was transferred to a local hospital to the emergency room and put on oxygen. They transferred him within 4 hours because they did not know what to do. Caller adds that the hospital thought that he had a subdural hematoma but the hospital does not have a neuro radiologist, so the hospital transferred to the other hospital that somebody with head knowledge can look at his CAT scan. The patient was misdiagnosed with a subdural hematoma because there were changes in his CT scan from his 3 previous brain surgeries. The patient had a traumatic brain injury when he was 29, and experienced changes.  The patient was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli on 15Mar2021 described as central lobar sub segmental PEs in both lungs, PE was within the distal right main artery, pulmonary artery distal left main, left middle lobe, middle right lobe / upper right lower lobe and middle lobar, segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries. The patient also had pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery of left middle lobe and left lower lobe, pulmonary arteries. There was also some degree of right heart dysfunction which was diagnosed by contrast. On 15Mar2021, the patient also had right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein. The patient is in a nursing home, the doctor did not want to listen to the reporter because her brother is a nursing home patient and they just assume he is immobile but he is not.  The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included Blood sugar very high (they think it was because of heart strain and acute injury because then it came down down down), A1C elevated, Haptoglobin elevated, elevated troponin. These results were all elevated and from acute injury. At the time of the report, the patient is feeling better and needs less oxygen. The events found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism, right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein, and some degree of right heart dysfunction caused hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The reporter absolutely does believe the events and the suspect drug are correlated. Outcome of found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism was recovered on 18Mar2021 while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                On April 24, 2021, a vein in my arm swole up like a blood clot, the a cephalic vein. I started experiencing nerve burning and tingling in hands, arms and shoulders. The blood clot was in an area that I had damaged years ago and is now clogged. Today is 4/27/2021 and I still have the blood clot and tingling, sometimes in my face also, burning in the shoulder blades, very similar to symptoms of brachial neuritis. I am scheduled for my second shot on 5/4/2021, but thinking I may not get the shot since I am having so much trouble. I have an appointment schedule with a vascular doctor to have an arterial dopler on 5/6/2021, and have the vascular doctor advise.

                                                severe grand mal seizures; he only has half of his memory; some of his levels were high last week in his bloodwork; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8730 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 13:10 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid which he have had for 15 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine for hypothyroid which he had been taking for too long to remember, over 10 years. The patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206) in the left arm on 08Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter (patient&#39;s wife) called about the Pfizer vaccine for COVID 19. She called to report that her husband almost within 24 hours after receiving his second vaccine, he a had severe grand mal seizure and had to be hospitalized from 31Mar2021 to 02Apr2021. She confirmed that he have had severe grand mal seizures on 31Mar2021. She said that he did not regain conciousness afterwards and that this was within 24 hours after receiving the 2nd vaccination. When probed for end date, the reporter stated that they could not find anything wrong with him. She said he only has half of his memory on an unspecified date. There was a lasting memory effect. He is on seizure medications, he is not allowed to drive for 1 month because he had the seizure, he has a zoom call meeting with his doctor on 19Apr2021. She says not driving is a problem, he is trying to work from home. She said upper arm for shot location then consulted her husband in the background who said both shots were in his left arm. She said he takes low dose thyroid medication. She consulted her husband in the background for some information. After giving some information she says no he doesn&#39;t take anything else. He is never sick and he&#39;s never ever been hospitalized. This is his first time ever. She said her son says when the body gets into that condition, it enters fight-or-flight, he went into fight, 5 firefighters had to hold him so they could give him the calm-you-down medications in the ambulance. One was his son, he said that he had the power of 10 men. She said her husband doesn&#39;t remember any of it. She says he is very healthy. For investigation, she said, well everything turned out negative. She says he had a CT scan, MRI, EEG, bloodwork, urinalysis on an unspecified date in 2021 and they can&#39;t find anything wrong. She said that they just said everything was normal. She said some of his levels were high last week, on an unspecified date in 2021 in his bloodwork and his doctor wanted him to do bloodwork again in 3 weeks. She said several things were high. The events required a visit to emergency room. She said that the fire department took him. She did not visit the physician office until after he got out of the hospital where he saw his primary doctor. She said she wanted to include on the report that it scared the crap out of her. She said, she was holding his neck up and tilting his head up to make sure he was getting air. She wanted to let everyone know what happened. The outcome of the event Grand mal seizure was recovered with sequelae on an unspecified date while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

A 67-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 67 years). Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]); lisinopril; insulin taken for diabetes mellitus. The patient experienced thrombocytopenia, he had clot in the legs and in the lungs and have a low platelet count on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CBC: unknown result on 08Apr2021, Heparin associate antibody: unknown result, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP): unknown result and platelet count: low on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of thrombosis included Heparin drip and Argatroban. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are considered unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather intercurrent occurrences. Clots in the legs and in the lungs were likely favored by the mentioned diabetes and by a possible hyperlipidemia (the patient was taking  atorvastatin) in a setting of possible arterial hypertension (the patient was taking lisinopril).  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                A few days after the vaccine started feeling uncomfortable in the left leg.  It did not get better with rest and time so went to the ER and  an ultrasound and found a clot from the groin to the ankle.  He had no injury to preclude this clot.  He was put on an anticoagulant (Xarelto) and standing and walking is very painful.  He has a follow up appointment set with his PCP 5/6/21  He was told he might have to be on this medication for months maybe longer.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. It was reported that the patient had no known diseases or conditions. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications (&#34;other medications in two weeks&#34;) were reported as no. It was reported that the patient was not on any medications prior to the adverse events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced sore arm. On 25Mar2021 at 08:45 the patient experienced I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm and on an unspecified date the patient experienced typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID. The clinical course was reported as follows &#34;I had just sore arm after shot 1, but after shot 2 I went into a-fib. I also had the typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID and itchy inner arm.&#34; The adverse events I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm resulted in a physician office visit and the event I went into a-fib required treatment with blood thinner and calcium blocker. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination on 07Apr2021 with a nasal swab which was negative. The clinical outcomes of the events I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm were not recovered/not resolved and the clinical outcome of typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Atrial fibrillation cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 10:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included knee surgery, dislocated shoulder (he has dislocated that shoulder in the past several times but had no recent issues), carpal tunnel syndrome and, rheumatoid arthritis, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. In Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm opposite where he received the injection. He reported he like had a muscle tear that it has an intense excruciating pain. He took three aspirin and put a heating pad on it that didn&#39;t touch it. He then reported that the pain went to his knee and it &#34;got all blow up&#34; and stated that that knee had to be drained. He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

                                                was diagnosed with a heart attack at the hospital; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 67-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01May2021 at 14:00 (Lot Number: EW0173; Expiration Date: Aug2021) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included cardiac catherization, 2 weeks ago (Apr2021). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had his 1st dose of the Pfizer COVID Vaccine last Saturday, 01May2021 at 2:00PM and between 7:30 to 7:45 PM, he started having chest issues. He said he felt like something was pushing down on his chest, like he was having a heart attack. He sat and waited, and then the feeling got into his arm. He said as soon as the pain went into his arm, he knew it was a heart attack. He said he got 2 nitroglycerin and took them. He said the feeling in his chest and arm didn&#39;t go away, so he called 911, and an ambulance took him to the hospital and went to the ER. He said the first blood draw on 01May2021 that was done at the hospital didn&#39;t show anything. He said the second blood draw on 01May2021 showed his cardiac enzymes were elevated, and that he had a heart attack. He was diagnosed with a heart attack at the hospital. He said 2 weeks prior (Apr2021), he had a procedure done (clarified as a cardiac catheterization). He said his cardiologist checked his stents, and the stents were all OK, and there were no issues with his heart. He said his cardiologist just did the same procedure again (cardiac catheterization) on 01May2021, and it was normal, there was nothing there (in his heart). He said he was putting his heart attack as caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. He said he knows about a study that reported people were having heart attacks after getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. Clarified that he had a cardiac catheterization through his wrist while at the hospital, and it was same procedure he had 2 weeks earlier with his cardiologist. He said both cardiac catheterizations didn&#39;t show anything wrong with his heart. He was asking that if should he get the second dose if he had a side effect after the first dose of the vaccine. The patient was hospitalized for the event from 01May2021 to 04May2021. Outcome of the event was unknown.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                acute myocardial infarction; He was found by his secretary unconscious; feeling unwell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 19Jan2020 at 08:00, after the vaccine, that patient was at work and was feeling unwell and the patient was found by his secretary unconscious. An ambulance was called. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 79/38 and electrocardiogram showed acute myocardial infarction. He underwent one stent placement with the remaining arteries normal. He was also started on ticagrelor (BRILINTA), metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient immediately improved and was feeling well and resumed exercise. The clinical outcomes of the unconscious, acute myocardial infarction, and feeling unwell were recovering. The events required emergency room visit and were assessed as serious for requiring hospitalization for 2 days and being life-threatening.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events acute myocardial infarction, unconsciousness and feeling unwell are related to BNT162B2.  The events are more likely intercurrent medical condition for this elderly patient.

Also he was diagnosed with, it is 4 words and then leukemia and he had an appointment with doctor to get his blood drawn every 2 weeks. The neurosurgeon that did surgery on him on 09Jan2021 at 4 am said that his carotid artery in his neck was plugged and he went in and cleaned it out and put in a stent and he said that his carotid artery was plugged all the way to his temple and he tried to get that out and couldn&#39;t.

They had dinner at 5 pm and at 6pm they were sitting on the couch and all of sudden he started slurring his words and he said his mouth felt like someone give him Novocain and then he had his arm around her and all of sudden it felt like he was choking her so she grabbed his hand and his fingers started rolling up, started closing up tight so she started playing with his fingers and then he went out in the kitchen and then he hit the floor and she called # and the paramedics came up there. When they got there he could squeeze both hands and lift both feet by that time it was 7:30, they had just brought in a chair, by time they got done bringing in the chair they realized his left side was becoming paralyzed and so they had to go back and get the stretcher so they were there for about 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes then they headed up the hill toward the hospital at about 8pm and they came in and gave anti-blood clotting medicine and took him for a scan with dye, they found he still had a blockage on his brain so at 2AM on the 9th they came in with a medical helicopter and flew him to (institution name withheld) in (place name withheld) and they did an MRI on and seen his carotid blockage there so he had emergency surgery at from # that morning of the 09Jan2021 at (institution name withheld) and he was in ICU from Saturday until a week ago at 3 oclock 13Jan2021 he was placed in a regular room and on the 19Jan2021 at 7:30PM he was moved (hospital name) in (place name withheld) for 14 days having 15 hours per day of therapy for a week and then he will go to (place name withheld) (rehab name withheld) and he could be there 2-3 weeks.

                                                Upon my return home, I felt very dizzy, weak, nearly  fainted, where  a sensation ran through the left side of the body. I then was assisted to the bed, where my left arm and left leg felt numb. I rested assuming this would fade away, being I has some numbness from the 1st vaccine.  On 3/24/21, as I attempted to get up from the bed,   I could not maintain my  balance and gait. The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

                                                I had no reactions after my first Pfizer injection.  2 Days after my second injection my right calve started to hurt.  This grew increasingly worse each day to where walking was painful.   A week later on Monday,  March 15 my left knee started to hurt and then my left calf.  On Tuesday, March 16 I went to the Hospital Emergency room.  They did a number of tests and one of them was ultrasound of both of my legs.  They found DVTs in both legs and started me on Lovenox injections.   About 5 years ago I had a DVT in my right leg but never had any pain or other adverse symptoms from this DVT.  Also I was taking Xarelto to prevent any further DVTs.  On Saturday, March 20 I went back to the ER because my leg pain was still bad.  They did new leg ultrasounds and the DVTs were gone.  My left knee still hurts and my doctor is trying to find out why.   Anyway none of this may be related to the vaccine, but everyone is curious of why I would get these new DVTs when I was taking Xarelto daily and I had never had a problem for 5 years.  The other odd thing is that i had so much pain when my prevous DVT had no pain symptoms.  So now I am continuing the Lovenox injections and we are trying to determine why my left knee is still in so much pain.  It might be something like arthritis in that knee but it seems like such a coincedence that it happened at the same I got these DVTs and I have no history of joint pain anywhere in my body, not even any back pain.

                                                Chills; seems to have some kind of hypothermia/kept reading 94.7; hemorrhoids; pulmonary embolism in his right lower lobe; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient).  A 68-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 68-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included paraplegic, he has been paralyzed for 45 years. The patient received first dose of the vaccine on 10Feb2021 with lot number: EN5318, expiration 31May2021. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient went on Monday to the ER for an unrelated condition and they did a CT scan and found a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism in his right lower lobe. He confirms the pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on Monday, 15Mar2021.  He got home that night and read the headline in the (Withheld) times that said several European countries are pulling the Astra Zeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots even though there has not been any causal relationship found. He thought that with the drug companies, they should be able to have data regarding potential adverse effects for Pfizer so he was calling report that. He discusses it with the ER doctor and he couldn&#39;t really figure out why he had a blood clot, it was incidental to what he was being scanned for, it surprised him. They put him on Eliquis so he is on an anticoagulant, which will cost him a fortune. Today will be the third day he has been on the Eliquis. He is at home and he would say his only concern is that he does have hemorrhoids so when he has bowel movement tomorrow, because he doesn&#39;t go every day, but when he goes he is concerned if he starts to bleed that the anti-coagulant might cause the bleeding to be more significant than it usually is. No further information provided. His only other concern is he seems to have some kind of hypothermia, he is not entirely sure because of his thermometer is not very good. That is the reason he went into the Emergency Department because it kept reading 94.7 and he googled it and it said if it is below 95 it is a medical emergency and go to the ER so he got to the Emergency Department and it was 97.6 and now he checked his temperature again with the thermometer and it was 96.8 so either he has a faulty thermometer or something but he is experiencing some kind of chills.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

The second shot had the same symptoms as the first but after about 22 hours I apparently had some type of anaphylactic reaction - I remember going to the bathroom - but I woke up on the floor by the bed, and could not think how to get back in bed.  My wife called 2 neighbors who helped me up.  It was difficult to form complete sentences.  I was transported by ambulance to ER.  The ER ran a battery of blood tests, CT scan and chest x-ray. The ER doctors and oncologists concluded that I must have had a delayed reaction to the vaccine. Today, April 28, things are back to normal.

A 68-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) (at the age of 68-years-old) as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and weak immune system. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. The patient underwent nasal swab COVID test on 10feb2021 with negative result, nasal swab rapid PCR COVID test on 15Feb2021 with negative result. On day one (12Mar2021), patient experienced normal tenderness at injection site, by day 3 (14Mar2021), got sick, had daughter call in LEVAQUIN 7 days worth. The patient experienced continuing chest pain from continuous coughing, BP and oxygen all over, over next 2 weeks less physical activity. On 06Apr2021, patient went to ER, had been in and out of ICU battling COVID/ pneumonia as they say. He received plasma from recovered COVID patient and Remdesivir. The patient stayed so isolated in his home; his daughter did all his shopping meds everything. Her family had been tested and was tested several times. The patient stated that he was afraid his COPD and weak immune system couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. The events required a visit to the Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic, Emergency room/department or urgent care and led to prolongation of hospitalization (as the vaccine was received during existing hospitalization (as reported)). The events were assessed by the reporter as life-threatening (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient was hospitalized for 21 days. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) on 26Feb2021, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm on 19Mar2021 , both at the age of 68 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020 or Nov2020. The patient had his first dose of BNT162B2 on 26Feb2021 and about 4 days later he had stomach pain on 02Mar2021. It lasted about 2 or 3 days then the stomach pain let up. The patient thought the stomach pain was over. Then the patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 and in about the same amount of time after receiving BNT162B2, the stomach pain came back. On Mar2021, the pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t stand up. The patient went to the doctor and he was given 4 ground up Aspirin to take. The patient screamed when the doctor pressed on one spot of his stomach. The patient was taken to the x-ray room and his stomach was x-rayed. He was asked where the pain was and when the doctor pushed on that spot, his back arched up in the air because it hurt. The x-ray showed he had a big black spot in his stomach and the doctor told him it was a blood clot. The doctor on call said it was a blood clot and his regular doctor told him it was a blood clot. The doctor&#39;s determined the blood clot was from BNT162B2 because the blood clot happened right after he received the vaccine. Besides his regular doctor who is listed in the formal field, he also saw another doctor when he went in that day with the stomach pain. He was told his regular doctor was busy and he had to see another doctor. The patient didn&#39;t have any blood drawn at the doctor just the x-ray of his stomach. The doctor said he had a blood clot, a black spot, about the size of a silver dollar in his stomach. The doctor clamped her index finger and thumb together in a circle to show him how big the black spot was. The x-ray technician and two doctors told him it was a blood clot. He had the 4 aspirin ground up and the doctor told him the aspirin got rid of the blood clot. He also took some pills for 2 to 3 days but he can&#39;t recall the name of the pills. He says the x-ray tech zeroed in on the spot that was causing him pain in his stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of blood clot cannot be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My doctor said it was &#34;possible&#34; that I went back into AFIB due to my bodies reaction to the vaccine. Up until this point in time my AFIB was being controlled by medicine after one Heart Ablation for the past two and one-half years. He changed my medicine from Flecainide Acetate to Propafenone and when that didn&#39;t revert me to normal rhythm he scheduled me for a second ablation which took place four weeks later. I was in AFIB the whole time which wasn&#39;t normal for me. 90 days after the 2nd Ablation he took me off of Propafenone. Now I&#39;m only on Eliquis for the AFIB condition. Heart is in normal rhythm.

                                                diagnosed with blood clots in the lungs; Coughing; diagnosed with pneumonia; She thinks that he had a blood clot in his leg that travelled. He was having leg pain, so he probably had a blood clot then; really, really sleeping; really bad leg pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist (patient&#39;s wife). A 68-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8729, initially reported as FR8729 then stated it is an E) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Apr2021 around 10:00 or 11:00 am (68-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included high blood pressure (also reported as family medical history), ongoing eurofibromatosis (Has had all of his life), varicose veins, overweight, rheumatoid arthritis. Concomitant medications included ongoing etanercept (ENBREL) for rheumatoid arthritis (Has been on a few years but does not remember how long exactly). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration at arm on 13Mar2021 (68-year-old at time of vaccination) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received flu vaccines in Oct2021 (67-year-old at time of vaccination). There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The wife states her husband (patient) got 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The middle of last month, he was complaining of really bad leg pain (from middle of May2021). He does have varicose veins and is on Enbrel and is overweight. He was really, really sleeping. She told him that he really needed to go see a doctor. The wife states she is in a rehab facility and is a pharmacist who worked at the hospital for over 34 years, mentions licenses in (states name). The wife stated she sent him to urgent care and they said he had varicose veins but had no problems with his leg. They did diagnose him with pneumonia. They sent him home on an antibiotic, Doxycycline 100mg, she didn&#39;t actually see the prescription, it was either for 7 or 10 days. He was down to one dose the day before yesterday. While he was at home, she heard him coughing (from 03Jun2021) and he couldn&#39;t stop coughing for about 5 minutes. She asked him when his follow up was and he told her not until Friday. She said he needed to see somebody so yesterday, he went to urgent care again. Three hours later they transferred him by ambulance to the hospital, he had blood clots in his lungs (from 03Jun2021). She is highly suspect of the Covid vaccine because he has never had problems like blood clots before. He was just admitted on the day before reporting (hospitalization for coughing and blood clots in the lungs from 03Jun2021 and ongoing). The wife is thinking maybe they misdiagnosed him approximately 10 days ago. She thinks that he had a blood clot in his leg that travelled. He was having leg pain, so he probably had a blood clot then, and they misdiagnosed him as pneumonia. The wife does not remember exact date but that it was in middle of May. His first trip to urgent care was 10 days before going to the hospital. Coughing started the same night, she asked him to go to the doctor Thursday morning and they sent him from urgent care to the hospital. He was admitted to the hospital and is still there now. Adverse events did not result in physician office visit; coughing and blood clots in the lungs resulted in emergency room visits; patient went to urgent care twice, second time was sent to emergency room via ambulance. Tests: They have been doing tests on him all day. They did an echocardiogram on the day of reporting (on 04Jun2021) and they are doing blood work on him. The wife does not know the results, she is a rehab facility a half a mile away. Treatment: They gave him some kind of shot. He doesn&#39;t give medication to himself. She has no idea, maybe something like Lovenox or something like that but she just doesn&#39;t know. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event coughing and blood clots in the lungs and included some kind of shot; therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event pneumonia and included antibiotic, Doxycycline. The outcome of the events was unknown. Causality assessment: The pharmacist (patient&#39;s wife) states she was highly suspect, as soon as they told him it was a blood clot in his lungs. Relatedness was assessed as related for all events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported serious events cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

He was delirious on 15Mar2021. When he got to Emergency Room he was in critical section, had to put on BiPAP with 100% oxygen, When in the ambulance they tested for covid and was negative each time he was tested for covid he was negative. He was in the hospital from 15Mar2021 to 24Mar2021, in critical care unit.  He Turned out having sepsis, E.coli, had to put him on strong antibiotics.

On BiPAP for a few days and then did the medium one and then able to take off oxygen when he went home. He came home on antibiotics and tons of medication. Should he get the second vaccine? Is it related? Is it to late to get the second vaccine? following Sunday he had an extremely high fever and was shaking uncontrollably on 14Mar2021. He was told to get the shot by his provider. She had to call an ambulance, he almost died, and she didn&#39;t know if it is related to her husband getting the vaccine. They put her husband on a BiPAP with 100% O2 when he went to the hospital by ambulance and was admitted on 15Mar2021, which he was on the BiPAP a couple days then went on to the second level, then right before he came home he was weaned off of oxygen.

                                                thought he was having a heart attack; It was all over his body and his left side, the pain/ left side hurts/ spread up his arm and down his hand and shoulders; left side hurts because that was where he got the shot; the first shot almost killed him, he has a defibrillator attached to his heart; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient himself). A 69-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Batch/Lot Number: ER8732) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm, on 23Mar2021 (at the age of 69 years old), as 1st dose, single, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke, weak heart, defibrillator/pacemaker insertion, impaired eyesight/ half-blind, pneumonia, headache, and ongoing prostate. The patient had a defibrillator attached to his heart, staples in his chest, and stitches. He got a weak heart from pneumonia which gave him a stroke and led to impaired sight. Patient stated everything else was working. The reason he&#39;s blind was because pneumonia hit his heart and caused a stroke along with the medication he was being given, and it happened before getting the COVID vaccine and has nothing to do with the shot. The stroke caused blindness, and they needed to add a defibrillator to his heart because the pneumonia weakened his heart even more than it was already weak. He had a defibrillator attached to his heart 14 years ago and it got took out about 7 years ago because his heart was better. He reported he had to get another defibrillator due a problem from pneumonia. The patient missed his first appointment for the first dose as he had back trouble and a headache. He called the hospital, and they listed off if you&#39;re feeling this or this don&#39;t come. The patient wasn&#39;t feeling well, so he didn&#39;t go; he did not seek medical treatment. The patient has compromising conditions; he has a defibrillator and he take blood pressure and heart medications. Every time they tested him, he was negative for COVID and he did not test positive. Concomitant medications included tamsulosin taken for prostate, start and stop date were not reported. The patient was also taking nearly 15 pills a day; 6 in morning, 2 in the afternoon/lunch, 6 at evening time and some at night before bed. He reported that he was pill popping because of his condition and he could sell and still have more than enough for himself to take, that is how bad it is for him. The patient reported about number one and number two shots of COVID vaccine. The number one shot scared him, so he was scared of getting shot number two. He didn&#39;t know what the deal of it. He received it at the hospital on 23Mar2021 (Tuesday), and it woke him up on Wednesday morning around 2 A.M (24Mar2021) and he thought he was having a heart attack. The patient wanted the second shot, but he didn&#39;t want to get it. He wanted to know whether you have to take the first shot over again or can you take the second; he heard the second shot was worse. He missed his appointment on 15Apr2021 because the first shot scared him, and he panicked. The patient stated that the first shot almost killed him, he has a defibrillator attached to his heart, and he was scared to get the second. The patient wanted to know what the deal was, if he can take second dose safely. He stated no big deal, and he&#39;s leery after the first shot woke him up. He had a pain from Wednesday morning to Sunday afternoon, stated he had a pain grade of 6-12. The patient also stated that he has been going crazy with other things, staying away from other things, with the condition he&#39;s in, he&#39;s blind, and he stayed in the house. When he went out, he was covered. The pain lasted Wednesday through Sunday, he didn&#39;t go anywhere and makes precaution to make sure not to catch something, he&#39;s always masked and always home. The patient reported that he was having pain at times when he touches his side. When he goes to bed, he sleeps on his right side with his arm across his body laying on a foam block because that side hurts. He clarified that his left side hurts because that was where he got the shot. He was surprised, the pain was so sharp, he thought he was having a heart attack. It came from his elbow, started there and spread up his arm and down his hand and shoulders. His left side hurt when he touched and pressed down, it was a pain of 12. He thought he was having a heart attack, and it scared him, that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t get the second shot. He heard the second one was worse than the first one. If the first one made him feel he was having a heart attack, the second one would surely kill him. He was worried so he decided to stay home. He felt like a kid staying home from school. The pain went away, it just scared him for how he woke up. If he had a pain grade face in the hospital, it was off the chart. He knew how he felt and how he looked, it would be off the chart. He thought in his mind he was dying, felt like he was having a heart attack, like he was dying. It took a little bit of time, he had to calm down and find where the pain was coming from, and where it was going. Pain was coming from his elbow, across his chest and hitting his defibrillator. Patient stated this was the reason he felt he was having a heart attack. The defibrillator woke him up, it had an effect on it, it woke him up and scared him. They had to put the defibrillator in because he needed it for his heart. He thought he was having a heart attack after all this, he was bugging. His son came in, and he told his son that he was in pain. His son told him not to get the shot and believed this was why the patient was hurting. His son said the vaccine and the defibrillator caused him to feel like he&#39;s having  a heart attack, the shot did something to his elbow which caused the pain and when it hit, it hit everything  and he had a pain grade of 20. It woke him up and scared him. He won&#39;t say what he wanted to say, it is personal, but it scared him that much he wanted to go there.  The patient was supposed to get his second dose 15Apr2021 because the first shot scared him, and he panicked, he did not because he was scared to death. The patient reported that everything began on Wednesday, the pain was gone, and he has recovered completely. Patient stated his pain grade was a 6-12. The pain in his elbow has recovered completely. He stated his elbow showed pain when it gets cold or rains, when it gets wet. Patient wanted to make sure if he gets the second shot, does he have to get the first shot again since he missed the second shot appointment. Everybody was saying to get the COVID vaccine, to prevent him from getting COVID, they wanted everyone to get vaccinated. He was unable to read his vaccine card because he was half-blind and will have someone else look at it. The patient missed his second dose appointment due to the effect of the first dose of the vaccine; he had a bad reaction from the number 1 shot and that was why he did not get the number 2 shot because of him being compromised due to his condition and the medications he takes. He had the first dose on 23Mar2021 and scheduled to get the second dose on 25Apr2021 (more than 21 days).  He believed the ingredients combined this caused it, when he had the event he thought that it did bother his defibrillator, he had pain that made him think he was having a heart attack. That with the meds it may have added to the pressure he received when he got the shot, where he got the shot. His left side was bothering him, he thought he had a heart attack; his defibrillator was thumping, and he had pain that hit his elbow and his defibrillator woke him up. He knew it had to do with COVID shot. It was all over his body and his left side, the pain. His heart medication and blood pressure medication were nothing different. He had pain in his side, that he does not normally have which branched out from the elbow, to the hand, to the defibrillator. His left side was sore and he could not lay on it and could not touch it since it was so painful. Patient confirmed the pain was all down the left side and he got the vaccine in his left arm. The only last effect he was having is that he was afraid to get that second shot, he was afraid to go to sleep as he won&#39;t wake up after getting the 2nd shot or how he will going to react to it. He was paranoid in his mind to get the second shot. He reported that everything was wrong with him and that the shot had to fight with his medications and his body pain for it. He reported his body is paying the price. He felt like he was having a heart attack, pain going up and down arm, his fingers felt like needles going into his hand, like life was going back through his hand. His pain went to his chest his face was nowhere on the pain chart, his pain was like a 16 on a scale of 1 to 10. When he woke up that night it was like a 20, then if he touched his arm the pain was like a 14-16. The patient could not sleep, he could not sleep on his left side. Patient had to put a foam pad on his left side he got from his friend or sleep on his right side. That started Wednesday morning at 2 A.M to Sunday morning, he was surprised when he woke up that Sunday, he was not in pain when he woke up on his back. Patient reported he was half blind and can&#39;t find his medications. He reported he put his medications down earlier and was not sure where they were.nAround that time he went to the hospital due to breathing issues, problems breathing. He went in twice and they discharged him on their own but, he had more problems breathing. What he did not know at the time he had because he did not look at the discharge paper and no one explained them to him was that he had Pneumonia when he went to the hospital. The outcome of the events vaccination site pain, heart attack was recovered on unspecified date in 2021; while for the remaining events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Two weeks to the day of my second injection (Fe. 25) I went to an ER for atrial fibrillation, the first time in my life. After I converted, I was was sent home with prescriptions for Eliquis and Metoprolol. On Sunday March 21 I went to another ER with A-Fib and was hospitalized until Tuesday. They changed the Metoprolol from succinate to tartate and did an echocardiogram.  Upon release I saw a cardiologist and began a series of tests. I don&#39;t know whether the A-Fib could be related to the vaccine but I was encouraged to report this to the CDC. Thanks.

Since taking the vaccine I have been experiencing several episodes of AFIB every day.   I  have a Kardia diagnostic  tool which confirms the AFIB episodes.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

I went to pick it up and I could not pick it up, I fell onto the bed and I could not get up. My left leg and left arm were paralyzed and I could barely speak. I could tell I could was having a stroke and I called my wife in as best I could and they called 911. They determined yes it was a stroke and they took me to the ambulance. When I was in the ambulance it went away, it only lasted about 15 minutes. I was taken to the hospital and stayed there for three days.

                                                left parietal CVA; left popliteal DVT; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number= el 1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 17:00 at single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cholesterol. Concomitant medications in two weeks included atorvastatin (LIPITOR), esomeprazole sodium (NEXIUM), triazolam and OTC vitamin. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 26Jan2021 05:30 AM, the patient experienced left parietal CVA and left popliteal DVT (hospitalization, life threatening) with outcome of recovering. The patient was hospitalized for both events for 5 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures post vaccination which included nasal swab: unknown results. Patient received TPA (Tissue plasminogen activator), blood thinners as treatment. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

Allergy consulted due to anaphylactic reaction several hours after procedure. Patient was stable on RA at time of presentation and vitals were normal and stable during the procedure from 8-9 AM. Procedure log reviewed. He received fentanyl, versed, heparin, omnipaque, and xylocaine during the procedure. No immediate reactions noted and no change in vitals during procedure. He tolerated procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac recovery room on RA with normal vitals.   At 1217, patient received percocet and at 1 PM, desaturations noted on flowsheets (84% from RA). Noted pain level of 10/10. HR increased to 130s-150s and BP did drop as low as 99/87. Per notes, he developed shortness of breath, rash, and itching with this. Given albuterol, racemic epinephrine, diphenhydramine IV, famotidine IV, and solumedrol. After developing nausea, he was given IM epinephrine at 2:10 pm. Then, symptoms rapidly improved and he was transferred to CVICU. He was shortly weaned from BIPAP (briefly hypercarbic) to nasal cannula and eventually 1-2L NC.

                                                HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 71-year-old male patient with a complex medical history with multiple problems and cancers and debilities.  He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter has memories of that, and reporter does not want that to happen again. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue: Patient did not go to church on Sunday. Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness. Reporter knew then that she had to get patient to drink water. Reporter thought that patient might be dehydrated. Patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100: A-Fib started the morning of 26Mar2021. It was resolved completely by the same evening, about supper time. After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office. Patients heart rate continued to be erratic until supper time, but it was not bad. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient had low blood pressure: Reporter checks patients blood pressure in the mornings. Patients blood pressure is now back to normal. Patients low blood pressure has resolved. It continued a bit on Saturday, 27Mar2021. It resolved on Saturday evening. Reporter is still having patient push fluids. Patient is still currently drinking a lot of fluids with electrolytes. AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. Outcome of the event atrial fibrillation, heart rate increased, Dizziness, diarrhoea was recovered on 26Mar2021, blood pressure decreased, fatigue was recovered on 27Mar2021, other events was unknown.

                                                stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist.  A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 02Apr2021 09:00 (Lot number: EP7533) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported and there were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO); empagliflozin (JARDIANCE); lisinopril all taken for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 05Mar2021 09:00 (Lot number: EN6199) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced stroke on 11Apr2021 (Stroke 7 days after injection (as reported)), it resulted in &#34;Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event) and Disability or permanent damage&#34;. The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 2 days. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and he had not been tested for COVID since the vaccination. Event outcome was not recovered.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke is likely due to an underlying medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Although temporally related, there is no sufficient evidence that the reported stroke is related to BNT162B2. Note that the patient&#39;s medical history was not reported, however, patient is taking rivaroxaban and lisinopril for unspecified indication. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He&#39;s had to have a colonoscopy just to make sure he isn&#39;t dying! He&#39;s also been diagnosed with atrial fib. Thanks for making my dad sick!

COVID-19 Unknown, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Yes, Palliative care encounter Not Applicable, Declining functional status No. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY; Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission, Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

Active Problems: Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon. Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present COVID-19. Perforated viscus. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.

A 71-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at the age of 71-year-old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was fine and nothing happened until after the vaccine. The patient took the 1st dose on 24Apr2021 and the next day he got very sick, they thought it was just a reaction from the vaccine, then he was swelling said he was not feeling well. The day after the vaccine, the patient was rushed to the emergency room and confined to the ICU. He felt unwell and it got worse and worse, we took his oxygen level and it was at 80%, he had swelling, difficulty breathing and tachycardia. The reporter thought it was an allergic reaction but this morning the patient tested positive for covid, he didn&#39;t go out the only time he went out was to get the vaccine. The reporter asked If he didn&#39;t know he had covid and got the vaccine, will he get more sick. In the report they found blood clots and the doctors thought it was from the vaccine. He was diagnosed with blood clots and difficulty breathing and he tested Covid-19 positive. Events seriousness criteria reported as hospitalization. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

The antibiotics and steroids stopped for some period. In early May they did another chest x-ray and they said it was still not clear and they restarted the antibiotics and steroids again. By that time he had already had the 2nd vaccine. In May he had some scans for his cancer and blood work. He had some Keytruda infusions between the 1st and 2nd dose of the vaccine.

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

                                                very sick/high fever/get weaker/diagnosed with double pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife).  A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL3247, intramuscular in left arm on 15Jan2021 (at 1500 or 1600) at single dose to prevent covid. There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2. There was no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The reporter stated on 16Jan2021 the patient got very very sick. He started running a fever, a high fever a high temperature all day on 16Jan2021 through 17Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night the reporter took him to the emergency room and they said it was from the covid shot. The patient began to get weaker on 17Jan2021 (not resolved) and still with a fever (resolved in Jan2021) and they said it was the shot. They went to a walk in clinic where they did a covid test on 17Jan2021 which was negative and they gave him medicine for possible pneumonia. But he didn&#39;t get any better. They went to another clinic where he had 3 more tests on 17Jan2021, &#34;a covid test, a throat culture/ strep test and a flu test that all came back negative&#34;. On 18Jan2021 his family doctor advised him to go the hospital and he was diagnosed with double pneumonia which was resolving. The reporter stated that the event required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The reporter wanted to know if he will be able to get the second shot and asking if the first dose of the covid vaccine give him pneumonia. The medicine they gave him did not seem to be doing a lot of good, he was admitted for 3 days last week (since Jan2021 to Jan2021) and he received iv antibiotics. The medicine that was not doing good she clarified was oral pills of azithromycin (Lot: KJ9712, Expiration: Jan2022. NDC: 0781808926)that was to be taken at home. The outcome of the event was not resolved.

A 72-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; batch/lot number and expiration date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

The reporter was asking if this had been reported with the vaccine. The patient was hospitalized for the event multiple pulmonary emboli on an unspecified date for 3 days. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

                                                I woke up the morning of February 16, 2021 with my heart beat racing (resting rate 130&#43; bpm&#39;s).  So I went ahead and did several readings with a Kardia device which showed AFIB, Tachycardia, and PVCs. I have those readings available upon request. The cause is likely from my second Covid 19 shot that was given to me Saturday, February 13, 2021. I cannot think of any other variables that would have caused this irregular hear beat. Since this event occurred, I have been in regular contact with my Cardiologist. My daily ekg&#39;s are showing frequent arrhythmias, mostly PVCs.  I&#39;m currently going through a series of tests to determine a course of action going forward (CT Cardiac Scoring, EKG&#39;s, Echocardiogram, etc.)

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

Tee revealed no cardiac source of embolism. He is left with some expressive and receptive aphasia. He also has some loss of L eye vision. There was no stenosis of the carotid arteries but the left M2 branch was occluded. He did not have any atrial fibrillation in the hospital but is wearing a 30 day monitor currently.   We have no idea this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report. The Neurologist thinks it is just a coincidence.  But we still want you to know it happened.

                                                Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor&#39;s meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer&#39;s reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided. The outcome was recovered on 04Feb2021 for the event &#34;sore left arm at injection site&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;shortness of breath&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;blood clot in right lung&#34;.

                                                Beginning the day after the inoculation, my husband began feeling worse in terms of his difficulty in breathing.  He used the  Albuterol inhaler more than usual.  It progressively got worse over the next 2 weeks, ending with my husband?s sudden collapse and death exactly 2 weeks later on April 5, 2021.  The inoculation may or may not have been directly linked to his unexpected death, but I feel it may have exasperated his condition, which led to his death.   And I feel it is important to report this to you.  I later heard that he should not have been using his Albuterol inhaler one week prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine.  I don?t know if that is true, but that information was never told to my husband, if it is.

Patient had just received a second Pfizer dose and had waited appropriate 15 minutes without issue.  He was then wheeling his wife in her wheelchair out to their car.  When he was halfway there he started developing a pounding sensation in his midsternal chest without radiation.  When he got in the car it was associated with significant diaphoresis.  Rapid response was called and the patient was brought to the ED immediately.  Initial EKG does show an acute lateral MI.  Patient additionally had 2 episodes of vomiting.  He denies any recent fever, chills, cough, runny nose, sore throat.  He denies any abdominal pain or urinary symptoms.  He has been compliant with his medications but his medical record states that he has a history of noncompliance.  He additionally was just seen by cardiology and was advised that everything was stable in the neck follow-up with me in 6 months.  He rates his pain as a 10 out of 10.

I had a Diabetic Dr Appointmnet at 0800 on the 8th so In went to the appointment and informed Dr that I was partially blind in my right eye. She immediately had me hospitalized and the diagnosis of a stroke was confirmed by CAT Scan and x-ray and I think a MRI. I was discharged and returned 9 days later with worsening vision and balance. I had a severe fall on discharge and hit head kept me in a extra day and actually broke a rod on a low back fusion.

He started to have intermittent intermittent fevers,  shortness of breath and labored breathing. Wife reported he would  &#34;get sweaty and hot &#34; and therefore she would give him tylenol. He saw his pcp 2 days later  on 4/7/21 for these symptoms. In addition she noticed him to present with decline in his cognition and hemibody weakness and swelling.   His pcp was also concerned about diastolic dysfunction. He received an outpatient ECHO.  He was placed on lasix and referred to cardiology. On 4/19 He saw cardiology who ordered EKG and reviewed his echo. Felt that his afib was likely contributing to his shortness of breath. His echo and recent blood work revealed preserved EF. He had occasional scattered wheezes on exam and therefore inhaler and cxr was ordered.      On 4/22 he presented to the Emergency room for breakthrough seizure.  Breakthrough seizure lasted longer than usual (20 minutes), so ED performed a CT head, which showed an age indeterminant lacunar infarct in the anterior limb of the internal capsule.

A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 16Apr2021 10:00 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot years ago, ongoing leukemia (in remission), coma, gout (he takes a gout medicine), neuropathic pain, pain, high blood pressure, thyroid (disorder), varicose veins and uses rollator (his wheelchair with a seat). Concomitant medications included metoprolol taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (THYROXINE) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; hydrocodone taken for pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; imatinib taken for leukemia in remission from an unspecified start date and ongoing; gabapentin taken for neuropathic pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; folic acid (FOLATE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and ongoing unspecified gout medicine. The patient previously took morphine; he had a shot of morphine in the emergency room sometime before his COVID vaccine. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 25Mar2021 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility was PRIVACY she thinks. Prior vaccination (4 weeks prior) were none. The patient&#39;s sister reported that they both had their second dose and she forgot to tell the other woman she spoke to about herself because the caller&#39;s focus was on her elderly brother who was 72-years-old. They both received their COVID vaccines in the morning of 16Apr2021, a Friday, and within hours her brother felt very bad. She went downstairs and saw her brother vomiting in the trash can and he just said that he hurt and that he felt nauseated. This continued for a few days, in fact it continued for 4 days. He was beginning to feel better on Monday, but he was still not up to par. Then Tuesday she guesses her brother was feeling better. On Wednesday night she went downstairs and heard him around 2300 to midnight talking to the dogs and then the next morning she found him unresponsive (22Apr2021). Her first thought was that maybe her brother had a stroke so she called 911. In the emergency room he had a CAT (computerized tomography) scan and at first they said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. But something very unusual was that her brother had a rapid heartbeat and his normal was around 60 but in the emergency room his heartrate was upwards to 120 to 130 to 140. He was then transferred to another hospital where they said the next evening that in fact he did have a stroke even though that first doctor said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. The doctor didn&#39;t find any further information until 2 days later when the doctor thought her brother already had some blood clots that were thrown into the frontal, temporal and parietal region in his brain. She was a biologist so she can&#39;t say that the COVID vaccine caused this but she thought that Pfizer should be aware of his situation and then she was so focused on her brother that she forgot to tell the other woman the really bizarre things. She had asked certain questions to the doctor based on what her sister was telling her to ask. The caller asked the doctor if her brother was going to be seen by a neurologist and the doctor gave a rambling evasive answer and then turned on his heels and walked out and kicked her out of the hospital. They both had their COVID vaccines in the morning around 1000 or so and she doesn&#39;t know if he was vomiting still the next day or not but her brother felt really bad. He has chronic conditions and he generally just felt bad and he had thought that something was wrong with him. He felt malaise, fatigue, his head hurt and he was nauseated. He ate one bowl of soup that the caller had made for him but he wasn&#39;t really eating. That lasted for about 4 days and then he started to feel better on Tuesday, confirmed to 20Apr2021, and then he felt even better on Wednesday, confirmed to 21Apr2021, because the caller did take him on some trips. He doesn&#39;t drive. Her brother said that he felt feverish and the caller says that he felt feverish to the touch as well but the thermometer said that he didn&#39;t have a fever because it had an error sign when she took his temperature. Unresponsive: Her brother was fine Wednesday night around 2300, maybe midnight, she had heard him downstairs talking to the dogs and she knew that he was okay. Then the next morning, 22Apr2021, she found him slumped into his rollator (his wheelchair with a seat) and he was slumped over and had stuff that looked like had came out of his mouth and he had vomit on legs. He was unresponsive so she called 911 and said that she thought her brother had a stroke. The operator said to lay him flat and the caller was finally able to get him up and then his arm got hung up and the operator said again to get her brother on the floor and get him flat. She understands that this was important and she was able to do it but they all fell down, her brother, her and the rollator. Shortly after this the ambulance had shown up. The ambulance took her brother to the emergency room in town and they said that her brother&#39;s heartrate was fast. She gave them all of the relevant information but she didn&#39;t think to tell them about the COVID vaccine. They said that her brother&#39;s heart was acting eradicate and it was very fast. Again, his normal heartrate is in the 60s and it was going from 110 to 140s and it wasn&#39;t coming down. She told them that when he was unresponsive that she thought he was having agonal breathing. In the emergency room, her brother&#39;s breathing was still not very good and she heard the doctor say that her brother had stopped breathing but then he came back so that&#39;s when he was intubated in the emergency room. They did a CAT scan of his head and his neck and the doctor comes back and said that her brother didn&#39;t have a stroke. But that was not the case according to a different doctor&#39;s later assessment. Approximately around 1430 to 1445 on that Thursday, 22Apr2021, they transferred him to PRIVACY,  where he was in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). His heartrate conditioned to being very fast. He went from the emergency room to the ICU. Thursday when he got transferred to the ICU they didn&#39;t do any diagnostic tests that day, he was still intubated and his heartrate was still up into the next day, Friday, 23Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t until late in the afternoon that a doctor came in and said that her brother did have a stroke he has even had prior strokes too. They had done an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) on Friday of his brain, which was not what they did in the first emergency room, that showed that he had a stroke in his temporal, frontal and parietal regions of his brain. At first caller states that on Saturday, he opened his eyes but he was still unresponsive essentially but then she says that this statement was wrong because he actually didn&#39;t respond that quickly. He has gone into a coma once before and when he had came out of it a very unpleasant thing happened that was very personal so she was not going to tell it. On Saturday and Sunday the doctor didn&#39;t want to answer the callers questions, this was a different doctor than the first ICU doctor and this one didn&#39;t have good bedside manner. Finally on Monday, 26Apr2021, her brother started responding. He was moving his legs with purpose, he had tried to kick the nurse, and he had made some words. The day before this, on Sunday the caller had brought the priest in to bless her brother and he sort of nodded and he seemed to make movements but he was still not able to talk. Monday he said what sounded like words and then Tuesday he made, what seemed to her like, meaningful statements. She was told that he had an ultrasound of his neck to see if he had any clogged arteries or veins and the nurse said that the test results came back good that their were no clogs. But this was where the whole story just becomes awful. Caller discusses how there were issues with a cousin having power of attorney from 2015 that was supposedly no longer valid according to the caller and she had spoke with administration and then she got kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday because of a question she had asked the doctor about her brother seeing a neurologist. The doctor said that the neurologist makes his own schedule and it might be 10 days or more if he even decided he wanted to see her brother. When the doctor asked the caller how would she like her brother&#39;s care to be she mentioned that he was in a coma before and was being treated for similar circumstances from PRIVACY and that he was seen by a neurologist and she said that maybe her brother should be seen by PRIVACY and the doctor walked out and within minutes she was being escorted out of the hospital for belittling the doctor and calling administration. Now they won&#39;t even let flowers be delivered to her brother. Unfortunately the person who has been involved with him the most, the caller, was now barred from him. She was not saying that this was all due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why were they saying that she has a blood clot too. She has had headaches but they may be due to stress. She didn&#39;t feel sick like her brother. She has a question and she was really scared about the answer. She was just now reading that if you&#39;re on immunosuppressant drugs then you&#39;re not supposed to have the COVID vaccine. She asked was that true. Well her brother was in remission for leukemia and he was on a cancer medication called imatinib. Caller declined to speak to medical information about this and says it was already too late because he was already taking it and she doesn&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t stop them. Her brother&#39;s friends have tried to call and they were all getting the same statement, which she believes the hospital was stone walling, but the hospital says that they don&#39;t have a patient by his name and they have even told the florist the same thing. So caller was unsure if her brother has been discharged or not. He didn&#39;t seem to be in the shape to be shipped to a care facility but she doesn&#39;t know. It was hard for her to piece it all together. The hospital wasn&#39;t feeding her brother enough before she left so for all she knows they could be starving him to death and holding nutrition from him. History/ Investigations: His medications were ones that he has been taking for years and she doesn&#39;t know exact start dates for any and if she needs to she can get the dosage information from the pharmacy. Her brother has hid his pills before and he puts them in different bottles, it was a nightmare. He takes a gout medicine and she doesn&#39;t know the name of it. Those were the main ones that he takes other than the cancer medicine she said earlier. And he also takes gabapentin for some of his neuropathic pain and he takes something at night and a few others she thinks. For medical conditions the only thing that she knows was that many years ago he had a blood clot but she can&#39;t really say what year it was. She does know that her brother wasn&#39;t on any blood thinners to he knowledge and not long ago he had an ultrasound of his legs to determine if he had a blood clot but she was not 100 % sure if he had that but she thinks he did. Her brother told her that years ago he had blood clots that were due to weight lifting causing varicose veins and later they collateralized and they found out that the other secondary vessels took over for pumping his blood so it wasn&#39;t a problem. Her concern was can someone from Pfizer talk to her about what&#39;s going on with her brother, she knows Pfizer doesn&#39;t have his records but how will Pfizer be able to determine if this was from the COVID vaccine. She guesses that she was curious about what may of caused the blood clots. She mentioned the COVID vaccine to one doctor and he didn&#39;t seem like she respected her knowledge. She asked was there anything that can be done to help her brother if it was a blood clot. She was upset that the hospital and her wanting her brother to see a neurologist and beginning with a claim that he didn&#39;t have a stroke and then a claim that he did. She thinks that they were not doing enough for her brother and they were just saying oh well, it was all due to a fast heart rate which can happen as a result of the COVID vaccine. She was going to be honest, she was exhausted and she can&#39;t keep talking for a long time. She asked if she can call medical information back later when she was more refreshed. Consumer further stated that her brother had complaints of feeling ill, feverish and having no appetite. Caller stated that the next Thursday she found her brother unconscious, heart rate was elevated 120 to140 beats per minute and that her brother had a stroke. The outcome was recovered on 21Apr2021 for the events Malaise, Nauseated, Fatigue, Headache and Appetite absent; recovering for the event Vomiting; and unknown for the rest of the events.  Information on lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                He received his vaccine, he had a slightly sore arm.  A couple days after the vaccine he was lying in bed and he started out one sentence in jibberish.  He realized that he had done that, paused and apologized to his wife and it happened again in jibberish and he stopped again and he looked at his wife and said &#34;that&#39;s not good&#34;.  He then found out that the entire time that he was speaking that way, and was aware that he was not making any sense.  The next day he noticed that he was dragging his right foot when he tried to walk.  He made an APT to his doctor and she said that he had a TIA, but the effects had cleared.   The doctor told him to call the cardiologist office and to get an appointment with them, and he saw a cardiologist.  The cardiologist said that he wants him to loose weight and gave him a prescription for Plavix which he is taking.  Ever since he moved to Arizona he has had spontaneous nosebleeds, and have been getting worse every year since being there.  In 2020 they have been the worst that he has had.  He has had nasal cautery twice.  A week after being on the Plavix he had another bleed, and he was advised to stop taking his 81 mg aspirin.  Then a week later still on Plavix he had another nosebleed and this bleed was so bad that he ended up going to UC, and it stopped by the time he got there, and lasted for more than an hour.  He called his cardiologist and his PCP and told them that he was not taking anymore Plavix until the nosebleeds stopped.  He has since then talked to his ENT and told him that the cauterization is not working and is having the nosebleeds of his life.  He suggested that he have surgery for his deviated septum, and has to have clearance from your PCP or cardiologist to have that surgery.   In the past 5 days he has had 3 nosebleeds.  His cardiologist scheduled him a stress test, and also a carotid ultrasound, as well as a CAT scan of his brain and echocardiogram.

                                                pulmonary embolus; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.  A 72-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscular on 13Apr2021 (at the age of 72-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EP7533) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included coronary artery disease (CAD), diastolic congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), morbid obesity and hyperlipidaemia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified, the patient experienced pulmonary embolus. The event required Emergency Room/department or urgent care visit and the patient was hospitalized for 2 days. Corrective treatments taken as a result of the event included anticoagulation. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19; since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was recovering from the event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information and known product profile, the causal relationship between the reported pulmonary embolism  and the use of BNT162B2 cannot be fully excluded.  The patient&#39;s underlying condition may also contribute to the risk for the reported event. As there is limited information available to further assess the case, the case will be assessed further upon receipt of new information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A few hours after 2nd covid injection, along with  mild myalgias/prodromal sx., I went into atrial fib., with mild tach. but no other problems.  The arrythmia persisted for ~24 hr.s then converted back to sinus rhythm-- and fine since.  This event is more of an interesting observation than an &#34;adverse event&#34; but as the spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors, I thought the two events might be related and possibly of interest to you.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

A 73-year-old male patient (husband) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9810), intramuscularly administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 at age of 73 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial flutter, cardiac ablation from Jan2020, tooth infection, root canal, ongoing prostate issues. Concomitant medication included tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) taken for prostate issues from an unspecified start date and ongoing, medication for nasal congestion (He had a lot of sinus issues. It was mainly nasal sprays that he used). The patient previously took penicillin BK for tooth infection, clindamycin for tooth infection, amoxicillin for tooth infection, paracetamol (TYLENOL) for pain. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation on 16Feb2021. This case was a serious report with Seriousness criteria-Caused/prolonged hospitalization. Reporter said that her husband got the first dose of the vaccine on 06Feb2021 and on 15Feb2021 he went to the cardiologist. She said that he had a history of atrial flutter and had an ablation over a year ago in Jan2020. She said that he went in for a routine check. She said that he had been off of his cardiac medications because he was doing fine after the ablation. The doctor told him to follow up in a year. On 16Feb2021, he started having weird things going on with his heart. He took some medication to help the rate of his heart. Reporter clarified that he took Metoprolol (TOPROL XL) 50mg that he had in the house. The doctor told him to take it in case something happened. She said that there was the chance that he had Afib and was just asymptomatic. They never saw any evidence of Afib previously though, just AFlutter. He had no episodes of Afib. She said that previously he went off of his medications and was doing ok. They were told to buy a watch that monitors his heart rate. Reporter said that when she checked his heart rate on the pulse ox it was 180. She called an ambulance and he was admitted to the hospital for atrial fibrillation. She said that they had to do a cardioversion in the ambulance on the way there and it was a significant occurrence. Her husband experienced Afib about 10 days later after the vaccine, was cardioverted on the way to the hospital and was hospitalized due to atrial flutter. Reporter stated doctor told them they didn&#39;t see any correlation with the vaccine. Reporter wanted to know if these symptoms were reported before. She said that during this period of time, he had been on 3 different antibiotics for a tooth infection and had a root canal. She said that he took these from the beginning of Jan2021 for about a week each. She said that his tooth infection was not any better or was worse and they would try another antibiotic. Reporter clarified that the antibiotics were Penicillin BK first, then he was on Clindamycin the second time, then was on Amoxicillin the 3rd time. He was also on Tylenol 3 for the pain during this as well.  The patient took 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EM6198) intramuscularly in the Left arm on 01Mar2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

                                                My uncle died three days after taking the vaccine; he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat; he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting for her uncle.    A 73-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included psoriasis , cardiac pacemaker insertion on an unknown date (He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago) , hypertension from an unknown date.      The patient  died three days after taking the vaccine  on 09Apr2021 , he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 150/90   on  09Apr2021.    It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Course of the event: The reporter&#39;s uncle died three days after taking the vaccine. He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature. He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago and has a history of psoriasis and HTN. There is additional concomitant medical history I will have to confirm.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment for the reported patient&#39;s sudden death. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 14Feb2021 at 15:45 (Lot Number: EL3247) (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, family history, or concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: E10142 (as reported)), in the right arm, on 24Jan2021 at 15:45 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung in Feb2021, which required hospitalization from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated he did not know what date the blood clots occurred and can&#39;t tell when that happened, but it was maybe a few weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. He stated that one blood clot is in the right leg near the calves and the blood clot broke and split some and went up into the side of his lung as it was detected in a doppler on 27Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The doppler was performed as soon as he went into the emergency room and they went through a series of tests with unknown results on 27Feb2021 and 28Feb2021. The patient stated that the right leg is bigger than the other leg and they told him it might stay that size and may not go down. The patient is now on apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg for the rest of his life. In the beginning, they gave him an unspecified shot in his stomach, then after that he began taking apixaban at two pills in the morning and two pills at night, then they cut him down to 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening, and he started it right when he went into the hospital immediately. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung was unknown.

                                                In mid March, I was very physically active and had no physical limitations. I had no underlying conditions except for a slightly elevated homocysteine level diagnosed a year prior. I have never smoked in my life or has any prior lung issues. After the two doses I developed difficulty in breathing, shortness of breath in any minor activity, which began about two weeks after the second dose, and pains in my right side.

He spoke with his PCP and was told to quarantine and report any worsening symptoms. Wednesday or Thursday he began with vomiting and unable to hold down any fluids. His cough was nonproductive. On Saturday 4/17/21 he reported to Hospital ER with SOB, cough, vomiting &amp; diarrhea. He was diagnosed with COVID PNA. He passed away 5/7/21 of COVID PNA, respiratory failure. He tested positive the week of 5/7/21 again of COVID 19. I feel this needs to be reported as he had both PFIZER vaccines in January &amp; February and still ended up intubated and deceased from COVID 19.

This 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 73-year-old) (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200) as single dose (unknown if first or second dose) for COVID-19 immunisation and bendamustine from an unspecified date, 5th dose in what was to be a series of 12, for Waldenstrom&#39;s macroglobulinaemia. Relevant medical history included Waldenstrom&#39;s macroglobulinaemia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took bendamustine for Waldenstrom&#39;s macroglobulinaemia (the patient received 12 doses over 6 months 2 years ago). On 03Mar2021, the patient experienced severe anaphylactic shock and loss of consciousness; the events were considered serious as life-threatening. The patient specified that 5 days after the vaccine, the patient was undergoing chemotherapy with bendamustine. He had Waldenstrom&#39;s macroglobulenemia. This was his 5th dose in what was to be a series of 12. He had received 12 doses over 6 months 2 years prior to this report. During the treatment, the patient went into severe anaphylactic shock. He was unconscious in about 10 seconds from the onset of his first symptoms. He was treated on site and transferred to an E.R.  The severity of the event and the fact that both drugs were playing around with his immunoglobulins led him to file this report. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient underwent a nasal swab on an unspecified date which was negative. He recovered from the events on an unspecified date.

                                                shortness of breath, chest xray with pulmonary edema, periorbital edema Narrative:  73 yo M w/ PMH HTN, HLD, EVAR (2013) for AAA c/b persistent type II endoleak s/p multilple repairs (2015 &amp; 2017) c/b glue embolization down into the R CIA secured with additional stent placement with the R iliac limb, s/p b/l Iliac artery aneurysm stent 08/31/20, and PTSD. Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office.

                                                My father complained of heartburn the evening he received his vaccine.  He told my mother he need to sit  down and relax.  My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

He was off pressors but remained intubated due to poor mental status with unclear etiology. It could be related to liver failure, vs neurological insult vs renal failure. Head CT 4 days prior on the 2/24 were without acute intracranial pathology. Hepatology was consulted and did not believe the liver was the main etiology behind poor mental status. Patient progressively declined with continuously increased IV pressor requirement. ABG showed worsening lactate acidosis and was anuric. Patient&#39;s family was notified of decline and agreed for the patient to be transition to comfort care early 2/28. Bedside RN notified pronouncing physician of cessation of respiration and cardiac activity.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9262) on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 74years) for Covid-19 immunization and stated no reactions. Medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes but are all currently under control and feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered. It was reported that in the past the doctors thought he experienced TIA (transient ischemic attack) but wasn&#39;t sure if that was accurate. Concomitant medications included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL), trazodone (TRAZODONE), insulin (INSULIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and prednisone (PREDNISONE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that on 19Feb2021 the patient received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and stated he remember feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered earlier. On Sunday 21Feb2021, the reporter (patient&#39;s wife) began noticing that the patient was showing symptoms of a stroke. The patient&#39;s one leg was rapidly kicking, and his speech began to slur. The patient was then rushed to ER (emergency room) and hospitalized. At the hospital it was confirmed that the patient was having a stroke. The patient recovered and was doing rehab for his leg. Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

Unclear whether or not he suffered chronic migraines, although there was paperwork at the death scene stating that he had an appointment for a MRI on 3/1/21.  No recent influenza-like symptoms are reported.  He was found dead in his home on 2/22/21, seated at a chair at his desk.    Autopsy findings include an enlarged and dilated heart, granular kidneys, with the right kidney very shrunken and about half the size of the left kidney, and prostate hypertrophy.  There is no trauma.  The airway is not edematous.    Ancillary studies that are pending include microscopy, toxicology (basic testing plus vitreous chemistries), a COVID swab, a respiratory viral panel swab, HIV testing, and neuropathology.  The cause and manner of death on the death certificate will both be ?pending further studies? until these studies are completed.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Two massive bilateral clots; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable physician (patient). A 75 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 74 years old, administered in arm left on 23Feb2021 (Lot Number: EL9204) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), history of cancers. No known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient had received other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 74 years old, administered in arm left on 02Feb2021 (Lot Number: EN6200) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced pulmonary embolism on 19Apr2021, two massive bilateral clots on 19Apr2021. Events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), Disability or permanent damage. The patient was hospitalized for all events for 6 days. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal swab: negative on 03Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism, two massive bilateral clots and included Heparin and Xarelta. The outcome of the events was recovered with Seroquel in 2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relation, the association between pulmonary embolism, thrombosis and vaccination with BNT162B2 cannot be completely ruled out. The contribution of patient&#39;s age cannot be completely ruled out in the occurrence of the events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was in AFib (atrial fibrillation) 3 years ago and was treated with an ablation - 7/16/2018.  Afterwards I would occasionally feel an irregular heart beat. I had my first Covid 19 vaccination on 01/15/2021 - Pfizer-BioNTech - lot # EL1284 My second Covid 19 vaccination was on 02/05/2021 On about 02/19/2021 and many times after I was feeling an irregular heart beat. My doctor says I am in AFib again and I am scheduled for another ablation in July, 2021. Is it possible that the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid 19 vaccination caused the current AFib (my doctor thought so) or is it a coincidence ?

This consumer (wife) reported for a 75-year-old male patient that received his first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), on 31Jan2021 (at the age of 75-years-old) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dialysis for approximately 2.5 years, a lung problem, blood pressure. Concomitant medications included carvedilol and warfarin and other unspecified medications.  The patient experienced pneumonia and died on 11Feb2021 03:00 AM. An autopsy was not performed. The cause of death was reported to be  pneumonia. Clinical course was the follows the next day on 01Feb2021 at 9:30AM the patient was dressed and ready to go to dialysis. His oxygen dropped too low to 76. He wanted an ambulance called. He went into the hospital. The patient was confused, and he was not normally confused. In the hospital the physicians said he had pneumonia, but it wasn&#39;t that bad. The doctors were baffled. He also was in the hospital for something with toxins. He had a lung problem for a long time. If he didn&#39;t go to the bathroom the toxins were hitting the liver and then the toxins were going to the brain. When he was in the hospital he couldn&#39;t eat or swallow. The first day he did eat a bit, but he had dialysis in the hospital, and it knocks him out. They were giving him antibiotics IV. He couldn&#39;t swallow any of his pills. He was in there for 11 days and had not eaten. He couldn&#39;t swallow any pills. He started going to sleep and they started giving him Morphine drip at the end. They couldn&#39;t get any medicine in him because he couldn&#39;t swallow. The patient died of pneumonia, the outcome of the other adverse events was unknown.

I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.

Subsequently developed rash 1 week later and was biopsied by Derm subsequently developed cellulitis of bx site and was given keflex. Then developed mouth ulcers/?thrush thought to possibly be Keflex side effect. Had fevers and chills week of 3/19, also body aches, anorexia, and malaise, on 4/13 he presented to ER with bilateral PE, Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Cold agglutinin disease) and eosinophilia and skin rash resembling livido reticularuis. He was initially reported to be thrombocytopenic with platelet down to 77 but with lots of clumping. Platelet manual count reveled platelet normal at 160, however it was done after patient received IVIG and prednisone. HIT serology came back strongly positive at 2.58 however equivocal (does not neutralize heparin), patient was then switched to Xarelto.

                                                Patient was a healthy 75 year old male when he got the shot.  Within  5 hours, he began to feel TIRED, which was an expected side effect. He felt tired for several days. Nine days later he went to Memorial Hermann ER in Kingwood, and they said he had pneumonia. They also said he had a &#34;small mass&#34; at the bottom of his lung and might want to get it checked out. On March 20, he developed a cough. On March 21 we went to a different ER and a CT scan showed he had plureal effusion.  On the next day he was short winded. He went back to the ER and they admitted him and transferred him to hospital by ambulance.  On March 23, 1.7 liters of fluid was drained from his lung and sent to be tested. On March 26 he was diagnosed with malignant plureal effusion. He passed out at the doctor office and tranferred to to another facility by ambulance. He remained there for 4 days for tests, and a port was put in to drain the fluid. On March 29 he was transferred .  They repeated many tests and did a bronchoscopy.  On April 1 they told him he had squamous cell carcinoma.  He came home on April 2. The doctor called and said they made a mistake he had small cell carcinoma.  He remained home until April 11, when he was taken back to  by ambulance.  He had gone from a healthy appearing individual on March 17 to a critically ill individual and he died on April 15.  Doctors had never seen cancer overtake a man in 28 days. 28 days!!!!  On March 22, he had a small mass at the bottom of his lung, and one week later, it was a mass so large, his lung could not be seen and his lung had collapsed.  Doctors assumed that the cancer was dormant and that the vaccine did something to wake it. It attacked my husband with a vengeance.  He never smoked.

He gets routine cancer check ups every 6 months, on 5/19/21 he had his usual CT scan of his chest, which showed a new pleural effusion and a new pericardial effusion.  Then there was a growth between his pericardial fat 2 cm x 2 cm that is not cancer as he had a PET scan afterwards that was negative for any highlighted areas.  His Houndsfield Units for the mass was 6.2 cm is 35-36 HU.  He then saw his results online and they want to do biopsies to see what is in the growth and in the effusion.    They have not figured out what to do yet for these symptoms. so he is going to be undergoing additional testing.    He did not have any of these symptoms or problems on his previous 6 month check up and is concerned that it is due to the vaccine itself.  He is in good health and exercises on a continual basis, does not smoke and never had, but does have a couple of drinks a day, but nothing to excess.
