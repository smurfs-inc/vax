                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

A 61 year old male patient received first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) at the age of 60 years old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 10Mar2021 (Lot Number: EL6205) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure, mouth started to feel numb and allergies to tree pollen; and family history of diabetic and heart disease (father); all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included losartan potassium (TEMISARTAN), gabapentin, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), furosemide, potassium, valproate semisodium (DIVALPROEX) and tizanidine; all taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2. The next day, he said his mouth started to feel numb, and he had a loss of taste. Then on Saturday, his eyes started to tear a lot, and the right side of his face started drooping like that of a stroke. He also said he had headache on the back of his head, and his eyes do not. The patient wanted to know if he should go to the emergency room or if this is a normal reaction to the vaccine. The patient did have a sensation starting on Thursday of numbness in his mouth. The patient describes it as a feeling like when he was younger and would use chloraseptic spray, it feels like same numbness. He states that on Saturday his eyes started tearing up, and he does have allergies to tree pollen. The right side of his face feels and looks like he had a stroke, it is droopy on right side. The patient can&#39;t pronounce words right, can&#39;t smile, and can&#39;t close his right eye. The patient was checked with heart rate and EKG with his little machine and his temperature, and they all seem fine. The patient was also getting headaches at the back of his head. The patient took Advil for headaches, but it is not improving. The patient ran out of the Advil and doesn&#39;t have the bottle anymore. The patient took allergy pills, a knock off Benadryl, because he thought his eye tearing was possibly from allergies to tree pollen allergy or possible allergic reaction to the drug. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: fine, CAT: not reported, EKG: fine, complete blood work: not reported and heart rate: fine; all on 15Mar2021. The outcome of loss of taste was unknown. The outcome of the rest of the events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

The exact date of the vaccine is unknown. His girlfriend told me he got his second Vaccine at the end of February. I also don&#39;t know what vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) he got, so the Pfizer is just a guess. Patient started feeling bad and looking bad after his second vaccine. He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 61-years of age), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 17Mar2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago (2005), and had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine (Dec2020). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took ANCEF [cefazolin sodium] and had allergies; and oxacillin which the patient had allergies and hepatitis. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination nor was he tested for covid since vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to Covid vaccine.  It was reported that the day the patient received the first vaccine his calf, foot, and knee swelled up by evening. It stayed swollen for a week and he went to see his doctor. He did an ultrasound on his calf and found a deep blood clot. He was now on blood thinners. He mentioned that he had a knee replacement 3 months before the vaccine but it was progressing fine. Usually blood clots occur after surgery within a 2 week period. He had a blood clot after a back fusion about 16 years ago.

A 62-year-old male patient started to receive single dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection, batch/lot number and exp date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization; and adalimumab (HUMIRA), via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unspecified dose (injection every other month) for arthritis. Medical history included arthritis, blood pressure (abnormal), and blood cholesterol (abnormal). Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, olmesartan medoxomil, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL XL), and vitamins: ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride. Patient stated, &#34;The reason I am calling, I have just a concern that something happened to me. I did not pay much attention but now I have read the news one doctor died after getting this COVID Vaccine (Further details were not available over the call) I have a small incident happened to me the day after I received my first dose of the COVID Vaccine. I just wanted to get some information. You know what happened the next day night, in the evening I was taking a shower and all of sudden I was bleeding from somewhere. Lot of blood was coming out while I was toweling my body out. I couldn&#39;t find out where the blood is coming from. I checked, it&#39;s not from my urine, not from my rectum but it was quite a lot of blood drawing out of my body. Immediately, I called my wife into bathroom, then I squeezed my body then the bleeding stops. It was on 24Dec2020. You know my kids were at home. I don&#39;t want them to find it. The bleeding stopped and everything went away. Then I thought maybe it is something related to my GI. I went to my GI doctor yesterday to have a checkup, they don&#39;t know anything either but I am due for my second dose for next week Wednesday. Now I had this news about thrombocytopenia on this doctor died (Clarification unknown). So I am just afraid if there is anything related this. Do you have any explanation on how I bleed and where it bleed? It was lot of bleeding even my towel was full of blood.&#34; Patient wanted to see if anybody else had similar experience or if he get the second dose and he get the complication again. Patient was a medical technologist. He was doing ultrasounds. He was working in a pediatric hospital. Patient was not prescribed/recommended vaccination. &#34;Nobody recommended it. During my hospital. I am healthcare professional. So everybody in my hospital. I just went there and get it. I didn&#39;t ask my doctor.&#34; Patient added, &#34;You know everything I read about this case and then you know, I have a cut in my leg which is very unusual. I have never seen that. I don&#39;t know how it happened. You know all of sudden oneday I wake up and I saw a big cut in my feet also. So, I am just afraid (onset date not reported).&#34; The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about Lot/Batch number is requested.

                                                The recipient was feeling well immediately after the vaccination,  all day on 2.8 and in the morning of 2.9.  His daughter in law text him at 0930 and he did not respond to the text (atypical) and then he missed a morning meeting.  His wife was downstairs in a meeting herself and after the meeting was over she called to him and he did not respond.  She found him with no pulse and was not breathing.  She called 911 and attempted CPR.  They did not complete an autopsy, they stated that they believe the cause of death was either an embolism, Heart attack or aneurism.   The wife stated that she does not believe the death was due to the vaccination; however, there were no tests completed to prove or disprove.

He then lost consciousness and slumped in his chair.   Medical staff was notified and he was still unresponsive.  He was lowered to the floor and upon assessment, he had no pulse or respirations.  CPR was begun with bag mouth ventilation and subsequently chest compressions.  He received 50mg of IM Benadryl and 40mg of Solu Medrol IM.  He still had no pulse and he an AED pads were applied.  AED analysis indicated a shockable rhythm and one shock was administered with return of pulse.  He remained unconscious and ventilation was continued until EMS arrived.

                                                Within 1 minute of vaccine being injected. I started to feel dizzy. I was wheeled in wheelchair to observation area. I kept feeling more dizzy and started to feel tingly in my fingers and legs (both sides equally) After 15 minute observation time was over, I tried to stand up and immediately sat down again as a wave of dizziness  hit me. Doctor in observation area saw me and came over. I told him how I felt. He put his fingers to my wrist and felt my pulse. It was initially between 40 and 90, then steadied off around 90-100. He called for EMTs on duty to come over with a stretcher because he thought I should be laid flat. The EMT took my blood pressure and it was 155/94. The doctor said at one point my pulse was thready. By this point the dizziness was stronger and I felt tingly in my teeth as well as other areas. I was asked about my breathing and I said that it was okay. An ambulance was called for and arrived. I don&#39;t remember the exact time. The moved me from the wheelchair to a stretcher. I could not stand up on my own and lurched toward the stretcher. I am grateful strong people were there to get me on stretcher and strapped in. All throughout this my normally barely noticeable Atrial Fibrillation was quite apparent and more erratic. This was a major reason for ambulance call. Some of the stroke protocol was done including gripping EMT&#39;s fingers equally and following his finger with my eyes. I was very cold throughout. I was brought to the waiting ambulance outside and driven to Medical Center. The EMT took an EKG which showed atrial fibrillation and a line was put into my arm.  When we got to the hospital, I was brought into the triage area and had all my vitals taken. Blood pressure was high, so was pulse then for a half hour, I was very hot and sweated a lot after being cold.

A 62-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 10Mar2021 14:30 (at the age of 62-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine facility type was a pharmacy or drug store. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. Medical history included macular. Concomitant medication included amitriptyline. The patient previously took erythromycin and statins and experienced drug allergies from these. The reported adverse events were superficial blood clot on left calf at the lower end of some varicose veins two days after injection (on 12Mar2021 at 10:00). It may be unrelated, but the patient wanted to let know. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. AE treatment included hot compress, support stockings and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Varicose veins most probably was a preexisting condition, unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine. The reported superficial blood clots are considered a complication of varicose vein and unlikely related to BNT162B2.

                                                Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; Recurrence of Atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  A 63-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 25Jan2021 13:00 at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hyperlipidemia, GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), and atrial fibrillation, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had prior ablations for Afib. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. On 04Jan2021, 18:00, the patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications included dofetilide, diltiazem, loratadine, rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), and omeprazole (OMEPRA); the patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 28Jan2021 02:00, the patient experienced recurrence of atrial fibrillation after 6 months, the last episode was within a month after an ablation. No treatment was received in response tot eh event. Outcome of the event was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported recurrence of atrial fibrillation was more likely due to natural recurrence of underlying atrial fibrillation, and unlikely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

In fact I came out of A-Fib immediately after the first dose of the vaccine on February 15, 2021.  After the second dose of the vaccine at 10:00 A.M. on March 8th I went into A-Fib at approximately 2:00 A.M. on March 9th. I was out of A-Fib and back into a normal sinus rhythm at approximately 2:00 P.M. on March 9th.

                                                Pt developed left facial numbness and sensation of heat and numbness in the left arm and numbness into the leg and foot. Symptoms started at 1:36 pm while walking to catch train. Pt noted numbness and felt light headed. Pt had mild headache that he associated with not eating much. Pt returned back to urgent care because of symptoms and RR team called.    Pt had given blood for tests (12 vials) and abdominal ultrasound earlier in the morning as work up for his chronic renal insufficiency. Pt drank several cups of water before the ultrasound.  Symptoms initially improved but did not resolve, so he was sent to ER for stroke. Pt had 3 more episodes of worsening left sided numbness and lost consciousness on 2 of those occasions per the patient. Neurology evaluated patient and said that they were likely thalamic strokes. Pt was unable to have an MRI because of metal in his eye.

He initially developed left arm numbness and tingling which prompted admission to ER.   Later that same day, he had significant worsening with left hemiparesis.    MRI demonstrated right hemispheric ischemic stroke and focal right carotid ruptured plaque.    Somewhat unusual given his overall good health and lack of risk factors.    Has never smoked, exercises regularly and carotid duplex performed in 2017 demonstrated less than 50% right internal carotid artery stenosis.   Takes aspirin daily.     Currently remains hospitalized with significant left upper extremity paresis.  Minimal left leg function.  Did require carotid endarterectomy.  The plaque rupture was focal and hemorrhagic with no significant evidence atherosclerotic plaque beyond the focal ruptured plaque.

Due to sudden drop in hemoglobin patient&#39;s heparin drip was suspended since 4/12.  Mixing studies showed partial correction consistent with acquired factor inhibitor.  Factor VIII levels less than 1 consistent with factor VIII inhibitor. Patient was started on FEIBA at 100 units/kg every 12 hours, tolerated very well,  In order to eliminate the inhibitor immunosuppressive therapy was initiated: Will continue Solu-Medrol 80 mg daily and Cytoxan 2 mg/kg daily.

The patient had pneumonia shot and flu shot took that in Sep2020. The was no vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2.The patient previously received Xanax for anxiety from unknown date to 2012; received Humalog , Glipizide and Metformin for Diabetes. The patient got his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot on Monday 15Mar2021 at sometime between 15:30-16:00. Not even an hour after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine shot his arm started hurting real bad, felt like a hot ice pick was in his arm-described as it started locally just in one spot, then started getting worse going down to his elbow. About 30-45 minutes after got out of there, he was sick, didn&#39;t know what was wrong with him. Also reported as by 16:30 he felt bad and pulled up to a friends house. He would say it was an allergic reaction; starting in his arm, a severe pain that radiated down to elbow, arm, chest, it was hard to breathe since 18Mar2021. He went to a friends house after getting the shot, and by the time he got to the friend&#39;s house, he felt sick and laid down for about two hours and just kept feeling worse and worse. After that he went home and went to bed. He stayed in bed Tuesday, 16Mar2021, Wednesday, 17Mar2021 and was able to drag himself out of bed to at least go to the bathroom on Thursday morning, 18Mar2021. When he got out of bed, he couldn&#39;t breathe. When he got up Thursday morning he couldn&#39;t even move his whole left side, had to grab nightstand and pull himself up to stand up out of the bed; stumbled to the bathroom about 3 feet away.He made his way to the phone and called his sister to tell her to call an ambulance because he couldn&#39;t breathe. When he got to the emergency room he was told he was in atrial fibrillation. He stayed in the hospital with primary diagnosis as multifocal pneumonia with atrial fibrillation. Feeling like heart beating out of his chest, machine going off every 2-3 minutes. It took about 9-10 hours to get the atrial fibrillation under control. He stayed in Hospital for 4 days-admitted 18Mar2021-discharged 22Mar2021. He spoke to his heart doctor who said it was hard to breathe due to the Atrial fibrillation and all his doctors say they did not know whether it was a reaction to the covid vaccine.He heard the doctors talking and they were saying they didn&#39;t think he was going to make it. His heart rate was going between 80 and 200. He had 3 different IV&#39;s going in each arm shooting different heart medications in him and the doctor explained that the medications didn&#39;t mix well, could not go in the same IV at the same time. The patient shared that this was the second worst feeling he has ever had since he had his first heart surgery. He meant they thought he was dead or dying he lost feeling of everything. His arm felt better, but every now and again felt like a little knot or something was in there. He was breathing better, they gave him inhalers, albuterol. He thought that his heart doctor was going to start him on oxygen. He went to his Cardiologist on 01Mar2021 on Monday, 2 weeks before getting his first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: cardiologist told him his triglycerides raised up about 15 was about 268. All his Cardiologist did was change his blood pressure medicine. Went to his Endocrinologist on 08Mar2021 Monday, 1 week before he took the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine: Endocrinologist raised his Lantus SoloStar U-100 insulin 100 units/mL (3mL) from 60 units nightly to 64 units nightly then. All his other blood tests were good, they just said keep doing what you&#39;re doing.The outcome of all the events was resolving.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: unknown results on Oct2020.  On 13Apr2021 He reported it to the doctor and he told the patient to skip a dose of Lisinopril that sometimes it can have those symptoms of a deep nonproductive cough. He skipped the medication, and it hasn&#39;t gotten better. He thinks it is from the COVID vaccine.  At the peak of his cough, he probably had 6 days where he coughed uncontrollably for 24 hours in a day.  He still has a cough.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pneumonia. The doctor didn&#39;t do a chest X-ray or COVID test.

This 63-year-old male patient reported that he received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6206) on 17Mar2021 (at the age of 63-years-old) via unspecified route as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included enlarged prostate, urinary health issues (gets up in the middle of the night), has glasses as he had cataract surgery last year (2020) so he lost his close-up vision. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3249) on 18Feb2021 (also reported as 17Feb2021) (at the age of 63-years-old) via unspecified route as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced urinating blood and blood clots profusely, UTI, bleeding, arm pain, and fatigue. The patient received his second shot on 17Mar2021 and almost to the date three weeks later, had the same incident with urinating blood and passing blood clots. He waited an extra day because he could not go to the bathroom and then he went to the ER that same day so that they could flush him out. He also had an appointment on that same day with his urologist. A CT scan was done at the ER and then in the afternoon he went to the doctor. The doctor did a catheter flush. The patient was unclogged but he was passing blood. The patient also reported that he did have the normal arm pain and fatigue the second day or the day after the shot. He has no other adverse reactions at this time. The patient reported 11Apr2021 or 12Apr2021 was when he started bleeding from the second one (shot). He went to the hospital on 14Apr2021. The patient confirmed he was not admitted. The patient reported he is going to the doctor today (21Apr2021) to see the urologist but the urologist is going to do a scope in his bladder because that is the only thing that they cannot see. The clinical outcome of the events urinating blood, blood clots, bleeding, arm pain, and fatigue was unknown. The patient stated he does not know if this is an issue, however, it coincided with both of his shots. The patient was calling to see if this is something that has been seen or if it is in his head.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021470922 same  patient/reporter, different AE/first dose

The patient stated the amount of blood and blood clots was scary at best. The patient reached out to his daughter who is a nurse who advised him to go to the Emergency Room (ER). He reached out to the nurse hotline as well, which recommended that he go to the emergency room that day as well. He went to the ER (it was a Sunday). They did a blood test, a sonogram or some kind of sonogram, and a urine sample. They also flushed the patient&#39;s bladder out with a catheter. This emergency room visit determined that it might be a urinary tract infection (UTI) and started him on antibiotics. The patient confirmed he was not admitted to the hospital. The patient then made an appointment with his doctor because that was on a weekend. He saw his doctor who referred him to a urologist. The patient also reported that he did have the normal arm pain and fatigue the second day or the day after the shot.

I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

                                                Myocardial Infarction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other healthcare professional (patient). A 64-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: 20201216-1), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 08:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization, vaccine location provided as Left arm.  Medical history included arthritis and sulfa allergy. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced myocardial infarction on 19Dec2020 23:00. The patient was hospitalized for myocardial infarction for 3 days. The patient underwent lab test which included Covid test via Nasal Swab post vaccination on 20Dec2020 with test result Negative. Therapeutic measure Cardiac cath procedure was taken as a result of myocardial infarction. The outcome of the event was recovering. This case was reported as Serious with seriousness criteria hospitalization.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported myocardial infarction and the administration of COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.  However, more information is required, such as the complete medical history, clinical course, for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.

He received in total 8 me of Epi, 3 shots of Atropine, 3 amps bicarb. He got lasix 40 mg, lovenox 60 mg subcutaneous once. He had a CVC into the right internal jugular, and levophed was started, then Epinephrine drip was started.  Prior to the code he got steroids (solumedrol 125 mg, then later decadron 6 mg iv), benadryl iv, antibiotics (ceftraixone / zithromax), and lasix 40 mg. All this time while in the ED, the Rt was at the bedside, and lots of secretions from the lungs were aspirated, bloody color.   Code was the result of PEA secondary to hypoxia (&lt;/= 85%), despite being on the vent, with PEEP 12, FiO2 of 100%, with acidosis.   After 95 minutes of active resuscitation, the patient was found not responsive to painful stimuli. There was no palpable pulse. No spontaneous respirations. No heart or breath sounds by auscultation. Absence of pupillary light reflex.

One day after receiving the vaccination I took a walk with some hills and had what I believe was a mild episode of atrial fibrillation. I verified as best I could, using a pulse oximeter.  I feel fine for the most part, but a little bit tired and dizzy. I do not plan to call the doctor unless things get worse.

A 64-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), first dose (at the age of 64-years old) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm (reported as injection in left shoulder) on 11Mar2021 at 13:00 (Batch/Lot number UNKNOWN) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included colitis ulcerative from 1982 and ongoing, ongoing seizure (he had seizures for about 6 years and they got worse,  probably it has been 6 or 7 years he has had seizures), high blood pressure, heartburn and insomnia (comes and goes). Concomitant medication included atorvastatin (manufacturer unknown, Tablet) 40mg strength,  oral administration, 20 mg daily (half a tablet at bedtime) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing; cholecalciferol (manufacturer unknown, Tablets) oral administration, 2 tablets in morning taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; escitalopram (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg once daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; lacosamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 200 mg twice daily taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for approximately a couple of years) and ongoing; lisinopril (manufacturer unknown), oral administration, 20 mg daily taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; mesalazine (MESALAMINE, Tablet), oral administration, 4 tablets a day  taken for colitis ulcerative from an unspecified start date and ongoing; omeprazole (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 20 mg as needed (two or three pills daily as he feels like he needs) taken for heartburn and ulcerative colitis from 2001 (approximately 20 years ago) and ongoing and zonisamide (manufacturer unknown) oral administration, 100 mg twice a day taken for seizure from an unspecified start date (for a couple of years) and ongoing.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient received the vaccination on 11Mar2021. After he received his first dose of the vaccine he experienced a bunch of symptoms which he listed as sweating, he could not sleep at all the first night, he was falling down, he had no appetite, and had no energy that same day. This occurred after the 15 minute window of waiting after getting the vaccination. On 11Mar2021, after the vaccination, the patient went to the store to buy groceries and started sweating like crazy. He could hardly carry the groceries to the car. He also had wobbliness. On 11Mar2021, the patient fell down and passed out coming home that night and he had blood all over him. He later clarified that he did not pass out, he got into the house and fell down and somehow landed on the recliner. He was covered in blood and all kinds of stuff. On 11Mar2021, he could not sleep at all that first night and his prescription Melatonin (Manufacturer Rugby) 3mg did not help at all. The falling down occurred roughly that same night on 11Mar2021. The patient stated that they told him they thought he was having seizures again but he was not. He had imaging which showed no seizures and Xray of his brain with unknown results in Mar2021. He had to have another Xray to make sure he did not have bleeding on the brain.  Xray of his stomach showed kidney stones on 12Mar2021. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The patient was scheduled to return for the second dose 01Apr2021.  The patient inquired if he should get the second dose of the vaccine. The outcome of events kidney stone, blood all over him, could not sleep at all and wobbliness was unknown. The outcome of events sweating and falling down was recovered on 11Mar2021 and no appetite was recovered in Mar2021. The outcome of no energy was recovering.  The lot number for the vaccine was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

He is home from the hospital now. We are lining up physical and occupational therapy.

So not sure whether having had Covid caused the clotting. Having the vaccine or being out of work with torn meniscus. They think clots started in my legs and ended up in my lungs. I was brought back after coding for 6 minutes. They seem to think Covid caused it. Not sure if vaccine contributed or not. But it did happen 4 days after the shot.

                                                MI, symptoms started 2 hours after immunization; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 64-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), intramuscularly, administered in the right arm on 14Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0161) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccination facility type was reported. Relevant medical history included obstructive sleep apnea on CPAP; hypogonadism on bioTE; depression; history of (h/o) pneumonia; colon polyps; recurrent sinusitis; erectile dysfunction; MTHFR Mutation C677T Heterozygous; low high density lipoprotein (HDL); dyslipidemia; lumbar disc disease; and sciatica; all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL); anastrozole; celecoxib (CELEBREX); levothyroxine, liothyronine (NP THYROID); and escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM), from which the patient had known allergies. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient experienced myocardial infarction (MI), symptoms started 2 hours after immunization on 14Apr2021. The adverse event (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and an emergency room/department or urgent care, and hospitalization. The patient was hospitalized for the event &#34;MI, symptoms started 2 hours after immunization&#34; for 3 days. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event, which included cardiac stent. The patient was recovering from the event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject vaccine contributed to the event of myocardial infarction.  The reported event likely represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient with history of dyslipidemia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                36 hours following injection of my second Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/21/21, I suffered an afib episode lasting 15 hours starting in the early morning hours of 3/23/21.  I then experienced another episode of afib lasting 19.5 hours on 4/10/21.  On 4/16/21, I suffered my third afib episode following my second injection, which lasted three hours.  As I was converting to a normal sinus rhythm on that day, I went into sudden cardiac arrest for 10-20 minutes and was transported to the local hospital emergency room via ambulance where I was held for approximately 24 hours for observation and testing.  Since that sudden cardiac arrest event, I have experienced two more afib episodes to date, one on 4/26/21 lasting 8 hours and one on May 5, 2021 lasting 6.5 hours.  While I have experienced afib in the past due to a virus attacking my heart in 2018, I had not had any afib episodes for 14 months and had built my ejection fraction back up to 60-65% over a three-year period.  I have never experienced afib episodes with such frequency since my initial conversion to sinus rhythm three years ago following the virus attacking my heart until I received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine along with never, ever experiencing sudden cardiac arrest following the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine.

A 65-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: eh9899), intramuscular on 21Dec2020 at 15:00 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was vaccinated at hospital. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. No other vaccine was given within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not receiving concomitant medications. Medical history included ongoing paroxysmal afib (atrial fibrillation). The patient has known allergies to squid. The patient reported having a long history of paroxysmal afib, very fit, play tennis at the national level. Prior to vaccine have had 2-3 brief bouts of afib/year. Since getting first shot and again after the second shot, have had frequent afib/apc&#39;s (atrial premature contractions) at least 6 episodes. Adverse event start date was reported as 21Dec2020 at 02:00 AM (pending clarification). No treatment was given for the event. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, she has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event is considered possibly related to the suspect product based on the reportedly positive temporal association in a subject with a positive medical history of atrial arrhythmias. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                6 days after the shot I thought I had a sinus infection. I received a  steroid shot and  z pak prescription on the morning of February 18. Was still feeling bad and checked myself into a local ER February 22 where I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Never had heart issues. I was in the hospital 6 days. I feel much better and now worried about getting second shot.

On the day pt was vaccinated, his sister picked him up for the appointment and pt refused a wheelchair. Pt walked into the clinic on his own and recevied his vaccine. Sister reported pt walked to the car after his vaccine and was winded. She dropped him off at his house and called him later to check up on him. Pt stated he was feeling fine but his arm was sore. Pt&#39;s sister called the next morning and reported that he sounded terrible. He was strugging to breathe and was SOB. His sister went over to his house to check on him and wanted to take him to the doctor&#39;s office or the hospital. Pt refused at that time. Pt agreed to make a doctor appointment for later in the afternoon. Sister left at noon. She stated her brother had made a doctor appointment for 4:00 at Family Practice. Upon arriving, pt started walking towards the entrance and became SOB. His significant other asked the doctor&#39;s office for a  wheelchair and was denied. Pt coded in parking lot of Doctor&#39;s Office and passed away at 4:31 p.m.

                                                Patient has substantial bilateral lung PE 12 days post vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional. A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 05Mar2021 (at the age of 65 years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included allergies: penicillin and testim. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 on an unspecified date for covid-19 immunization. The patient had substantial bilateral lung PE (pulmonary embolism) 12 days post vaccination on 14Mar2021 (as reported, pending clarification). The event resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization in Mar2021. Treatment of heparin infusion with rivaroxaban (XARELTO) initiation planned was received for the event. The patient had no covid prior vaccination and had not tested post vaccination. Outcome of event was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event pulmonary embolism cannot be excluded.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

It was reported that the patient had a Covid vaccine this month on 11Mar2021. That was the 1st vaccine the patient had. Next day on the 12Mar2021, the patient stated having some unbalanced in walking and in his train of thinking. The reporter (nurse) ended up on 15Mar2021 taking the patient to Emergency room, and he had a stroke. The reporter stated, &#34;Now, he had a stroke 2 year before. I called to let you know I talked to the neurologist he has sent him to his family doctor for checkup and his family doctor wanted me to let you know that this happen. Does not know if there is any relation or not but just to let you all know and this coming Thursday, he is supposed to get his 2nd vaccine. I am, just calling to let you know&#34;. The patient was taking medication for his 1st stroke and now he is taking medication for his 2nd stroke (treatment).

                                                Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 65-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Mar2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, bleeding ulcer and helicobacter pylori infection both from 15Feb2021, and ongoing tumor on his heart. Concomitant medication included lisinopril taken for high blood pressure. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 in the left arm on 26Feb2021 (lot number: EN6203) for COVID-19 immunisation. Right before he had his first shot, he was in the hospital on 15Feb2021 with a bleeding ulcer and a helicobacter pylori infection. He had been in the hospital and isn&#39;t sure what all they gave him then. The patient started lisinopril 4 or 5 years ago when he was diagnosed with high blood pressure. His blood pressure was under control with the lisinopril but the patient is no longer on it. The patient&#39;s father had a stroke when he was 42 but he had high blood pressure and didn&#39;t get it treated. The patient got up around 07:00 in the morning on 27Mar2021. The patient&#39;s wife got up at 08:30 when she realized something was wrong. The patient said when he got up around 07:00, he experienced his right side being numb. The patient went to the emergency room and was treated there. He had a stroke. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 to 30Mar2021. The patient&#39;s wife doesn&#39;t know if it has anything to do with the shot. After his stroke, they put him on &#34;carvilo&#34;. When the patient was in the hospital for the stroke, they found other issues. He has a tumor in his heart that&#39;s a pretty good size and the doctor said it had been there for awhile. So, they put her husband on &#34;carvilo&#34; to help with his blood pressure and his heart. She doesn&#39;t think the tumor had anything to do with the shot because the doctor did say the size of the tumor was as big as it was because it had been there a while. They found the tumor while trying to find out why he had the stroke. They still haven&#39;t found a reason as to why he had the stroke. The tumor is on the right side of his heart and they said they didn&#39;t think that had anything to do with the stroke. The tumor was found on 28Mar2021. They did an MRI and a CT scan on his head when he was in the emergency room (ER) on 27Mar2021. They also did an ultrasound on his heart, chest, and abdomen. Since he&#39;s been out, they did an MRI on his heart. They also did X-rays on his lungs. He is getting ready to go back to the hospital for open heart surgery on 07May2021. Outcome of the event was unknown.

He only had a total of 2 episodes of AFIB in the last year. His prior AFIB episodes would have been about 4-5 minutes. The last time he had AFIB that lasted any length of time was when he was hospitalized for AFIB around Jan2020. He said at that time, he was hospitalized overnight for observation. He received medication during the hospitalization and his AFIB broke. He didn&#39;t remember what medications were given to him during the hospitalization. He said he had flutters before that hospitalization, but the flutters were always gone after a few minutes, so he never sought treatment because there would be nothing to treat. The patient reported he noticed the rest of the day on 29Dec2020, right up to going to bed that he felt cold. His house wasn&#39;t cold, and he didn&#39;t have a fever. He said the cold feeling went away during the night while he was sleeping. He said the cold feeling easily lasted for a 12 hours. He said the cold feeling could have been something else.

At 8pm, my heart was racing very fast and took blood pressure,  It was very high, 152/105 pulse 74.  I called 24hr nurse on call.  She said call 911. Ambulance was on site within 5 minute and transported me to hospital.  I was in the ER at least 6 hours, moderating my heart.  They said I had an A FIB attack.  They got it down and admitted me to the hospital.  I also experienced pain in my bladder, I could not urinate.  They had to drain it 2 times.  I was released from the hospital at 8pm the next day.  Any questions, don&#39;t hesitate to ask me or my doctor.

The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

Long time delays occurred while scheduling further testing (CT and MRI). Summary from MRI:  &#34;Study Result Impression:  There is diffusion restriction along the left thalamus consistent with subacute ischemia, greater than 6 hours in etiology but less than 2 weeks.&#34;  Outcome:  Vision is slowly improving, headache is mostly gone, vertigo &amp;  mental status slowly improving.

Called 4/1 wanted me to take the third dose (second dose did not meet requirements of CDC guidelines). Third dose on 21Apr2021, 22Apr2021 had 104.7 fever, AFib, in hospital four days. Stopped 22Apr2021 Inlyta. See oncologist 28Apr2021.  Felt good when I was on it. Little bit tired, doing okay. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included pyrexia: 104.7 on 22Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of afib, 104.7 fever and tired with the medication as directed. Outcome of the events afib, 104.7 fever and tired was recovered for on an unknown date and remaining events were unknown.  Follow up attempts needed. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the reported events of atrial fibrillation and fever cannot be excluded, due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Resident was vaccinated on 12/31/20. Then on 1/14/21 he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine surveillance PCR testing.  Another resident on the same hall was COVID positive on 1/11/21.  Results of the PCR test were obtained on 1/16/21.  He appeared asymptomatic at that time. Given his COVID positive status, all aerosol generating procedures had to be stopped. Overnight on 1/16/21 into 1/17/21, he had the onset of acute respiratory failure and was transported to the hospital. Per notes, he was put on BiPAP for several hours, but his CO2 level did not improve. Per prior advance directives completed with the resident and his two brothers, he had DNR/DNI orders.  The hospital physician spoke with his brother and the decision was made to  move to comfort care. He was discharged to inpatient hospice and died around 4pm on 1/18/21. This outcome does not appear to be vaccine-related, but death from COVID-19 infection is listed as a reportable event following COVID-19 vaccination.

The patient received his second dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021 and two weeks later he was found down/ was found down unconscious at the nursing home and his oxygen was in the 60&#39;s on 15Mar2021. The nursing home did not know if her brother hit his head because it was unwitnessed. The patient was found down, not responsive, and it was an unwitnessed fall. The patient was treated as a trauma patient and that this occurred around 10 oclock on 15Mar2021. At that time, he was transferred to a local hospital to the emergency room and put on oxygen. They transferred him within 4 hours because they did not know what to do. Caller adds that the hospital thought that he had a subdural hematoma but the hospital does not have a neuro radiologist, so the hospital transferred to the other hospital that somebody with head knowledge can look at his CAT scan. The patient was misdiagnosed with a subdural hematoma because there were changes in his CT scan from his 3 previous brain surgeries. The patient had a traumatic brain injury when he was 29, and experienced changes.  The patient was found to have submassive bilateral pulmonary emboli on 15Mar2021 described as central lobar sub segmental PEs in both lungs, PE was within the distal right main artery, pulmonary artery distal left main, left middle lobe, middle right lobe / upper right lower lobe and middle lobar, segmental and sub segmental pulmonary arteries. The patient also had pulmonary emboli in the distal left main pulmonary artery of left middle lobe and left lower lobe, pulmonary arteries. There was also some degree of right heart dysfunction which was diagnosed by contrast. On 15Mar2021, the patient also had right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein. The patient is in a nursing home, the doctor did not want to listen to the reporter because her brother is a nursing home patient and they just assume he is immobile but he is not.  The patient underwent lab test and procedures which included Blood sugar very high (they think it was because of heart strain and acute injury because then it came down down down), A1C elevated, Haptoglobin elevated, elevated troponin. These results were all elevated and from acute injury. At the time of the report, the patient is feeling better and needs less oxygen. The events found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism, right femoral vein emboli/ occlusive thrombus visualized in the right proximal femoral vein, and some degree of right heart dysfunction caused hospitalization from 15Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The reporter absolutely does believe the events and the suspect drug are correlated. Outcome of found down unconscious, unwitnessed fall and oxygen saturation low, pulmonary embolism was recovered on 18Mar2021 while it was unknown for the other events.

                                                severe grand mal seizures; he only has half of his memory; some of his levels were high last week in his bloodwork; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8730 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 13:10 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing hypothyroid which he have had for 15 years. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine for hypothyroid which he had been taking for too long to remember, over 10 years. The patient took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206) in the left arm on 08Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The reporter (patient&#39;s wife) called about the Pfizer vaccine for COVID 19. She called to report that her husband almost within 24 hours after receiving his second vaccine, he a had severe grand mal seizure and had to be hospitalized from 31Mar2021 to 02Apr2021. She confirmed that he have had severe grand mal seizures on 31Mar2021. She said that he did not regain conciousness afterwards and that this was within 24 hours after receiving the 2nd vaccination. When probed for end date, the reporter stated that they could not find anything wrong with him. She said he only has half of his memory on an unspecified date. There was a lasting memory effect. He is on seizure medications, he is not allowed to drive for 1 month because he had the seizure, he has a zoom call meeting with his doctor on 19Apr2021. She says not driving is a problem, he is trying to work from home. She said upper arm for shot location then consulted her husband in the background who said both shots were in his left arm. She said he takes low dose thyroid medication. She consulted her husband in the background for some information. After giving some information she says no he doesn&#39;t take anything else. He is never sick and he&#39;s never ever been hospitalized. This is his first time ever. She said her son says when the body gets into that condition, it enters fight-or-flight, he went into fight, 5 firefighters had to hold him so they could give him the calm-you-down medications in the ambulance. One was his son, he said that he had the power of 10 men. She said her husband doesn&#39;t remember any of it. She says he is very healthy. For investigation, she said, well everything turned out negative. She says he had a CT scan, MRI, EEG, bloodwork, urinalysis on an unspecified date in 2021 and they can&#39;t find anything wrong. She said that they just said everything was normal. She said some of his levels were high last week, on an unspecified date in 2021 in his bloodwork and his doctor wanted him to do bloodwork again in 3 weeks. She said several things were high. The events required a visit to emergency room. She said that the fire department took him. She did not visit the physician office until after he got out of the hospital where he saw his primary doctor. She said she wanted to include on the report that it scared the crap out of her. She said, she was holding his neck up and tilting his head up to make sure he was getting air. She wanted to let everyone know what happened. The outcome of the event Grand mal seizure was recovered with sequelae on an unspecified date while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.

A 67-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation (Age at vaccination: 67 years). Medical history included diabetes. Concomitant medication(s) included atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]); colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]); lisinopril; insulin taken for diabetes mellitus. The patient experienced thrombocytopenia, he had clot in the legs and in the lungs and have a low platelet count on an unspecified date. The patient was hospitalized for the events on an unspecified date. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CBC: unknown result on 08Apr2021, Heparin associate antibody: unknown result, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP): unknown result and platelet count: low on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of thrombosis included Heparin drip and Argatroban. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events are considered unrelated to BNT162B2 vaccine, being rather intercurrent occurrences. Clots in the legs and in the lungs were likely favored by the mentioned diabetes and by a possible hyperlipidemia (the patient was taking  atorvastatin) in a setting of possible arterial hypertension (the patient was taking lisinopril).  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 67-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was reported as none. It was reported that the patient had no known diseases or conditions. The patient had no known allergies. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications (&#34;other medications in two weeks&#34;) were reported as no. It was reported that the patient was not on any medications prior to the adverse events. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EL9266) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 03Mar2021 (at the age of 67-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced sore arm. On 25Mar2021 at 08:45 the patient experienced I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm and on an unspecified date the patient experienced typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID. The clinical course was reported as follows &#34;I had just sore arm after shot 1, but after shot 2 I went into a-fib. I also had the typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID and itchy inner arm.&#34; The adverse events I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm resulted in a physician office visit and the event I went into a-fib required treatment with blood thinner and calcium blocker. The patient was tested for COVID-19 post vaccination on 07Apr2021 with a nasal swab which was negative. The clinical outcomes of the events I went into a-fib and itchy inner arm were not recovered/not resolved and the clinical outcome of typical reported symptoms that mimic COVID were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Atrial fibrillation cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Mar2021 10:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included knee surgery, dislocated shoulder (he has dislocated that shoulder in the past several times but had no recent issues), carpal tunnel syndrome and, rheumatoid arthritis, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. In Mar2021, the patient experienced pain in the arm opposite where he received the injection. He reported he like had a muscle tear that it has an intense excruciating pain. He took three aspirin and put a heating pad on it that didn&#39;t touch it. He then reported that the pain went to his knee and it &#34;got all blow up&#34; and stated that that knee had to be drained. He then stated that the calf on his other leg &#34;got messed up&#34; and was found to have a blood clot as well as fluid on that knee. He reported that it was as stiff as a board and that he could not walk on either of his knees for a couple of days. He reported that he still has problems with the one knee that &#34;blew up&#34; and had to be drained but stated that the inflammation in the calf where blood clot was has receded and is back to normal. He stated that he had to visit the emergency room twice and see an orthopedic surgeon for these issues and has been prescribed Xarelto to take to treat the blood clot. In the morning his leg was stiff. It was also reported that the patient&#39;s right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated on 16Apr2021, blood clot on right leg on 12Apr2021, and pain in groin on 13Apr2021. The pain in his groin went down, but his calf swelled to twice the size and it felt like a horse because he was favoring it. It felt like a muscle cramp. The orthopedic saw him for his left knee and he was seen in the Emergency Room for his right and they called his primary doctor. He tried to work and paid the price with his left knee. He has been taking Tylenol and icing it. The last two days (unspecified date) he has been babying it, the weather has been not so great, so he is laying low and give it a rest, but knows he is supposed to get up and move around so he has been doing that and elevating it. He would like to know if, based on these symptoms he experienced after the vaccine, he should get the second dose of the vaccine, which he states he is supposed to get on Tuesday. The outcome of the events &#34;Right knee swelled and felt like it dislocated&#34;, and &#34;Pain in groin&#34; was recovering, and for other events was unknown.

                                                Shot administered Wednesday morning. Sore arm, but not particularly bad. Thursday and Friday I was feeling a little fatigued, and took a nap (very unusual for me) Friday. That night i felt a little strange, light-headed.  Saturday around 10 AM I developed a moderate headache, and then was mildly short of breath, and most concerning, a little bit of afib. My heartbeat was steady (nothing like the afib I first had about seven years ago or so), but I missed about seven or eight beats in a minute (my pulse is usually around 60). That was not regular. My wife thought I might be having a migraine (I have had about five in my life), but if so it was very mild. On her advice I had about a quart of water over a couple of hours, and both symptoms resolved. Currently fine.

                                                acute myocardial infarction; He was found by his secretary unconscious; feeling unwell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), intramuscular in the left arm on 19Jan2021 (at 68-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.   Medical history included blood cholesterol of 200 (not further specified).  The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included irbesartan (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 19Jan2020 at 08:00, after the vaccine, that patient was at work and was feeling unwell and the patient was found by his secretary unconscious. An ambulance was called. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was 79/38 and electrocardiogram showed acute myocardial infarction. He underwent one stent placement with the remaining arteries normal. He was also started on ticagrelor (BRILINTA), metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and atorvastatin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient immediately improved and was feeling well and resumed exercise. The clinical outcomes of the unconscious, acute myocardial infarction, and feeling unwell were recovering. The events required emergency room visit and were assessed as serious for requiring hospitalization for 2 days and being life-threatening.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that reported events acute myocardial infarction, unconsciousness and feeling unwell are related to BNT162B2.  The events are more likely intercurrent medical condition for this elderly patient.

My wife called police to try and find me.  When I finally go home, I couldn&#39;t remember anything of the events of the day.  The following morning (Sun.

I still can not remember getting the vaccine or any of the events of 02/13/2021.

I then was assisted to the bed, where my left arm and left leg felt numb. I rested assuming this would fade away, being I has some numbness from the 1st vaccine.  On 3/24/21, as I attempted to get up from the bed,   I could not maintain my  balance and gait. The numbness was still in my entire left arm and entire left leg, yet I was able to raise move and wiggle my limbs, toes, fingers to a degree.

A 68-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 68-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included paraplegic, he has been paralyzed for 45 years. The patient received first dose of the vaccine on 10Feb2021 with lot number: EN5318, expiration 31May2021. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient went on Monday to the ER for an unrelated condition and they did a CT scan and found a blood clot, a pulmonary embolism in his right lower lobe. He confirms the pulmonary embolism was diagnosed on Monday, 15Mar2021.  He got home that night and read the headline in the (Withheld) times that said several European countries are pulling the Astra Zeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots even though there has not been any causal relationship found. He thought that with the drug companies, they should be able to have data regarding potential adverse effects for Pfizer so he was calling report that. He discusses it with the ER doctor and he couldn&#39;t really figure out why he had a blood clot, it was incidental to what he was being scanned for, it surprised him. They put him on Eliquis so he is on an anticoagulant, which will cost him a fortune. Today will be the third day he has been on the Eliquis. He is at home and he would say his only concern is that he does have hemorrhoids so when he has bowel movement tomorrow, because he doesn&#39;t go every day, but when he goes he is concerned if he starts to bleed that the anti-coagulant might cause the bleeding to be more significant than it usually is. No further information provided. His only other concern is he seems to have some kind of hypothermia, he is not entirely sure because of his thermometer is not very good. That is the reason he went into the Emergency Department because it kept reading 94.7 and he googled it and it said if it is below 95 it is a medical emergency and go to the ER so he got to the Emergency Department and it was 97.6 and now he checked his temperature again with the thermometer and it was 96.8 so either he has a faulty thermometer or something but he is experiencing some kind of chills.  The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 68-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) (at the age of 68-years-old) as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and weak immune system. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. The patient underwent nasal swab COVID test on 10feb2021 with negative result, nasal swab rapid PCR COVID test on 15Feb2021 with negative result. On day one (12Mar2021), patient experienced normal tenderness at injection site, by day 3 (14Mar2021), got sick, had daughter call in LEVAQUIN 7 days worth. The patient experienced continuing chest pain from continuous coughing, BP and oxygen all over, over next 2 weeks less physical activity. On 06Apr2021, patient went to ER, had been in and out of ICU battling COVID/ pneumonia as they say. He received plasma from recovered COVID patient and Remdesivir. The patient stayed so isolated in his home; his daughter did all his shopping meds everything. Her family had been tested and was tested several times. The patient stated that he was afraid his COPD and weak immune system couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. The events required a visit to the Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic, Emergency room/department or urgent care and led to prolongation of hospitalization (as the vaccine was received during existing hospitalization (as reported)). The events were assessed by the reporter as life-threatening (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient was hospitalized for 21 days. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

A 69-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 12Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood clots (reported as blood thinner). Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 2019 and ongoing as blood thinner. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199) at the age of 69-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Feb2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization which gave him severe diarrhea, nausea, gastrointestinal distress, a sore arm and it wore him out. After the second dose of the vaccine on 13Mar2021 which was administered in a public health department, the patient experienced sore arm. He was concerned because around 02:00 on 19Mar2021, he got up to go to the bathroom and noticed his left leg was basically numb and rubbery.  As soon as he tried to stand up, he fell. He thought the second vaccine was the one everyone says will be harder than the first. They even gave him a sheet of paper that scared the hell out of him. Thought he was okay after the second vaccine until around 02:00. At first, he thought his leg had just gone to sleep. It was like having noodles for legs. The patient has been urinating almost non-stop which also started around 02:00, this was what woke him up. He had to crawl on hands and knees after falling to get into the bathroom, he had no strength except a smidgen of strength in the right leg. On 18Mar2021, while eating dinner, he had trouble holding his fork and did not think much about it. He had a cramp feeling in right hand. Today, while eating lunch with a fork, he also had a difficulty. The patient eats with his right hand. The patient has been trying to learn how to walk since early this morning. He has worn out his wife since she was cleaning up after him in the bathroom and helping him walk. He couldn&#39;t walk to the commode very well, couldn&#39;t hold his water, and has been making a mess all day. He was at first afraid he was having a stroke but had no stroke symptoms. The patient reported that his weight was 201, then mentioned that during the night he thought about how much he was urinating and got on the scale out of curiosity and it said he weighs 191. At this time, his leg weakness persists but he was able to stand and hold his own body weight. Issue with holding fork and cramp feeling in right hand was persisting. Urinating was persisting and stated he was going about every 2 hours and goes a lot. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 17Mar2021; unknown for stroke, fall, and weight loss; and not recovered for all other events.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

Since taking the vaccine I have been experiencing several episodes of AFIB every day.   I  have a Kardia diagnostic  tool which confirms the AFIB episodes.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

Then his wife asked if he was alright as he had yelled for her prior to that.  She went and found him on the floor, but stated that he was alright.  Did not hit his head or anything.  Got him up and lied him on the bed.  His left leg was under his right leg and she asked him to straighten it out, and did not respond with an answer regarding moving his leg.  Was looking at her with a glazed look and did not answer, and did not talk or respond to anything.  He was propped up against the door and did not respond she called 9-1-1.  They took him to the hospital, did not respond.  Now his left side is paralyzed and he did have a brain bleed in the front cerebral lobe.  To this day 3/1/21 has been in the hospital and still does not have movement on his left side.  He is able to talk now every now or then, does speak sentences more, and other days he&#39;s not able to speak or move.      On 2/20/21 because he has been able to talk, and not able to eat they had to insert a feeding tube into his stomach.  At that time he was at one place for 1 day and transferred to Hospital until 2/27/21.  He is now at Retirement and Skilled Care facility for rehab.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.

Presented to Hospital on 4/7 complaining of shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting  with elevated troponin and NSTEMI. Low suspicion that the vaccine caused this man?s heart attack as his hear cath showed severe multi-vessel disease. Pt gave inconsistent history in previous COVID infection: he told some he did have it and others that he did not .    CT surgery was consulted, and patient was not felt to have viable targets for CABG.

Allergy consulted due to anaphylactic reaction several hours after procedure. Patient was stable on RA at time of presentation and vitals were normal and stable during the procedure from 8-9 AM. Procedure log reviewed. He received fentanyl, versed, heparin, omnipaque, and xylocaine during the procedure. No immediate reactions noted and no change in vitals during procedure. He tolerated procedure well and was transferred to the cardiac recovery room on RA with normal vitals.   At 1217, patient received percocet and at 1 PM, desaturations noted on flowsheets (84% from RA). Noted pain level of 10/10. HR increased to 130s-150s and BP did drop as low as 99/87. Per notes, he developed shortness of breath, rash, and itching with this. Given albuterol, racemic epinephrine, diphenhydramine IV, famotidine IV, and solumedrol. After developing nausea, he was given IM epinephrine at 2:10 pm. Then, symptoms rapidly improved and he was transferred to CVICU. He was shortly weaned from BIPAP (briefly hypercarbic) to nasal cannula and eventually 1-2L NC.

He received a second dose of COVID vaccine yesterday about midday.  Shortly thereafter, he started having shivers and shakes.  The concern that I had when he called the office was a possible bacteremia.  He was sensitive emergency room for evaluation.  He was noting that he was chilled and was unable to get warm. He said his temperature was up to 100.5.  He had generalized weakness and inability to get up and walk and had malaise.  He has no known exposures to pneumonia or other illnesses.  He has basically been homebound for the past year with the COVID.  He was evaluated in the emergency room and found to have an elevated white blood cell count on the right upper lobe pneumonia on portable chest x-ray.  Blood cultures and urine culture were obtained since he had a urine abnormality as well.  The patient was admitted to observation while we wait on cultures and we treat the pneumonia with antibiotics.

                                                Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus; Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; COVID-19 confirmed by positive COVID-19 test / COVID pneumonia; blood clot; blood pressure was low; Respiratory arrest; Respiratory failure; Hypoxemia; ventricular tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting on behalf of the husband. A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

A 71-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular Right arm on 22Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), hypercholesterolaemia. No other vaccine in four weeks. There were other medications in two weeks. No covid prior vaccination. Clinical course reported as: Patient got vaccine with no issues. 36 hours later he developed entire body itching. He then developed vision issues and passed out while driving. He was hospitalized and no cardiac or neurologic issues were found. The reporting physician suspected anaphylaxis since patient had severe itching with the event. There were no other likely triggers found during history other than the vaccine. Events onset date reported as 23Jan2021. Events resulted in Emergency Room Visit and Physician Office Visit. Covid test type post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 06Feb2021 result: Negative. Treatment received for the events. Outcome of events was Recovered/Resolved with Sequel.

Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter has memories of that, and reporter does not want that to happen again. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue: Patient did not go to church on Sunday. Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness. Reporter knew then that she had to get patient to drink water. Reporter thought that patient might be dehydrated. Patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100: A-Fib started the morning of 26Mar2021. It was resolved completely by the same evening, about supper time. After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office. Patients heart rate continued to be erratic until supper time, but it was not bad. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours.

                                                stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable pharmacist.  A 71-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 02Apr2021 09:00 (Lot number: EP7533) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported and there were no known allergies. Concomitant medications included rivaroxaban (XARELTO); empagliflozin (JARDIANCE); lisinopril all taken for an unspecified indication. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) intramuscularly at the age of 71-years, at single dose in right arm on 05Mar2021 09:00 (Lot number: EN6199) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced stroke on 11Apr2021 (Stroke 7 days after injection (as reported)), it resulted in &#34;Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event) and Disability or permanent damage&#34;. The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 2 days. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and he had not been tested for COVID since the vaccination. Event outcome was not recovered.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke is likely due to an underlying medical condition and unrelated to BNT162B2. Although temporally related, there is no sufficient evidence that the reported stroke is related to BNT162B2. Note that the patient&#39;s medical history was not reported, however, patient is taking rivaroxaban and lisinopril for unspecified indication. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 72-year-old male patient (patient&#39;s husband) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Feb2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included liver replacement from 29Nov (unspecified year), cold, sore shot. When probed for medical condition, reporter stated no, she could remember that he had a cold when he get the sore shot every year and get pneumonia vaccine. He had liver replacement on 29Nov (unspecified year), no side effects or anything, no blood clot. He walks every day. No diabetic no any other complicated factor. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EL3249) on 07Feb2021 (at the age of 71-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and Pneumonia vaccine. It was reported that, reporter stated, she don&#39;t know how she just brief, but she would give the best she could. Reporter&#39;s husband has the Pfizer vaccine on 07Feb2021 and for the second does on 28Feb2021. He was 73-year-old now with no complicated factor, no history, and no adverse reaction anything like no allergy. Everything was fine, and on 07Apr2021 approximately five and half week after the second dose. He had to go to the emergency room as he could not breathe and he was diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolism in both lung on 07Apr2021, no precipitating of event, no logical explanation that the doctors could tell, they put him on Eliquis to recover up the blood clots, 19 days later 26Apr2021 he was back in to ER. He was severe headache, nausea, vomiting. Side effects of the blood thinner. He was diagnosed with cerebral hemorrhage on 26Apr2021. We flight to hospital because we live in a small town no neuro surgeon available to get immediate surgery. The doctor told he was calm down, but they took him off from blood thinners and she don&#39;t know what she expect more blood clot, what going next, he feels fine, he still had some headache which doctor said it would leave the month because of the blood in the brain. There was no after explaining and no logical explanation what have happen other than the blood thinner, he could take blood thinner. She don&#39;t know why the clots come back, that&#39;s why she want to report this because this all way comes on with the Pfizer. He was fine with the other vaccine that have five weeks after later. When probed any question regarding side effects, reporter stated, well she just kind a need to know, what to expect. If this going to be ongoing thing with in and out of ER. What to expect, we don&#39;t know. Doctor was following up. He has Hematology appointment on Wednesday to try to figure out the consequences. Reporter stated, she was on hold for 40 minutes and she could not even report this as a serious possible adverse reaction of the vaccine and to the drug. He merely died twice. When probed was patient still experiencing the side effects, reporter stated, well he was still tired. He still have the headache it&#39;s not severe. He went to the emergency room. We are watching him on helping here to follow up. He was taking medication of anti-seizure Keppra because body has strains body so that&#39;s making him tired. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

I have always been an active healthy person with no major issues other than one Stent put in my Left Descending Artery by doctor in June of 2013. I&#39;ve been playing Tennis (mostly singles) on weekends till last November and I&#39;ve been playing Ping Pong on weekdays till end of April. Never expected to getting this PE. Could this blood clots be the result of Pfizer Covid Vaccine ?

                                                Patient expired. Per Emergency MD note: &#34;This is a 72-year-old male with what sounds like diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension who presents via EMS in cardiac arrest.  It sounds like he received his Covid vaccine last week.  Initially he had some mild effects from it.  However over the last day or so he has felt very unwell.  He apparently called his wife today and told her that he was not feeling well and so she returned home.  Shortly thereafter he attempted to get up from his chair.  He then collapsed and fell forward onto his face.  Sounds like his wife had some difficulty rolling him over to perform CPR.  When EMS arrived they found him in PEA.  He received a total of 5 rounds of epinephrine.  At some point they did have return of spontaneous circulation.  However just prior to arriving in the emergency department they lost pulses again.  The patient was intubated with an 8 oh endotracheal tube prior to arrival.&#34;

                                                very sick/high fever/get weaker/diagnosed with double pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife).  A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot # EL3247, intramuscular in left arm on 15Jan2021 (at 1500 or 1600) at single dose to prevent covid. There were no relevant medical history or concomitant medications. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2. There was no prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). The reporter stated on 16Jan2021 the patient got very very sick. He started running a fever, a high fever a high temperature all day on 16Jan2021 through 17Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night the reporter took him to the emergency room and they said it was from the covid shot. The patient began to get weaker on 17Jan2021 (not resolved) and still with a fever (resolved in Jan2021) and they said it was the shot. They went to a walk in clinic where they did a covid test on 17Jan2021 which was negative and they gave him medicine for possible pneumonia. But he didn&#39;t get any better. They went to another clinic where he had 3 more tests on 17Jan2021, &#34;a covid test, a throat culture/ strep test and a flu test that all came back negative&#34;. On 18Jan2021 his family doctor advised him to go the hospital and he was diagnosed with double pneumonia which was resolving. The reporter stated that the event required a visit to Emergency Room and Physician Office. The reporter wanted to know if he will be able to get the second shot and asking if the first dose of the covid vaccine give him pneumonia. The medicine they gave him did not seem to be doing a lot of good, he was admitted for 3 days last week (since Jan2021 to Jan2021) and he received iv antibiotics. The medicine that was not doing good she clarified was oral pills of azithromycin (Lot: KJ9712, Expiration: Jan2022. NDC: 0781808926)that was to be taken at home. The outcome of the event was not resolved.

                                                Pulmonary embolism; Multiple clots in his lungs; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient wife). A 72-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number unknown and expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 10Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (EL8982) on 19Jan2021. The reporter (wife) stated that she and her husband both took the Covid vaccine. The patient (husband) is the one who have the adverse reactions. On 19Jan2021, she and her husband had the first shot, the Pfizer Covid shot. On 10Feb2021, they had the second shot. Just today she picked her husband from the hospital, they dismissed him for today because on 18Feb2021, she had to take him to emergency room because he had pulmonary embolism. He has multiple clots in his lungs. This is nothing that they dealt before with him. The reporter is afraid that it might be related to have taken the vaccine. Reporter stated that when she took him to the emergency room, it was 18Feb2021. Now he had a little shortness of breath for few days before the 18th but they didn&#39;t realize that he was having a big problem. He fully developed this on 18Feb2021. The reason for hospitalization was pulmonary embolism and blood clots in his lungs. He is little bit slow like the reporter said she got him to the hospital where he stayed 3 days she guess with pulmonary embolism, from 18Feb2021 to 21Feb2021. He had lot a of lab work while he was in hospital on these days the wife described. He had blood work, Echocardiogram, CAT scan, Ultrasounds, Chest X-ray, Covid rapid test, they haven&#39;t got back the result yet. Outcome of the events was unknown.

He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

                                                I woke up the morning of February 16, 2021 with my heart beat racing (resting rate 130&#43; bpm&#39;s).  So I went ahead and did several readings with a Kardia device which showed AFIB, Tachycardia, and PVCs. I have those readings available upon request. The cause is likely from my second Covid 19 shot that was given to me Saturday, February 13, 2021. I cannot think of any other variables that would have caused this irregular hear beat. Since this event occurred, I have been in regular contact with my Cardiologist. My daily ekg&#39;s are showing frequent arrhythmias, mostly PVCs.  I&#39;m currently going through a series of tests to determine a course of action going forward (CT Cardiac Scoring, EKG&#39;s, Echocardiogram, etc.)

                                                In march I started becoming SOB and it continued to progress.  It became so bad that I could only walk about 5-10 feed before becoming totally exhausted, needing to sit down for a few minutes.  My heart rate remained sinus-tach running up to 120&#39;s.  On March 4, 2021 I had an appointment with Dr.   He sent me to the Hospital to have a CTA.  The test was positive for a MASSIVE bilateral PE.  Doppler studies of my lower extremities showed a partially occluded Palpitate vein in my right leg.  I was admitted to the hospital and started on Heparin IV.  I was also taken to the Cath- lab where I underwent a Thrombectomy of my right lung.  The Cath-lab quit working so the procedure was stoped and the left lung was not treated.  On admission to the hospital my O2 sat was 97%.  After the thrombectomy my O2 sat went to 83%.  I was placed on Hiigh-flow O2 via nasal cannual.  On March 8th I was started on Lovenox SQ for 30 day and discharged from the hospital on March 9th.  I am now on Eliquis 5 mg bid and doing much better.

Tee revealed no cardiac source of embolism. He is left with some expressive and receptive aphasia. He also has some loss of L eye vision. There was no stenosis of the carotid arteries but the left M2 branch was occluded. He did not have any atrial fibrillation in the hospital but is wearing a 30 day monitor currently.   We have no idea this was related to the vaccine but wanted to report. The Neurologist thinks it is just a coincidence.  But we still want you to know it happened.

                                                Blood clot in right lung; Sore left arm at injection site; Shortness of breath; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose intramuscular, administered in the left upper arm on 03Feb2021 at 09:00 (batch/lot number: EL3248) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (prevention). Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from Dec2009 to an unknown date (takes daily pills for rheumatoid arthritis), squamous cell lung cancer early stage from Aug2018 to an unknown date, lung surgery to remove small portion of that and went on chemo in Aug2018, skin cancers prior to getting the vaccine, reading glasses (he needed prior to getting vaccine), blood pressure (abnormal) (takes blood pressure medication; takes daily pills). Family medical history was reported as none. Concomitant medications included nivolumab (OPDIVO) taken for squamous cell lung cancer early stage from 17Jan2019 to an unspecified stop date (getting it every 4 weeks for 2 years and 3 months; the bag was 480 ml); and unspecified blood pressure medication and rheumatoid arthritis medication. The patient experienced blood clot in right lung on 25Feb2021, sore left arm at injection site on 03Feb2021 and shortness of breath on Feb2021. The patient had the first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 03Feb2021 and second one on 01Mar2021. He did not really have any special events but then he had a CT scan on 23Feb2021, which was about 20 days after first shot. When he went in for doctor&#39;s meeting a couple of days later, they said he had a blood clot in right lung. He later stated he was not positive it was in the right lung. He told his doctor that he just got the shot, but they said they had not heard of any reports from Pfizer of people getting blood clots in their lungs after getting it. He thought about reporting then, but did not. He has no evidence that the blood clot in his lung was related to the vaccine. He was also a lung cancer patient and was on an immune therapy drug nivolumab from (name). He has been on it for over 2 years and started Jan2019. He was diagnosed with cancer back in Aug2018. It was squamous cell lung cancer early stage. He had lung surgery to remove small portion of that in Aug2018 and went on chemo. On 17Jan2019, he started on nivolumab immune therapy drug. Fortunately, it worked extremely well. He immediately started recovering and was feeling better. The last few CT scans indicated he had no sign of disease. It does not mean he was cured, but was healthy otherwise. The nivolumab spurred his immune system to eat the cancer cells. It stimulates your immune system. It has been a pretty successful drug and has been on the market for about 5-6 years. He and his wife both got shot on same date. The word on the street was that you should ask for Pfizer because it seems to have less side effects that people can get for vaccines. Pfizer&#39;s reputation has been known for having less common serious side effects. He had a sore arm and it went away about a day later. They prescribed rivaroxaban (XARELTO), a blood thinner, for his blood clot which he went on and got on a day or two later. He was hoping it was gone. He feels better. At the time, he did not know he had the blood clot. He visits his doctor for treatment for nivolumab every 4 weeks and every 4 months, they do a CT scan. At his last visit, he reported that he was still fine but lately experienced some shortness of breath. It was occasional and it comes and goes and was not all the time. He plays golf and noticed the shortness of breath during his game. He quit a couple of holes early and did not want to take any chances. The doctor later told him that a blood clot in your lung can contribute to shortness of breath. When he started rivaroxaban it was 2 pills a day for about 2-3 weeks and it was a starter dose. It was a little more in the beginning. He thinks it was 10 mg twice daily and then it went to 1 tablet a day for the last week at dinner and now it was 15 mg once daily. The two combined were greater to jump start you. It was not a special dose. He then corrected dose to 15 mg rivaroxaban twice daily for the starter dose for 2-3 weeks and one tablet daily for the last week of the starter. Then he switched to maintenance dose of 20 mg daily. He did not have a lot or expiration for the previous dose of 15 mg. The lot and expiration for the 20 mg was unknown because he believes the label was covering it. He stated he needed to get his glasses to read bottle. They were reading glasses and he needed prior to getting vaccine. Nothing has changed with his vision. He was hoping to get off of them and has never been on them. He hopes it was not a long term thing. Second dose was given 01Mar2021, Pfizer COVID vaccine, BNT162B2, expiration was unknown. Injected in left upper arm in the muscle (intramuscularly). Second dose administered at 09:20-09:30. He takes blood pressure medication and did not see it was relevant. Takes daily pills for that and rheumatoid arthritis. In the past, he had a few skin cancers. All were prior to getting the vaccine. They were some squamous and basal cell. He has had nothing in quite a while. Nivolumab was helping skin issues. Squamous cell skin cancer was the same family as lung cancer. He did not have a lot or expiration for the nivolumab. He received it by IV infusion. Shortness of breath was mid Feb2021, on and off for a couple of weeks prior to doctor visit on 25Feb2021. He usually does not have much to report and mentioned it. It did not prevent him from doing anything and was not debilitating. One of his fellow golfers said he was huffing and puffing and he just poo pooed it away. He had a flu vaccine in Oct2021 (as reported). No further details provided. Blood clots in right lung morning time, unknown time. Sore left arm at injection site noon - to late in the day of the shot. Shortness of breath - sometimes he feels it in the morning or midday if active. He cannot say a straight time. No emergency room (ER) or physician&#39;s office visit required. Vaccination facility type was clinic. Not a military facility. On 25Feb2021, normally scheduled office visit and did the CT scan on 23Feb2021. He went in separate for that. He had the treatment on Thursday. He has another CT scan scheduled in third week of May2021. They were doing it early because of the blood clot. Hopefully, it was gone by then. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks): 1st and 2nd Pfizer COVID vaccine as mentioned above. CT scan on 23Feb2021, positive for small blood clot in single vessel in what he thinks was his right lung. All of his previous trouble with the lung cancer was in his right lung. He has never heard of anyone else having blood clots related to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He does not think he has heard of any and wanted to know if there were any. He knows there was something in the press about the (name) vaccine with blood clots. When you do 120 million and have a handful of people, you may have a few things. He did not have any information on the people for (name) to report on. He knows of others who have had the vaccine and no one had any symptoms. No further details provided. The outcome was recovered on 04Feb2021 for the event &#34;sore left arm at injection site&#34;; recovering for the event &#34;shortness of breath&#34;; and unknown for the event &#34;blood clot in right lung&#34;.

                                                Beginning the day after the inoculation, my husband began feeling worse in terms of his difficulty in breathing.  He used the  Albuterol inhaler more than usual.  It progressively got worse over the next 2 weeks, ending with my husband?s sudden collapse and death exactly 2 weeks later on April 5, 2021.  The inoculation may or may not have been directly linked to his unexpected death, but I feel it may have exasperated his condition, which led to his death.   And I feel it is important to report this to you.  I later heard that he should not have been using his Albuterol inhaler one week prior to receiving the Pfizer vaccine.  I don?t know if that is true, but that information was never told to my husband, if it is.

A few hours after 2nd covid injection, along with  mild myalgias/prodromal sx., I went into atrial fib., with mild tach. but no other problems.  The arrythmia persisted for ~24 hr.s then converted back to sinus rhythm-- and fine since.  This event is more of an interesting observation than an &#34;adverse event&#34; but as the spike protein binds to ACE2 receptors, I thought the two events might be related and possibly of interest to you.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

A 73-year-old male patient (husband) received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EM9810), intramuscularly administered in arm left on 06Feb2021 at age of 73 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial flutter, cardiac ablation from Jan2020, tooth infection, root canal, ongoing prostate issues. Concomitant medication included tamsulosin hydrochloride (FLOMAX) taken for prostate issues from an unspecified start date and ongoing, medication for nasal congestion (He had a lot of sinus issues. It was mainly nasal sprays that he used). The patient previously took penicillin BK for tooth infection, clindamycin for tooth infection, amoxicillin for tooth infection, paracetamol (TYLENOL) for pain. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation on 16Feb2021. This case was a serious report with Seriousness criteria-Caused/prolonged hospitalization. Reporter said that her husband got the first dose of the vaccine on 06Feb2021 and on 15Feb2021 he went to the cardiologist. She said that he had a history of atrial flutter and had an ablation over a year ago in Jan2020. She said that he went in for a routine check. She said that he had been off of his cardiac medications because he was doing fine after the ablation. The doctor told him to follow up in a year. On 16Feb2021, he started having weird things going on with his heart. He took some medication to help the rate of his heart. Reporter clarified that he took Metoprolol (TOPROL XL) 50mg that he had in the house. The doctor told him to take it in case something happened. She said that there was the chance that he had Afib and was just asymptomatic. They never saw any evidence of Afib previously though, just AFlutter. He had no episodes of Afib. She said that previously he went off of his medications and was doing ok. They were told to buy a watch that monitors his heart rate. Reporter said that when she checked his heart rate on the pulse ox it was 180. She called an ambulance and he was admitted to the hospital for atrial fibrillation. She said that they had to do a cardioversion in the ambulance on the way there and it was a significant occurrence. Her husband experienced Afib about 10 days later after the vaccine, was cardioverted on the way to the hospital and was hospitalized due to atrial flutter. Reporter stated doctor told them they didn&#39;t see any correlation with the vaccine. Reporter wanted to know if these symptoms were reported before. She said that during this period of time, he had been on 3 different antibiotics for a tooth infection and had a root canal. She said that he took these from the beginning of Jan2021 for about a week each. She said that his tooth infection was not any better or was worse and they would try another antibiotic. Reporter clarified that the antibiotics were Penicillin BK first, then he was on Clindamycin the second time, then was on Amoxicillin the 3rd time. He was also on Tylenol 3 for the pain during this as well.  The patient took 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EM6198) intramuscularly in the Left arm on 01Mar2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The outcome of events was unknown.

A 73-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 14Feb2021 at 15:45 (Lot Number: EL3247) (at the age of 73-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, family history, or concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: E10142 (as reported)), in the right arm, on 24Jan2021 at 15:45 (at the age of 73-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung in Feb2021, which required hospitalization from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated he did not know what date the blood clots occurred and can&#39;t tell when that happened, but it was maybe a few weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. He stated that one blood clot is in the right leg near the calves and the blood clot broke and split some and went up into the side of his lung as it was detected in a doppler on 27Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized from 27Feb2021 to 28Feb2021. The doppler was performed as soon as he went into the emergency room and they went through a series of tests with unknown results on 27Feb2021 and 28Feb2021. The patient stated that the right leg is bigger than the other leg and they told him it might stay that size and may not go down. The patient is now on apixaban (ELIQUIS) 5 mg for the rest of his life. In the beginning, they gave him an unspecified shot in his stomach, then after that he began taking apixaban at two pills in the morning and two pills at night, then they cut him down to 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening, and he started it right when he went into the hospital immediately. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of blood clots after the 2nd dose and blood clot split and some went into side of lung was unknown.

A 73-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included psoriasis , cardiac pacemaker insertion on an unknown date (He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago) , hypertension from an unknown date.      The patient  died three days after taking the vaccine  on 09Apr2021 , he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat on 09Apr2021 with outcome of unknown.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 150/90   on  09Apr2021.    It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Course of the event: The reporter&#39;s uncle died three days after taking the vaccine. He was at home getting ready to watch a basketball game with the reporter&#39;s aunt when he began to complain that he felt strange and he felt like something was in his throat. Both the patient and the reporter&#39;s aunt are also RN&#39;s. My aunt checked his BP and the first time it was 150/90. His BP was taken a second time but the reporter cannot remember what  the 2nd reading was. He then said he was going to the bathroom and asked her to call # because he felt like he wasn&#39;t doing well.  The reporter&#39;s aunt  called #, and assisted the reporter&#39;s uncle to lay down in bed. She remained on the phone with #who arrived at the scene shortly thereafter. They performed CPR at the scene and he was transported to the hospital. The reporter  believes the patient was pronounced dead at home. The patient was about 5&#34;10, heavy set stature. He recently had a pacemaker implanted several months ago and has a history of psoriasis and HTN. There is additional concomitant medical history I will have to confirm.   Information about lot/batch has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment for the reported patient&#39;s sudden death.

                                                shortness of breath, chest xray with pulmonary edema, periorbital edema Narrative:  73 yo M w/ PMH HTN, HLD, EVAR (2013) for AAA c/b persistent type II endoleak s/p multilple repairs (2015 &amp; 2017) c/b glue embolization down into the R CIA secured with additional stent placement with the R iliac limb, s/p b/l Iliac artery aneurysm stent 08/31/20, and PTSD. Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

A 74-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: EL1283) at 0.3 mL single on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid; hypertension, was under control with the medication; dementia, taking memantine as a treatment for dementia, no other impairment other than what he normally has from his dementia. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; memantine for dementia; fish oil tablet; Vitamins. Patient had a mild heart attack and a slight stroke and he did have urinary tract and blood infection on 24Jan2021. They both had the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 20Jan2021, Saturday night into Sunday. He was a dementia patient, alert to his name. On 24Jan2021, he fell out of bed and couldn&#39;t get up, he was flushed, so patient&#39;s wife took his temperature, he had a fever of 101. Patient&#39;s wife couldn&#39;t move him, so called the paramedics and they took him to Hospital. Patient&#39;s wife just found out that he had a very mild heart attack and slight stroke, no impairment other than what he normally had from the dementia. Patient&#39;s wife was wondering should he get the second shot and what was the timing of the 2nd dose of vaccine. Reporter seriousness for mild heart attack, slight stroke, urinary tract and blood infection was hospitalization. They also have him on some sort of penicillin derivative for a urinary tract infection. Since he had been to the hospital, he had at his doctor&#39;s office about 2 weeks ago today, he had a blood test, a urine test. His A1C was 6.5, there was a little blood in his urine. For that since Sunday (24Jan2021) he was having MRI, he had a couple of PET scans, he had an electrocardiogram. The neurologist came in to check on him. He was in hospital now. Hospitalization date was 25Jan2021 early in the morning. The outcome of events was unknown.

The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

He was off pressors but remained intubated due to poor mental status with unclear etiology. It could be related to liver failure, vs neurological insult vs renal failure. Head CT 4 days prior on the 2/24 were without acute intracranial pathology. Hepatology was consulted and did not believe the liver was the main etiology behind poor mental status. Patient progressively declined with continuously increased IV pressor requirement. ABG showed worsening lactate acidosis and was anuric. Patient&#39;s family was notified of decline and agreed for the patient to be transition to comfort care early 2/28. Bedside RN notified pronouncing physician of cessation of respiration and cardiac activity.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6203), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 19Feb2021 (at the age of 74years) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL9262) on 28Jan2021 (at the age of 74years) for Covid-19 immunization and stated no reactions. Medical history included high blood pressure and diabetes but are all currently under control and feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered. It was reported that in the past the doctors thought he experienced TIA (transient ischemic attack) but wasn&#39;t sure if that was accurate. Concomitant medications included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL), trazodone (TRAZODONE), insulin (INSULIN), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and prednisone (PREDNISONE); all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. It was reported that on 19Feb2021 the patient received the 2nd dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine and stated he remember feeling some leg pain before the vaccine was administered earlier. On Sunday 21Feb2021, the reporter (patient&#39;s wife) began noticing that the patient was showing symptoms of a stroke. The patient&#39;s one leg was rapidly kicking, and his speech began to slur. The patient was then rushed to ER (emergency room) and hospitalized. At the hospital it was confirmed that the patient was having a stroke. The patient recovered and was doing rehab for his leg. Few weeks later, the patient had an accident in his home while getting up to go to the bathroom and fell. The patient was rushed to the Trauma center. The patient&#39;s wife was upset as she carried their vaccine cards to the trauma center to confirm to staff that the patient did not need another Covid vaccine shot and later found out that the patient was given a 3rd (Moderna Covid vaccine) at the trauma center. The patient stated that he does not think the vaccine was related but was upset that the trauma center did not listen to her to take the info with the complete vaccine card present to avoid 3rd shot from another brand. The patient&#39;s insulin levels are under control, but the reporter was concerned when the patient does not eat within a certain timeframe. The outcome of events stroke and speech disorder was recovered on an unspecified date; outcome of event fall was unknown.

                                                received both of his doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine . Had a migraine after the first dose, and a mild headache after the second dose.  Unclear whether or not he suffered chronic migraines, although there was paperwork at the death scene stating that he had an appointment for a MRI on 3/1/21.  No recent influenza-like symptoms are reported.  He was found dead in his home on 2/22/21, seated at a chair at his desk.    Autopsy findings include an enlarged and dilated heart, granular kidneys, with the right kidney very shrunken and about half the size of the left kidney, and prostate hypertrophy.  There is no trauma.  The airway is not edematous.    Ancillary studies that are pending include microscopy, toxicology (basic testing plus vitreous chemistries), a COVID swab, a respiratory viral panel swab, HIV testing, and neuropathology.  The cause and manner of death on the death certificate will both be ?pending further studies? until these studies are completed.

                                                I had sudden malaise, lost consciousness and my wife says was not breathing briefly. I revived and was taken to the hospital, and treated for 2 1/2 days with heart catheterization and TPA injected into my clot in the pulmonary arteries with good resolution. I did have cor pulmonale with acute severe right heart failure as part of that, Dr. thought the clot came from my right calf by his examination. Diagnosis was confirmed by CAT scan cardiac Echo and right heart catheterization.

Subsequently developed rash 1 week later and was biopsied by Derm subsequently developed cellulitis of bx site and was given keflex. Then developed mouth ulcers/?thrush thought to possibly be Keflex side effect. Had fevers and chills week of 3/19, also body aches, anorexia, and malaise, on 4/13 he presented to ER with bilateral PE, Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (Cold agglutinin disease) and eosinophilia and skin rash resembling livido reticularuis. He was initially reported to be thrombocytopenic with platelet down to 77 but with lots of clumping. Platelet manual count reveled platelet normal at 160, however it was done after patient received IVIG and prednisone. HIT serology came back strongly positive at 2.58 however equivocal (does not neutralize heparin), patient was then switched to Xarelto.

                                                Patient was a healthy 75 year old male when he got the shot.  Within  5 hours, he began to feel TIRED, which was an expected side effect. He felt tired for several days. Nine days later he went to Memorial Hermann ER in Kingwood, and they said he had pneumonia. They also said he had a &#34;small mass&#34; at the bottom of his lung and might want to get it checked out. On March 20, he developed a cough. On March 21 we went to a different ER and a CT scan showed he had plureal effusion.  On the next day he was short winded. He went back to the ER and they admitted him and transferred him to hospital by ambulance.  On March 23, 1.7 liters of fluid was drained from his lung and sent to be tested. On March 26 he was diagnosed with malignant plureal effusion. He passed out at the doctor office and tranferred to to another facility by ambulance. He remained there for 4 days for tests, and a port was put in to drain the fluid. On March 29 he was transferred .  They repeated many tests and did a bronchoscopy.  On April 1 they told him he had squamous cell carcinoma.  He came home on April 2. The doctor called and said they made a mistake he had small cell carcinoma.  He remained home until April 11, when he was taken back to  by ambulance.  He had gone from a healthy appearing individual on March 17 to a critically ill individual and he died on April 15.  Doctors had never seen cancer overtake a man in 28 days. 28 days!!!!  On March 22, he had a small mass at the bottom of his lung, and one week later, it was a mass so large, his lung could not be seen and his lung had collapsed.  Doctors assumed that the cancer was dormant and that the vaccine did something to wake it. It attacked my husband with a vengeance.  He never smoked.
