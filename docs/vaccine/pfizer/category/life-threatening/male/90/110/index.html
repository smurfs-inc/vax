Son went home after that.  He tried to contact him on 3/1/2021 but wasn&#39;t able to reach him.  On 3/2/21 the brother tried to contact him and wasn&#39;t able to reach him.  They contacted the police dept on 3/2/2021 around 8:00 AM to do a well check.  Pt was found on the couch like he had fallen asleep but was deceased.  They suspect he probably expired on 3/1/2021.  No autopsy will be conducted per the son.

                                                Severe abdominal pain unable to eat or sleep for 36 hours. He went by ambulance to the Hospital emergency room. They tried to pump his stomach but he aspirated and and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived but never regained consciousness. (The ICU Dr said that he had blood clots in his abdomen from a recent stroke. We were unaware of him having a stroke other than in 2026. The same Dr. said that he had necrosis in his lungs from aspirating. The necrosis was from his bowel dying) He was put on a ventilator and given drugs to increase his heart rate. On 3-5-21  the heart drugs were reduced and he died. I was with him when he recieved the vaccination and he was healthy, just old. I think that the shot killed him.

On January 17, 2021, he tested COVID positive on a resident screening test done in response to an employee positive case in days previous to the residents testing.  Fifteen days after his first innoculation,his AM nurse found him non-responsive on early vital checks.  Vitals at that time were normal range.  The facility physician was contacted and advised that he should be taken to Emergency Room at local hospital for further evaluation.  Blood work was taken and ER DR diagnosed Heart enzymes elevated indicating a heart attack.  Advised additional testing should be done, and that monoclonal antibody treatment wasn&#39;t an option due to time lapse since diagnosis of  COVID,  The option of comfort care was chosen as the treatment plan.

After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

I spoke with him the evening before (on 1/14), which was a day after he had received the Covid vaccine. He was not having any symptoms of allergy or reaction then. He did say that he felt tired, but he often complained of feeling tired over time.

                                                The vaccine was given on Monday.  Tuesday afternoon he developed weakness in both legs and could not stand up.  This was a new development;  he had neuropathy in one leg but he had been able to stand up and walk three hours before.  He was helped to the bathroom.  He said he felt better and might want to stand up again.  He was helped to bed.  He was found dead around 5:30 Wednesday morning.    He was 94 years old and had a lot of medical conditions.  No one has indicated his death had anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that he died so soon after receiving the vaccine

A 94-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 13:45 (at 94-year-old) at single dose (Arm Right) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is clinic. Medical history included congestive heart failure, early stages dementia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Feb2021 (at 93-year-old) on right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no covid prior vaccination. Patient has no known allergies. The patient (father) seemed to be doing fine until 19:45 on 26Feb2021 roughly 30 hours after vaccination. He has early stages dementia, so if he was feeling ill he didn&#39;t report anything, and they didn&#39;t notice anything. He got up from the table, notably shuffled the 10 feet to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet before we could &#34;pull down his pants&#34;, and then became non-responsive. The reporter said to her son it looks like he is having a stroke. They got him onto the floor. started him on his oxygen concentrator (usually used only at night), O2 went from 85 to 98; bp 155 from an unspecified date. after a while he came to. he is dnr, dni, so they didn&#39;t call an ambulance. Eventually they got him up. no signs of stroke. He does have congestive heart failure. This has never happened before, and he has no history of falling. Daughter was reporting the next morning. He has not yet been awake since this occurred. it is now 8am 27Feb2021. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event o2 went from 85 to 98 was recovered, while for other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

On 1/30/21 around 8:30pm, he needed assistance in the bathroom related to weakness and had what was later identified as a stroke with left side weakness and slurred speech.  In accordance with his wishes, he had care at home.  Due to his advanced age and frailty, a CT scan was not pursued.  The 325 mg of aspirin that he was previously taking daily was discontinued.  After the stroke, he needed total care. Hospice was established at home.  Nursing assistant care was delivered by daughter.  Death followed 9 days later (2/9/2021).
