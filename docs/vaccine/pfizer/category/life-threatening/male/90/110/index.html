Son went home after that.  He tried to contact him on 3/1/2021 but wasn&#39;t able to reach him.  On 3/2/21 the brother tried to contact him and wasn&#39;t able to reach him.  They contacted the police dept on 3/2/2021 around 8:00 AM to do a well check.  Pt was found on the couch like he had fallen asleep but was deceased.  They suspect he probably expired on 3/1/2021.  No autopsy will be conducted per the son.

                                                Severe abdominal pain unable to eat or sleep for 36 hours. He went by ambulance to the Hospital emergency room. They tried to pump his stomach but he aspirated and and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived but never regained consciousness. (The ICU Dr said that he had blood clots in his abdomen from a recent stroke. We were unaware of him having a stroke other than in 2026. The same Dr. said that he had necrosis in his lungs from aspirating. The necrosis was from his bowel dying) He was put on a ventilator and given drugs to increase his heart rate. On 3-5-21  the heart drugs were reduced and he died. I was with him when he recieved the vaccination and he was healthy, just old. I think that the shot killed him.

On January 17, 2021, he tested COVID positive on a resident screening test done in response to an employee positive case in days previous to the residents testing.  Fifteen days after his first innoculation,his AM nurse found him non-responsive on early vital checks.  Vitals at that time were normal range.  The facility physician was contacted and advised that he should be taken to Emergency Room at local hospital for further evaluation.  Blood work was taken and ER DR diagnosed Heart enzymes elevated indicating a heart attack.  Advised additional testing should be done, and that monoclonal antibody treatment wasn&#39;t an option due to time lapse since diagnosis of  COVID,  The option of comfort care was chosen as the treatment plan.

After second vaccination, was not able to stand or move after 36 hrs, at which point he was taken to the hospital. At hospital, all vital signs were good except an MRI showed cancer in spine.  Shot was given 3/1 and my father passed on 3/18.  Obviously this shot did not cause metastatic cancer, but I believe it did induce an inflammatory response of some kind that caused it to progress extremely quickly.

A 91-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number and expiration date not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 16Mar2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included deaf. Concomitant medications were not reported.

The patient also felt a little off on 16Mar2021 and required a visit to the emergency room and physician office. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a clinic. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. There was no family medical history relevant to events and no relevant tests done. Outcome of the event pneumonia was unknown while not recovered for the other event. The reporter mentioned that they didn&#39;t think that pneumonia was related to the vaccine.   Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, pneumonia is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2, this is an intercurrent medical condition. Potential contributors include patient&#39;s advanced age as the risk for infections is higher in this population. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received

                                                After the first dose my father got what the eye doctor thought was pink eye. After treating him it didn&#39;t clear up. It was later diagnosed as herpes of the eye and he became blind in one eye. Shortly afterwards I read an article from researchers who stated they had found fragments of the herpes virus in the vaccine. After the second vaccine he was fine one day and 2 days later started having seizures. He was hospitalized for the seizures. His personality totally changed. He no longer recognized my sister. He also became hostile which is not the person he was. He was released from the hospital and brought to a new facility. Then the lights went out. he just stared off into space. A day later he was dead.

He was at therapy from 12:36 pm until 1:22 pm when he stated he was too tired and could not do anymore. The therapist took him back to his room at that time and he got into bed himself but stated his legs felt heavy. At 1:50 pm the CNA answered his call light and found he had taken himself to the bathroom. She stated that when he went to get back into the bed it was &#34;abnormal&#34; how he was getting into it so she assisted him. At that time he quit breathing and she called a RN into the room immediately. He was found without a pulse, respirations, or blood pressure at 1:54 pm. He was a DNR.

                                                My father was in weak condition to begin with.  He didn&#39;t get out of bed for the next few days after receiving the vaccine.  The little amount that he ate was consumed in bed.  He began aspirating his food which lead to pneumonia.  He wasn&#39;t strong enough to fight off the pneumonia even with antibiotics.   He died on 1/23/21.   While he might have passed soon in any case, I believe that the vaccine may possibly have increased his weakness/exhaustion thereby hastening his demise.

He just received his second dose of his covid vaccination 3//26.    Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to receive treatment for COVID 19 infection.  On presentation he was hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen, he was in Afib RVR. He received experimental treatment with plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. He had a AKI in setting of infection that improved, and his lasix was added back. He has CKD3, would recommend re-check cr in 3 days after discharge.  He did develop acute urinary retention that required a foley to be placed. Void trail in hospital was unsuccessful, suspect relatedd to weakness/poor endurance.  Can considner ongoing voiding trails as his health improves and or outpatient urology consult.  Paroxysmal Afib in the setting of viral infection, with fluids and increasing metoprolol rates improved.  Once he recovers from Afib can consider MCOT to evaluate Afib burden, continue ASA     Covid pneumonia Acute hypoxic respiratory failure, from COVID Pneumonia Received convalescent plasma Received Dexamethasone 10 day course  Completed remdesivir 5-day course on 4/4/21  Oxygen Requirement continues at 2 L nasal cannula Inflammatory markers trended down He was vaccinated SECOND INJECTION on 3/26.    Acute kidney injury on chronic kidney disease stage IV Creatinine improved with IVF did upwardly trend again likley from acute urine retention  Cautiously watch Cr while on  Lasix, consider checking CR/BUN in 3 days Monitor creatinine, avoid nephrotoxins Discharged with foley, continue Flomax. Consider voiding trails at SNF and/or urology consult   Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation -new onset Metoprolol tartrate increased during hospitalization patient will benefit from outpatient event monitor to determine A. fib burden once he recovers from Covid, to be arranged by PCP continue aspirin

                                                The vaccine was given on Monday.  Tuesday afternoon he developed weakness in both legs and could not stand up.  This was a new development;  he had neuropathy in one leg but he had been able to stand up and walk three hours before.  He was helped to the bathroom.  He said he felt better and might want to stand up again.  He was helped to bed.  He was found dead around 5:30 Wednesday morning.    He was 94 years old and had a lot of medical conditions.  No one has indicated his death had anything to do with the vaccine.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that he died so soon after receiving the vaccine

A 94-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 13:45 (at 94-year-old) at single dose (Arm Right) for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type is clinic. Medical history included congestive heart failure, early stages dementia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 04Feb2021 (at 93-year-old) on right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had no covid prior vaccination. Patient has no known allergies. The patient (father) seemed to be doing fine until 19:45 on 26Feb2021 roughly 30 hours after vaccination. He has early stages dementia, so if he was feeling ill he didn&#39;t report anything, and they didn&#39;t notice anything. He got up from the table, notably shuffled the 10 feet to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet before we could &#34;pull down his pants&#34;, and then became non-responsive. The reporter said to her son it looks like he is having a stroke. They got him onto the floor. started him on his oxygen concentrator (usually used only at night), O2 went from 85 to 98; bp 155 from an unspecified date. after a while he came to. he is dnr, dni, so they didn&#39;t call an ambulance. Eventually they got him up. no signs of stroke. He does have congestive heart failure. This has never happened before, and he has no history of falling. Daughter was reporting the next morning. He has not yet been awake since this occurred. it is now 8am 27Feb2021. Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event o2 went from 85 to 98 was recovered, while for other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Grandfather died within a week and a half after his vaccination; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This the first case out of six cases. Patients grandson reported for the patient (reporters grandfather) that a 97-year-old male (same age during vaccination) patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date of 2021, as single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patients medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Reporter stated that So, he doesnt exactly know. His grandfather was the first phase to get the Pfizer vaccination (Confirmed as Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine) back in March (Further not clarified). He was in a residential home with 5 other elderly residents with him. They all got vaccinated with the first Pfizer shot (Confirmed as Covid 19 vaccine) and they all died within the 5 weeks after their first shot. Honestly the only thing that he can pinpoint with my aunt and other people and loved ones we have talked to come together because only two of the residents were on hospice and the other people were not on hospice. They should not have died they just died. he doesnt know if it was a side effect, he knows if it was a reaction but all of the six residents that got vaccinated died within their first vaccination shot. Within the 5 weeks after the first vaccination. He was not sure other residents got the second vaccination, but his grandfather died 09Feb2021. Reporter stated he only have detail for his grandfather and other residents, and they died in their sleep supposedly. They died in their sleep. Both of them died in their sleep (Further not clarified hence not captured in tab). He just feels, his grandfather was not on hospice he was healthy considering the underlying problem that they had but they were supposed to get vaccinated with the Moderna and the day that we got there they changed the vaccination to Pfizer. So, they had the on-duty nurse there to answer any of the questions that we had. We asked then all the questions we had. We felt ok with it, everybody got vaccinated that day. My grandfather died within a week and a half after his after vaccination. So, he didnt get the second and by the middle of march their resident also died. The only thing I can tie to it is the first dose of Pfizer vaccination. Regarding Height and weight reporter stated he do not know exact. he wont say he was 5 (feet) 8 (inches) when he passed away, he believed either between 115 (pounds) and 120 (pounds) when he passed away. Outcome of the event was fatal.
