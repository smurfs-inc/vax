A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm on 05Mar2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 76-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement couple of years ago. Concomitant medication includes aspirin 325mg once per day by mouth. On 05Mar2021, the patient went into Afib, his heart rate went up and the next day on 06Mar2021, his blood pressure dropped really low but his pulse went really high and carried it that way for a few days and then he went pretty much back to normal.  On 05Mar2021, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation for 22 hours and since that time his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic. The reporter stated that the patient has returned to normal and his pulse is still a little high and his pulse used to run in the 70&#39;s and maybe 80 but today (15Mar2021), the pulse was still 95; on 06Mar2021, the patient took his blood pressure twice and is not sure at what time he checked it but one time it was 98/65 and the pulse was 114 at that time and the other time the blood pressure was 88/59 and the pulse was 115. States the patient&#39;s blood pressure pretty much turned back to normal on 10Mar2021 and the blood pressure started being normal on 10Mar2021. On 15Mar20021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 140/76 and the pulse is still real high at 95 today and he weighs himself, takes his blood sugar and blood pressure every day. Regarding the treatment, the reporter and the patient saw the patient&#39;s cardiologist this past Friday 12Mar2021 and put the patient on Metoprolol and the blood thinner Eliquis; states the patient was just taking a whole Aspirin and had previously had aortic valve replacement a couple of years ago and the HCP reduced his aspirin dose down to a low dose of Aspirin and then put him on the Eliquis at the HCP appointment. The reporter stated, for the Metoprolol and Eliquis she does not know the dosages or frequency of how the patient takes them at this time; states she has no lot numbers for the Metoprolol, Eliquis or Aspirin to provide as they are not with her at this time. The outcome of the event his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic was not recovered; while the other events was recovered. Treatment has been given for the events.

                                                On December 30th my father tested positive for COVID.  He was reported asymptomatic by the care facility staff. He was given vaccine on Jan 14th and began feeling ill that evening. The morning of the Jan 15th the nursing facility had my father admitted to emergency and then to ICU. He stayed in the hospital for 10-14 days and then was released on hospice at the senior care facility. He passed away on Jan 31st.  I&#39;m not sure if the sudden change in my father&#39;s health was due or made worse due to the COVID vaccine as the hospital was treating several symptoms,  but the timing seems suspicious. I have also not been able to get an explanation for why he was given a vaccine if he tested positive.  I do not know which vaccine was given, but needed to select one to submit the form.

Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae. The following day a chest tube was inserted and the course of ertapenem completed but vancomycin was continued. By 1/22, patient developed shock liver with ALT/AST 2135/1579 from normal range the day prior and SCr increased to 1.3 from baseline 0.7/cystatin C of 2.46 up from 1.15. Levofloxacin was added for Stenotrophomonas coverage. By 1/25, patient&#39;s clinical status continued to decline and Cardiology was consulted for new onset Afib with RVR. Discussion was documented with patient&#39;s family who requested DNR. Patient passed away in the early AM on 1/26.

On 2/17 (three days after vaccination), he sought care in the emergency department for chest pain that worsened when he was supine and shortness of breath.   EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.

Per report from primary care - the patients wife reports that the patient went on Saturday (1/30/21 - about 1050) morning to receive his COVID vaccine. He returned home and told her about the experience and denied any side effects. He then proceeded to sit in his easy chair for a while and around 1:30, she asked him if he wanted any lunch. The patient&#39;s wife reports he &#34;grumbled&#34; at her, and then got up to go to the bathroom. She then heard a loud crash and found him lying on the floor of the bathroom, with his head knocking hole in the wall as he fell. She could not detect a pulse. She called 911 and began compressions. First responders to the scene likewise tried to revive him but were not successful in her efforts. Per primary care documentation - Uncertain if related to Pfizer vaccine; vaccine administered on 1/30/21 and approximately 3 hours later suffered fatal MI at home.

Mid afternoon I sat up on the edge of the bed to go to the bathroom and passed out falling on my left knee (bad one) and hit my forehead on the bathroom door scraping and bruising same above left eye brow. Walking with pain in left knee but getting better daily.

                                                During my earlier years working in an industrial area I had inhaled asbestos which caused me to have plural thickening in my lungs. Every year since that diagnosis I have been required to annual Pulmanary (lung and heart) testing. On February 11th I had my 30th annual Pulmonary exam consisting of EKG, Stress Test, and Chest X-ray. As in the past, results were all good. On March 3rd I had my 1st Pfizer vaccination. Five days later on March 8th I collapsed, was taken to the hospital by ambulance having suffered a massive Pulmonary Embolism affecting my heart and right lung. During my 2 hour operation, Surgeons used a flexible suction tube inserted thru my groan to remove a large blood clot (embolectomy). Pieces totaling about 14cm long, 2cm wide and 1/2 cm thick. I was discharged 3 days later and instructed to take blood thinning medication probably for the rest of my life. I am now 78 years old.

Patient had some mild clinical decline the past few days prior to 2nd vaccination, with a decreased appetite and some increased fatigue per nursing report, but no significant changes. He experienced nausea on the evening of 1/6/21, which was effectively managed, but by early morning he spiked a fever of 102.9 with a sat of 86.1%. He continued to deteriorate from that point on and died 1/7/21 @13:20. Clinically, the presentation was most consistent with an aspiration pneumonia.

Patient was hyperkalemic and in acute renal failure at time of transfer. Hyperkalemia was treated, but the patient suffered PEA vs VFib. At the time of transfer, patient was on vasopressin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The patient had an EF of 40-45% and elevated troponins.  Patient was made DNR and placed on comfort care. Patient passed away on 1/18/2021. Ultimately we suspect that the patients condition was a direct result of his underlying disease states, but wanted to make sure reporting was made available.

Patient drove himself to the hospital for evaluation and treatment on Saturday, March 27th where he collapsed in cardiac arrest. he was resuscitated and stabilized on life support. He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                My Husband and I received the same day a strong pain in our left arms. The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

Pt presented to hospital on 04/28 w/ complaints of nausea and vomiting. He stated that he had recently gotten his COVID vaccine. Pt was found to be in acute liver failure in the ED w/ AST and ALT &gt; 1000. Lactate &gt; 15.0. BMP showed AKI on CKD and BG &gt;500. Pt did have cardiac arrest while undergoing CT Scan and ROSC was achieved after CPR x 20 mins.  Pt was hence transferred to the ICU for higher level management and admitted for cardiac arrest and acute liver failure.   Upon arrival, Pt was intubated and sedated. He was non-responsive to verbal and physical stimuli. Pt was acidotic. ABG: 6.99 / 28 / 165 / 7. 1 amp of HCO3 was given upon arrival. Pt was started on insulin gtt for DKA and was started on Levophed for low BP.  Pt underwent cardiac arrest shortly after arrival to the ICU. CPR was performed for &gt; 20 mins without ROSC. Family arrived at bedside and decision was made to stop CPR at 0205 on 04/29/2021.

                                                patient passed away after receiving the Covid vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), intramuscular  into the right arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization.  There was no medical history and no concomitant medications.  On 08Jan2021, the patient passed away after receiving the COVID vaccine.  The patient died on 08Jan2021.  An autopsy was not performed. Investigations indicate that unspecified labs were done, but nothing two weeks prior; no further details were provided. The patient received the first dose the day prior. The reporting nurse discussed it with the medical director, and he thought that he potentially passed away from the COVID vaccine. The relatedness of the event to the suspect vaccine was reported as related by the reporting nurse per The Agency.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up .; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information available, it is medically not possible to make meaningful causality assessment, it is unlikely the vaccine could have contributed to the death of the patient based on the known safety profile. However case will be reevaluated when additional information is received during the follow-up  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Stated that the patient passed away after receiving the Covid vaccine

                                                My 81-year-old father, and my brother received the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at the  Hospital  on Wednesday January 13, 2021. Within a couple of minutes of them returning home, my father collapsed. As it turns out, he&#39;d had a silent heart attack. He is still in the medical center area Hospital this morning. A cardiologist who was filling in for my father&#39;s primary cardiologist thought maybe my father had a blockage and might have needed a stent. But when Dr. performed a cardiac catheterization,  he only found a little plaque. Medical personnel are not too sure what caused the heart attack. My was very dehydrated when he was admitted, and he has underlying health conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, dementia and a history of blood clots. Those are just a few of his health issues. His primary cardiologist, Dr is back in town. He plans to see if my father has AFib before they release him. I believe Dr. an internist at Hospital,  said my father&#39;s INR on admitting was 1.2. My father&#39;s hematologist, Dr.,  had told us to let the person administering the vaccine know that my father is on blood thinners. I was not present when my father and brother received the vaccine, but I assume my brother passed that information on to them.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 18:00 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. He did fine right after, his arm wasn&#39;t sore, he felt fine. The next day he had nothing, no soreness, nothing, he felt great the next day. Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had his first vaccine dose on 04Jan, then 7 days later he was in the hospital with a really high eosinophils count and infiltrate in his lungs, they did a CAT scan, and he had pneumonia in there. Patient&#39;s wife said that he was in the hospital for three days for Pneumonia, and now he was out of the hospital and he was supposed to get his second dose of the vaccine on the 25th. She would like to know if her husband should have the second dose, since she didn&#39;t know if the pneumonia was caused from the vaccine for sure, it could be an allergic reaction for the vaccine since his count was 22.2 for absolute eosinophils and that was down now to 2.4. She would like to know if it was safe for him get the second dose. She said her husband was still coughing and she didn&#39;t know, she was afraid for him to get it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included a CAT scan in Jan2021 and he had pneumonia in there , absolute eosinophils: 22.2 (Eosinophil count high) in Jan2021, absolute eosinophils: 2.4 in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Stroke; like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

The patient was seen at the physician&#39;s office.  Treatment included EKG; Xeralto anticoagulant.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination.  The outcome of sudden onset of Atrial Fibrillation was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event cannot be completely ruled out given the implied temporal association. However, underlying medical conditions may provide the alternate explanations. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Received voice message on 4/6 from daughter that client had died several hours after receiving vaccine.  Also reported he had underlying health issues so unsure of cause.  I made telephone call to daughter on 4/6.  Daughter was wanting report made and plans to do so with additional health information included.  I informed daughter I would be making a report also.

                                                On February 20, 2021 in the early evening my husband began to experience chest pain and pressure, took Tylenol, however did not relay the symptoms to me. About 6:50 AM on February 21, 2021 told me that he did not feel well, had chest pain and pressure in his chest. An ambulance was called and my husband was transported to the Hospital. I was contacted by the treating physician and was told that my husband suffered with a Pulmonary Embolysm (sp?). He was started on Heparin and admitted to the hospital. Later that evening his medication was changed to Eloquis. He was released from hospital the following evening. He has since followed up with his primary care.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

An autopsy was not performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Lacking information on the cause of patient&#39;s demise, the Company cannot completely exclude a causal relationship between COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, and patient&#39;s death of unknown cause, as a cautionary measure and for reporting purposes. The patient&#39;s pre-existing medical condition of metabolic encephalopathy from, failure to thrive (FTT), diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis, weakness, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), dementia may have provided the contribution to the event in this 82-year-old male patient.

An 82-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021, 13:00PM (at 82 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated in the Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included myeloid leukaemia (CML) diagnosed a few months earlier, WBCs abnormal, blood pressure, and heart surgery valve repair. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, vitamin d nos, dasatinib monohydrate (SPRYCEL) from an unknown date to help get WBCs back in normal range; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12), and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), all were received within 2 weeks of vaccination. At 82 years old, the patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiration date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination and did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. It was unknown if patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. On Friday (unknown date in Feb2021), patient&#39;s WBC was 150,000 and on Saturday (unknown date in Feb2021), patient had bilateral blood clots in legs that then went to lungs then went into BLAST crisis. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care as well as hospitalization due to life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the events). The patient was hospitalized for 12 days. Therapeutic measures which include steroids, blood thinners, and lots of other meds were administered. Outcome of the events &#34;patient&#39;s WBC was 150,000&#34; and &#34;bilateral blood clots in legs that then went to lungs then went into BLAST crisis&#34; was recovering.

The patient was admitted with pulmonary embolism and Covid 19 PCR positive (Igg also positive) with chest x-ray consistent with Covid pneumonia, 2 weeks after the 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject product contributed to the events. The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  Pulmonary embolism is known to be a potential complication of COVID 19 infection, including COVID 19 associated pneumonia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including pulmonary angiogram, VQ scan and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This consumer reported the same events for himself and two other patients. This is the first of three cases.   An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 04Mar2021 and first dose on 27Jan2021 (batch/lot numbers not reported); both via unspecified routes of administration as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications were not specified and reported that they were too many to list, also he has quite a list of prescription. The patient stated since he has gotten both COVID shots and it was found out after going to the doctor and to a cardiologist that he was the third person that has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation from taking the COVID shots and since he was the third person that they had recently after both shots, he thought he should call the toll number and report side effects after taking the vaccine. Consumer confirmed the date for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation as 08Mar2021 and stated primary care doctor, he went for his quarterly visit and she gave him an EKG and it showed this the fibrillation and he was immediately sent to a cardiologist who confirmed it after a second EKG and echocardiogram had both of those. Consumer stated it said atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy and mixed hyperlipidemia whatever that was, he has a print out of the diagnosis from the cardiologist in his hand. Consumer stated date of test was yesterday, 08Mar2021. Consumer stated he was given a new medicine Eliquis 5 mg twice a day as treatment. Consumer stated he just wanted to report this, since the doctor yesterday told him that he was the third patient that had both shots and came back with this. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

                                                cardiac arrhythmia; Atrial fibrillation; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. An 83-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Batch/Lot Number: EL8932), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 21Jan2021 as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing , Defibrillator/pacemaker insertion from 2015 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication included insulin (INSULIN) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The next day after 1st dose the patient experienced a 7hr period of atrial fibrillation (all recorded on a cardiac monitor), he stated he was dizzy, light headedness and periods of shortness of breath. He just became aware of this cardiac arrhythmia from his Cardiologist. He has an internal heart monitor and the Doctor was able to see this report. He was now taking medication for A-FIB. It was reported that patient never had it until the night he got the shot. The outcome of the events was unknown.

An 83-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular administered on arm left on 08Feb2021 08:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 02Feb2021) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation (AFib) and he had maybe once or twice a week but never felt it (before Pfizer shot), ongoing hypertension, and Meniere&#39;s disease which had attacks several times a year  and since he lost his hearing in his right ear the attacks were minor (he felt a little nauseous, similar to having a minor hang over and with a louder than normal ringing in his right ear -tinnitus). Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation from 2016 (reported as 5 years ago) and ongoing; and hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) taken for hypertension from 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) and ongoing. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Before the shots, he had an AFib attack maybe once or twice a week never felt it. He mentioned that the only way he knew he had it was using his fitness watch and take his pulse before several times a day (unknown results) and before he exercise (he will not exercise if he was in Afib  but it always went away overnight). His doctor recommends staying hydrated and will see a cardiologist if it does not stabilize. After his first vaccine shot on 21Jan2021  06:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EK9231) intramuscular administered on arm left and while he was at his car, the was in Afib which lasted for 5 days (26Jan2021) which was unprecedented. After about five days, his pulse stabilized and was back to normal having AFib again maybe only once a week (AER 2021194945). Then, the patient received the 2nd dose on 08Feb2021.  By 08:45, the patient was in AFib again for five days (13Feb2021) when it cleared but then it came back almost immediately for another two days and he was not back to normal even after 7 days. The patient also had Meniere&#39;s attack the same time (08Feb2021 08:45) with the Afib he had. He was little lightheaded and get winded very easily during that time and recovered by 13Feb2021 (same time with the Afib). The event of Afib noted on 08Feb2021 was persistent/Significant disability/Incapacity and did not received any treatment.   No follow up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

On his way into the Vaccination Center, he was blown over by high winds sustaining a blow to his right forehead with small abrasion and a 3x4cm subcutaneous hematoma. He  was assisted to a wheel chair and brought into the EMT booth for further assessment. He was awake and alert and oriented during his time with us. He never lost consciousness . He vigorously requested to receive the Covid-19 vaccination which we complied with. Due to the mechanism  of injury and use of an anticoagulant, he was subsequently transfered to Hospital for further assessment and care. We heard on 4/3/21 of his death.

                                                I thought I was having a heart attack; I had severe left arm pain; I didn&#39;t get much sleep that night; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 86-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 08Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient was taking loads of medications. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

                                                The weeks following vaccination, the patient felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable on his feet. Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in 10Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient received one dose of Pfizer vaccine on 10Jan2021. The patient was presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan2021. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb2021 from respiratory failure from COVID19. It was unknown if autopsy was done. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination via nasal swab: covid-19 virus test positive on 27Jan2021. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, and patient died.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID post vaccination and respiratory failure with fatal outcome, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.  More information on the underlying medical condition in this 89-year-old male patient is required for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from respiratory failure from COVID19; presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from

                                                He died around 5 o clock; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 13:00 at a single dose (lot number was reported as NEEU200, the reporter did not know if its 2 or Z) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history allergic to Penicillin, has a long list of allergies, neck pain and sleep disorder (sleep aid). Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), clopidogrel bisulfate, calcitriol, melatonin (MELATONIN) taken for sleep aid, Phillips Laxative tablet Magnesium (not appropriately paraphrased and clarified, as reported), simvastatin, terazosin hydrochloride, tizanidine hydrochloride (TIZANIDINE HCL) for when he had the pain in neck (he didn&#39;t take that hardly ever), vitamin C [ascorbic acid] and Multivitamin one a day. On Friday 12Mar2021, the reporter and the patient went to get the Covid shot. Their appointment was at 12:30 but they were in line long time before they got the shot. They got the shot around 13:00 and then they have to wait 15 minutes before they could leave. They drove up, they were ready to shoot us with the needle and they asked the patient, asked was he allergic to anything and the reporter answered for him and said yes, Penicillin and other long list and then they gave him the shot. They never did go over his allergies. They got home about 13:30, so which would take us about that long to get home. The patient died around 5 o clock and the reporter didn&#39;t know if this was connected or not with his death. The patient died on 12Mar2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case of death was provided with minimal details and autopsy results not available. However, drug causality cannot be completely excluded for BNT162B2 injection, only due to plausible chronological relation. Otherwise, information received was so limited to prevent a thorough medical assessment for patient death. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drugs is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: He died around 5 o clock

Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal.
