A 76-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm on 05Mar2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), at the age of 76-years at vaccination, as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included congestive heart failure, aortic valve replacement couple of years ago. Concomitant medication includes aspirin 325mg once per day by mouth. On 05Mar2021, the patient went into Afib, his heart rate went up and the next day on 06Mar2021, his blood pressure dropped really low but his pulse went really high and carried it that way for a few days and then he went pretty much back to normal.  On 05Mar2021, the patient experienced atrial fibrillation for 22 hours and since that time his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic. The reporter stated that the patient has returned to normal and his pulse is still a little high and his pulse used to run in the 70&#39;s and maybe 80 but today (15Mar2021), the pulse was still 95; on 06Mar2021, the patient took his blood pressure twice and is not sure at what time he checked it but one time it was 98/65 and the pulse was 114 at that time and the other time the blood pressure was 88/59 and the pulse was 115. States the patient&#39;s blood pressure pretty much turned back to normal on 10Mar2021 and the blood pressure started being normal on 10Mar2021. On 15Mar20021, the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 140/76 and the pulse is still real high at 95 today and he weighs himself, takes his blood sugar and blood pressure every day. Regarding the treatment, the reporter and the patient saw the patient&#39;s cardiologist this past Friday 12Mar2021 and put the patient on Metoprolol and the blood thinner Eliquis; states the patient was just taking a whole Aspirin and had previously had aortic valve replacement a couple of years ago and the HCP reduced his aspirin dose down to a low dose of Aspirin and then put him on the Eliquis at the HCP appointment. The reporter stated, for the Metoprolol and Eliquis she does not know the dosages or frequency of how the patient takes them at this time; states she has no lot numbers for the Metoprolol, Eliquis or Aspirin to provide as they are not with her at this time. The outcome of the event his blood pressure and pulse have remained erratic was not recovered; while the other events was recovered. Treatment has been given for the events.

                                                On December 30th my father tested positive for COVID.  He was reported asymptomatic by the care facility staff. He was given vaccine on Jan 14th and began feeling ill that evening. The morning of the Jan 15th the nursing facility had my father admitted to emergency and then to ICU. He stayed in the hospital for 10-14 days and then was released on hospice at the senior care facility. He passed away on Jan 31st.  I&#39;m not sure if the sudden change in my father&#39;s health was due or made worse due to the COVID vaccine as the hospital was treating several symptoms,  but the timing seems suspicious. I have also not been able to get an explanation for why he was given a vaccine if he tested positive.  I do not know which vaccine was given, but needed to select one to submit the form.

A 76-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021 (at the age of 76 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took NSAIDS. The patient experienced DVT L leg, possible PE on 12Mar2021. Treatment given included Eliquis. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported events deep vein thrombosis and possible pulmonary embolism occurred in a plausible temporal relationship.

He had his nurse take an ECG and after his review he said that I had new onset Atrial Fibrillation.  He prescribed the blood thinner, Eliquis 5mg twice daily, and recommended that I schedule an appointment with my Cardiologist.  I had an appointment with cardiologist on 03/17/2021 and he confirmed my Atrial Fibrillation.  He scheduled me for a Transthoracic Echo (TTE) Complete with PRN definity on 04/08/2021 which was completed.   It must be noted that annual visits to my three doctors over a past period of 5 years, never showed that I had an irregular heartbeat or Atrial Fibrillation prior to its first discovery by PCP on 03/10/2021,  exactly one week after my second Pfizer Covid 19 vaccination.

I have never been diagnosed  with this, but have had infrequent bouts with PVC&#39;s. Diagnosis was made at  Hospital ER a few days after onset of symptoms. Visited my Cardiologist about a week after that, but by then my symptoms had disappeared. It is now about 3 months after this episode and I have had no irregular heartbeats since.

He was brought to the emergency room, and a trauma evaluation was negative.  He was found to have a severe junctional bradycardia with a heart rate in the 20s and systolic blood pressures in the 60s.  In addition, he was found to have a creatinine now of greater than 5 when his previously had been in the low 1s. Patient admitted with junctional bradycardia, acute renal failure, hypotension, cardiogenic shock, and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with high O2 needs. PMH significant for CAD, pulmonary HTN, aortic stenosis, obstructive lung disease, and chronic hypoxia. This patient has been made DNR/DNI over the weekend which is quite appropriate.  Patient was found to be unresponsive with fixed/dilated pupils, absent heart and breath sounds, no respiratory effort, absent pulses, and no response to painful stimuli. Patient was pronounced deceased on 03/10/2021 at 0405.

Treatment team COVID-19 virus infection Principal problem HPI: For complete history and physical see the H&amp;P dictated by Dr. on 4/28/2021.  This is a 76-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with upper respiratory symptoms for three days.  He reports having cough, sneezing, runny nose and poor appetite.  His caregiver had Covid recently and he was exposed.  He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted inpatient to the medical surgical floor.  He was not on telemetry.  Patient reports that his caregiver had recently tested positive for Covid and he was exposed.  He has been having upper respiratory symptoms including cough, sneezing, and runny nose.  His COVID-19 test was positive.       He was started on the COVID-19 treatment protocol which included IV remdesivir and IV dexamethasone.  He underwent a CT scan of the chest which showed small patchy areas of groundglass infiltrates in the peripheral portions of the left and right upper lobes and also the posterior aspects of the right lung base.  These findings are probably due to pneumonia.        Hospital course consisted of gentle hydration with IV normal saline.  He was also started on antibiotic therapy oral azithromycin and IV Rocephin.  He had completed the course of antibiotics while on the unit, therefore, at the time of discharge no antibiotics were prescribed.  He initially was hypoxic and started on nasal cannula oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%.  Eventually, oxygen was weaned and pulse oximetry on room air has remained in the 95-96% range.       He has a history of diabetes mellitus and while on the unit blood glucose levels have fluctuated.  His point-of-care glucose have been in the 80-500 range.  He has had numerous episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin has been adjusted.  The fluctuations of the blood glucose levels may be secondary to IV dexamethasone.  At the time of discharge he will continue dexamethasone 6mg daily for the next three days.  He was advised to increase insulin 70/25 insulin five units daily for the next thre days.  After that time he can return to his normal dose of insulin.  He also had been treated with IV remdesivir and had completed the 5-day course.      On examination today he has been asymptomatic.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  The initial lab studies showed an elevated creatinine level, although he has a history of chronic kidney disease.  At the time of discharge the creatinine level trended downward and he was advised to follow-up with the primary care provider for possible repeat BMP in 1 to 2 weeks.  All other lab studies have been within normal limits.        The systolic blood pressure has been in the 120-150 range.  The most recent systolic blood pressure was 151/66 mmHg with a heart rate of 66 bpm.  He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.  He was advised to continue all of his current medications.  While on the unit he was in isolation secondary to COVID-19.  At the time of discharge he should maintain social distancing/isolation, mask wearing and good handwashing.  He will will need to follow-up with the primary care provider.  He was also advised if the oxygen level dips below 89% he will need to return to the emergency department.  At this time he is resting comfortably, offers no complaints and is stable for discharge.       Patient is alert, oriented answering all questions appropriately.  He is continent of bowel and bladder.   Heis able to make his own decisions.  He is able to performhis own ADLs.  .  At this time he is in agreement with the plan and feels comfortable to be discharged home. Thank you.

                                                I had a severe reaction to my 2nd Pfizer shot with projectile diarrhea for 3&#43; days! This seems unlikely since it occurred 9 days after the shot but there&#39;s no other explanation. This left me so dehydrated that I went into AFIB and had to visit Emergency Room.

Patient transferred from Spinal Cord Injury until to ICU on 1/11/2021 due to worsneing dyspnea, hypoxia (80s) and tachycardia and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure likely 2/2 multifocal pneumonia. CXR findings of &#34;There is interval increase in patchy airspace infiltrates and consolidation in bilateral lungs concerning for pneumonia&#34; Patient was started on vancomycin and pip/tazo on 1/11 and tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained for VAP diagnosis which ultimately grew Serratia liquifaciens and Proteus mirabilis. Infectious Diseases was consulted who recommended a switch to ertapenem therapy for a total 10 day course for VAP. UCx/BCx remained negative. On 1/20, a therapeutic bronchoscopy was completed with cultures growing Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and pan-S Klebsiella pneumoniae. The following day a chest tube was inserted and the course of ertapenem completed but vancomycin was continued. By 1/22, patient developed shock liver with ALT/AST 2135/1579 from normal range the day prior and SCr increased to 1.3 from baseline 0.7/cystatin C of 2.46 up from 1.15. Levofloxacin was added for Stenotrophomonas coverage. By 1/25, patient&#39;s clinical status continued to decline and Cardiology was consulted for new onset Afib with RVR. Discussion was documented with patient&#39;s family who requested DNR. Patient passed away in the early AM on 1/26.

Sat down, took prednisone 20 mg and benedryl.  Symptoms lasted for a couple of hours. Rash took several hours to reduce. Continued prednisone overnight.  Next morning seemed very improved.  IT TRULY SEEMED LIKE AN ANAPHALXIS REACTION. Waiting for Health Dept. nurse manager to call back.  As noted, this Anaphalixis occurred 72 hours after the vaccination.

The patient self-medicated with prednisone and did not seek medical care. Symptoms resolved later the same day they appeared. The patient indicated he had an appointment unrelated to this event scheduled with his primary care physician on March 3, 2021, and was advised to discuss the reaction with the physician at this appointment.

On 2/17 (three days after vaccination), he sought care in the emergency department for chest pain that worsened when he was supine and shortness of breath.   EKG in the emergency room showed STEMI and troponin levels were normal. He was transferred to a different facility for cardiac catheterization. Cath showed mild circumflex disease and a stent was placed. He was diagnosed with pericarditis at that time (elevated inflammatory markers ESR/CRP). He was discharged home post cath on Plavix/ASA.   He had an echocardiogram at his PCP?s office on 2/25, results still pending (as of 3/10).  2/25 ? televist with cardiologist who concurred with pericarditis, maybe mild coronary artery disease (follow-up scheduled 3/11).  3/3 chest pain symptom improved further, no cough, improved shortness of breath.      Medications at home: statin, previously colchine for gout, likely BP medication (PCP will send records)  Allergies: None known.  Vaccine Indication: Age &gt;75

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: CR2613), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Mar2021 (at the age of 77-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included broke femur of right leg on 09Nov2020 and hospitalized from 09Nov2020 until 15Nov2020 or 16Nov2020, surgery to repair broken right femur on 12Nov2020, rehabilitation following hospital discharge and got out of the rehab facility on 14Dec2020, been in either a walker or a wheelchair and still not fully recovered (ongoing); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma diagnosed at least 13-14 years ago,  bronchitis, all ongoing from an unspecified date diagnosed at least 13-14 years ago. Concomitant medications were not reported. There were no other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced a blood clot in the leg. The clinical course was follows: After he was discharged from rehab, the patient went to his own family doctor on 30Mar2021 because his ankle and leg were still swollen. The physician sent him to have a vascular done, on an unspecified date after 30Mar2021, with unknown results. The patient reported that the physician determined that he had blood clots in his leg. The patient was sent to the emergency room and started &#34;that stuff&#34; for about a week until he went to a regular vascular doctor and the physician determined what the patient should be doing. The patient reported that he was diagnosed with the blood clots after he got out of rehab. The patient received apixaban (ELIQUIS) from Apr2021 for blood clot in leg. The clinical outcome of blood clot in leg was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : PFIZER INC-2021478767 same patient, different dose/event

                                                A-fib; renal dysfunction; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in Mar2021 (at the age of 77-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included carbidopa and levodopa. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. In Mar2021, the patient experienced onset of A-fib and resultant renal dysfunction shortly after injection. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with Cardioversion and medical management for the event A-fib. The outcome of the events was recovered on unspecified date.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: As there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the events of Atrial Fibrillation and Renal Impairment and the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drug is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had a long period of Atrial fibrillation, my heart will stop for 8 seconds and then it will start again. I had like 3 or 4 fainting episodes. Since then, I have had a heart pacer implanted. They put a Halter monitor to check my heart behavior. I was already under treatment for the fibrillation but this was an exaggeration of this problem.  My cardiologist told me to come in because I had the monitor and they saw that my heart was stopping so I went in since it was an emergency. They kept me in the hospital for 3 days because they wanted to keep me in observation before they put the pace maker in.

                                                During my earlier years working in an industrial area I had inhaled asbestos which caused me to have plural thickening in my lungs. Every year since that diagnosis I have been required to annual Pulmanary (lung and heart) testing. On February 11th I had my 30th annual Pulmonary exam consisting of EKG, Stress Test, and Chest X-ray. As in the past, results were all good. On March 3rd I had my 1st Pfizer vaccination. Five days later on March 8th I collapsed, was taken to the hospital by ambulance having suffered a massive Pulmonary Embolism affecting my heart and right lung. During my 2 hour operation, Surgeons used a flexible suction tube inserted thru my groan to remove a large blood clot (embolectomy). Pieces totaling about 14cm long, 2cm wide and 1/2 cm thick. I was discharged 3 days later and instructed to take blood thinning medication probably for the rest of my life. I am now 78 years old.

                                                Patient had second dose of Pfizer vaccine in morning. That afternoon began complaining of abdominal pain with subsequent vomiting (x2) and possible diarrhea. Patient could not sleep that evening . Awoke next morning with continued abdominal pain throughout the day and ultimately was found unresponsive in bed. Transported to hospital where he was pronounced dead. Subsequently autopsy was performed which revealed significant pre-existing hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with evidence of acute myocardial infarction. There is no clear evidence that this is related to the vaccination, however it is being reported due to potential public health interest and temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                On March 2, he woke up feeling bad and had a fever of 102.7. He took tylenol and liquids all day and the fever came down to around 100. The next morning he woke up complaining of excruciating pain in his left arm (site of the injection). He couldn&#39;t stand to have anything touch it, couldn&#39;t move it and couldn&#39;t sleep because of the pain. The next morning he woke up very weak, wasn&#39;t able to speak clearly, wasn&#39;t making sense. He had a telemedicine appointment scheduled that morning for another matter. The doctor took one look at him and said we should have him evaluated asap. I took him to the emergency room at Hospital. They did some tests and said he was septic and immediately put him into the ICU.  He was started on IV antibiotics while the blood cultures were growing out.  It was determined that the bacteria was Strep G but they were unable to identify the source.  He was put on a ventilator and an echo cardiogram was done.  It was believed that the source of the infection was his pacemaker and I was told the pacemaker would have to be removed.  They couldn&#39;t do it at that hospital.  He was transferred to another hospital.  The doctors at that hospital determined the pacemaker was not the source.  It was believed by some doctors that the source of infection was the injection site.  The infection was cleared from his body and the ventilator was removed after 2 weeks.  He lived another 2 weeks but never was able to recover. Until the day he was put on paliative care, he expressed pain in the arm where he had received the vaccination.

                                                DVT was twice as bad; death/natural process; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse reporting for reporter&#39;s husband. A 78-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (reported as COVID vaccine), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 20Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as 2nd dose, single (at the age of 78-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes, Liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, Kidney stone, sarcoidosis, blood pressure abnormal, high cholesterol, pacemaker and they putted the IVC filter for blood clot. Concomitant medications included insulin, simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide and omeprazole (PROTONIX), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) on 27Feb2021 at the age of 78-year-old for COVID-19 immunization and experienced pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on 12Mar2021, and went into the hospital 12Mar2021. Then the patient had the second COVID shot on 20Mar2021 and the reporter had taken him right back into the hospital couple days later because the DVT got twice as worst. The patient experienced DVT was twice as bad on an unspecified date in Mar2021, which required hospitalization on 22Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests, he had lab tests on 22Mar2021 when he went in and he probably had them on 23rd and 24th of Mar2021. The reporter didn&#39;t know what all the lab tests were done in the hospital. The patient died on 12Apr2021. The reporter stated they put Reason of death as natural process because she sent him in the Hospice. An autopsy was not performed. The outcome of event DVT was unknown. The reporter considered there was a causal relationship, when he got his second COVID shot on 20Mar2021 and then he went back in the hospital on 22Mar2021 and the DVT was twice as bad.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a positive temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported DVT.

                                                difficulty breathing; pneumonia; human immunodeficiency virus; pain in arm, neck and back; pain in arm, neck and back; pain in arm, neck and back; FACILITATED COLLECT   This is a solicited report based on the information received by Pfizer from AbbVie Inc. (MFR Control No. # 21K-163-3841481-00). A non-contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself that a 78-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer, Batch/Lot number was not reported), intramuscular on 12Mar2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization; adalimumab (HUMIRA, Batch/Lot number was not reported, Solution for injection in pre-filled pen), subcutaneous from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, at unknown dose for moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced difficulty breathing on an unspecified date, pneumonia in Mar2021, pain in arm, neck and back in Mar2021, human immunodeficiency virus on an unspecified date. The events difficulty breathing and pneumonia were reported as serious per hospitalization, event human immunodeficiency virus was serious per medically significant. The patient took covid-19 vaccine and afterwards had pain in arm, neck and back and could not breathe. He went to emergency room and was hospitalized due to difficulty breathing and was diagnosed with pneumonia. He did not know if this was due to vaccine and would not be taking second vaccine shot per his primary physician. He also had human immunodeficiency virus. It was unknown if patient was enrolled in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. On 12Mar2021, patient received first dose COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer. The action taken in response to the events for adalimumab was unknown. The outcome of events for difficulty breathing was unknown, for other events was resolving. The reporter&#39;s causality for the event(s) of Pneumonia, Pain in arm, Human Immunodeficiency virus, Pain in Back and Pain in neck with adalimumab was no reasonable possibility. Causality for all events with COVID-19 vaccine was not reported.   The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of all events with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known disease pathophysiology, the  reported event of  Human Immunodeficiency virus , pneumonia  and dyspnea is assessed as not related to suspected product  bnt162b2 vaccine and  the events pneumonia  and dyspnea are more likely due to underlying medical condition of chronic plaque psoriasis. However the reported events of  Pain in extremities ,Pain in Back and Pain in neck is assessed as related due to close temporal association with the suspect product. However, more information is required on date of HIV infection deducted to properly assess the case. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit-risk profile of the Pfizer product and on the conduct of the study is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

After second shot, episodes averaged four per week for six weeks. I went to the ER April 4 and was referred to electrophysiologist. I saw electrophysiologist on April 15, he immediately scheduled me for double cardiac ablation. I had this procedure on May 7, whereupon my episodes ceased.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN6201; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 78-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, Liver cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, kidney stone, sarcoidosis, blood pressure (unspecified condition) and high cholesterol and a pacemaker (cardiac pacemaker insertion). Concomitant medications included insulin (manufacturer unknown), simvastatin (manufacturer unknown), hydrochlorothiazide (manufacturer unknown), carvedilol (COREG) taken for blood pressure, and omeprazole (PROTONIX).  On 12Mar2021, the patient developed pulmonary embolism and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) that requiring a hospitalization on 12Mar2021. The nurse reported, &#34;He went into the hospital 12Mar2021 that&#39;s when they find out he had pulmonary embolism and DVT. They putted the IVC filter for blood clot.&#34; On 12Mar2021, the patient was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism and DVT. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of pulmonary embolism and DVT. The clinical outcome of the events pulmonary embolism and DVT was unknown.  Additional information has been requested and will be provided as it becomes available.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported  pulmonary embolism and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) were causally related to BNT162b2 .  These are intercurrent  medical conditions.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Apr2021 as 2nd dose, single dose (at the age of 78-year-old) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 as 1st dose for COVID-19 immunization. On 02May2021 (26 days later), patient lost his vision while driving and it came back good enough to drive within a half hour (medically significant) and when it recovered on 02May2021, patient started seeing strange things, saw things that were not there. The yellow wall in his bedroom came up but had all kinds of artwork on it, the ceiling and doors too (medically significant), patient couldn&#39;t remember things, had weird things happened in his brain. Patient stated that it didn&#39;t go away entirely until about 10 days later. Patient also had issues with confusion as well. Patient stated that he thinks he was back to normal now. A computed tomography (CT) scan was completed a week or so earlier and it did show hardening of the arteries in his brain. Patient saw his primary care physician and was referred to a neurologist. On unspecified date of May-2021, patient was told he had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or some kind of a stroke (medically significant). Patient had a Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) (like a Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain) yesterday (27May2021), but it had not been read yet. Patient asked if he was the only one that had done this or had other people had this problem, even two or three people or he was an isolated case and in response it was stated that, unable to find information about his symptoms in resources and the Product Information (PI) for the vaccine does not contain information reporting his symptoms (vision loss, memory loss, confusion, hallucinations) as side effects of the vaccine. The outcome of had a TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) or some kind of a stroke was unknown, for lost his vision while driving was recovered on 02May2021 while recovered for rest of the events on May2021.

A 79-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 00:15 as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no COVID prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. Medical history included hypertension. The patient had no known allergies. Concomitant medications included atenolol, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. Historical vaccine includes first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on an unspecified date (at the age of 79-year-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient stated that in the past her pulse rate was in the low 60&#39;s. The patient lost energy gradually from 23Feb2021 until 26Feb2021 and 27Feb2021. The patient was completely down in bed with no energy. The patient had some aches on 25Feb2021 at 07:00 AM, but the pulse rate went up to 80 to 100. The patient went to the Cardiologist he believes on 08Mar2021 and was diagnosed as having atrial fibrillation (AFIB) on 08Mar2021. The patient was being treated for AFIB now and have been light headed and physically weak since 25Feb2021 at 07:00 AM. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of diagnosed as having afib. The patient had not yet recovered from the events.

He went to his PCP for follow-up and had a CT PE study today which was positive for right upper lobe and right lower lobe pulmonary embolism.  He notes that he received a 2nd 5 0 COVID-19 vaccination on March 6th and since then has not felt well, feeling short of breath and generally fatigued.  He notes that he has not been very active since receiving the vaccine.   CT PE study showed an increased RV to LV ratio 1.2.  He had no elevation in his troponin or BNP.  His echocardiogram showed an EF of 60% and there were no wall motion abnormalities and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. Patient would prefer Eliquis at this time.  He will need a 6 month course of Eliquis.  Given the setting of recent COVID vaccination and recent decreased mobility as possible provoking factors, this will be treated as a provoked pulmonary embolus.  Per hospital COVID vaccine protocol, patient presentation will be reported to pharmacy for FDA reporting.

                                                Developed fever, nausea and vomiting about 24 hours later. Symptoms lasted two days and began to subside, at which time shortness of breath began. Patient drove himself to the hospital for evaluation and treatment on Saturday, March 27th where he collapsed in cardiac arrest. he was resuscitated and stabilized on life support. He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

                                                history of hypertension, mild cognitive impairment.  Prior COVID pneumonia treated as an outpatient November 2020.  Completed dose 2 of Pfizer  vaccine  4/11 with progressive fatigue low-grade fevers and white count of 14 CRP elevated at 4 (see this would equate to a CRP of 40 with most other lab references) on 04/27.  He was admitted and treated for community-acquired pneumonia with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  He was discharged 04/30 and then presented again 5/5 with progressive right greater than left consolidative ground-glass opacities and hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring up to FiO2 80% of high-flow nasal cannula.  Infectious workup has been negative.  He has been too unstable to bronch.  COVID-19 testing has been negative.  He was started on high-dose steroids 5/8 with stability and slow gradual improvement.

Ongoing concomitant medications included tamsulosin taken for enlarged prostate; gabapentin taken for neuropathy; candesartan taken for hypertension; pravastatin taken for cholesterol; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN); and furosemide (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE]) taken for fluid retention. The patient has been taking all of his meds for quite some time, over 5 years. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 09Mar2021 10:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The patient completed the Pfizer COVID vaccine series, the second shot was on 30Mar2021. On 09Apr2021, the patient had an embolic stroke. The patient&#39;s daughter stated that the patient has a history of TIA in 2019 and was concerned. She does not know if it was related. She added it might be that if people have previous risk, there may be some precautions, like to take a full dose of aspirin before, a week before. She sent an e-mail last 05May2021 and hasn&#39;t gotten a response back. The patient went to the ER due to embolic stroke and was in the hospital Friday (09Apr2021) through Wednesday. The patient went to the stroke rehab center for 3 weeks. The daughter clarified that the patient was in the hospital until 14 or 15Apr2021 before being transferred (also reported as 5 or 6 days and in rehab for three weeks). Then was discharged last 06May2021. The patient&#39;s condition seemed to be getting better. His major issue was speech and wasn&#39;t able to formulate any words. He was able to speak now. His rehab would be a lot of neurological rehab and speech therapy. The patient previously had left sided weakness on his leg from some random thing that happened. It didn&#39;t seem to get worse. It really affected his speech and cognition. The patient&#39;s daughter thought that the embolic stroke was related to the Pfizer Covid vaccine and added that thought was in some way but cannot say in what way. She thought that it exacerbated some type of blood clotting. She stated that he never had blood clotting issues before and was the type of person that would take a baby aspirin and get a nose bleed, he was the opposite of a clotter. An MRI in the hospital showed blood clot and stroke. He had blood work but does not know what it showed and presumed he was fine (unknown results). He has never really had any kind of blood work issues and does not know why he was on cholesterol medication. The patient required emergency room visit for embolic stroke. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal relationship and known product safety profile, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the reported &#34;embolic stroke&#34; cannot be excluded. Previous medical history and Old age is a risk factor for the onset of stroke. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as  part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of  aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review,  as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient died 1/10/2021 from chronic respiratory failure and congestive heart failure after recent aspiration pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Death was anticipated and not sudden.  We were told to report his death to VAERS even though his death was anticipated and not related to his vaccination.

Pt and his son exited the building and when they got to the car, the pt shouted out &#34;oh no!&#34; and collapsed to the ground. The patient was unconscious experiencing agonal respirations, and unresponsive to painful stimuli. There is an Emergency Room at the same location. Their staff came out and helped to transfer the pt to the ED for further evaluation. It was found that the patient had a known  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm (7/28/2017) that seemed to have ruptured. The patient was stabilized and transported to our local hospital and upon arrival, he was effectively comatose with a GCS 3. CT Head notated an extensive subarachnoid and intraventricular hemorrhage most probably related to a bleeding anterior communicating artery aneurysm. Neuro-Interventional Radiologist dictation reads &#34;Hunt Hess 5 Fisher grade 4 extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage and early hydrocephalus secondary to rupture of a known anterior communicating artery aneurysm.  Initial ICP after EVD placement noted to be in the 120s now 68 treatment complicated by aneurysm rerupture after admission and increased volume of blood although large volume of hemorrhage was seen on initial scan and no change in the patient&#39;s clinical exam on her scale was noted due to this rerupture.  Patient&#39;s exam and prognosis are poor giving extensor posturing lack of extraocular movements to doll&#39;s maneuver and weak pupillary reflex as well as cough and gag.  Follows no commands or instructions at this time with no spontaneous movement on ventilator set at 12 overbreathing at 14-16 at this time without any sedation.&#34; The family opted to discontinue any further treatment to include surgical intervention given the findings. The patient was given comfort care with son and daughter at the bedside. The patient was extubated and expired at 1545h on 2/13/2021.

                                                STEMI; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. An 80-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscularly, administered in the left arm on 29Mar2021 13:30 (at the age of 80 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, chronic kidney disease (CKD) 3, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included tamsulosin, amlodipine, doxazosin mesilate (CARDURA), albuterol [salbutamol], umeclidinium bromide (INCRUSE ELLIPTA) atorvastatin (LIPITOR) and montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously took enalapril and augmentin [amoxicillin; clavulanic acid] and experienced allergies with both. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number and expiry date were not reported), intramuscularly, administered in the left arm on 05Mar2021 13:00 (at the age of 80 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on 31Mar2021. The event was reported to have resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization (also reported as number of days hospitalization: 0; pending clarification) and was reported as life threatening. Treatment included cardiac catheterization. There was no other vaccine in four weeks.  It was unknown if the patient had COVID prior vaccination and was not COVID tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event was recovering.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported event cannot be excluded.

The next day my husband complained about pain in his entire body and weakness, and I had the same.  In the evening he collapsed falling out of his wheelchair.  He tried for an hour to sit down back in his wheelchair with my help, but he couldn&#39;t.   He agreed that I call 911.  Two nurses took him to Emergency Room at Hospital and didn&#39;t allow me to go with him.  In the morning on Saturday, he was transferred to Room at Hospital and the next day to the Intensive Care Room, where he sadly passed away on Tuesday April 13 at 4:22 am.

Pt presented to hospital on 04/28 w/ complaints of nausea and vomiting. He stated that he had recently gotten his COVID vaccine. Pt was found to be in acute liver failure in the ED w/ AST and ALT &gt; 1000. Lactate &gt; 15.0. BMP showed AKI on CKD and BG &gt;500. Pt did have cardiac arrest while undergoing CT Scan and ROSC was achieved after CPR x 20 mins.  Pt was hence transferred to the ICU for higher level management and admitted for cardiac arrest and acute liver failure.   Upon arrival, Pt was intubated and sedated. He was non-responsive to verbal and physical stimuli. Pt was acidotic. ABG: 6.99 / 28 / 165 / 7. 1 amp of HCO3 was given upon arrival. Pt was started on insulin gtt for DKA and was started on Levophed for low BP.  Pt underwent cardiac arrest shortly after arrival to the ICU. CPR was performed for &gt; 20 mins without ROSC. Family arrived at bedside and decision was made to stop CPR at 0205 on 04/29/2021.

From H&amp;P &#34;He reports that he woke up this morning and then subsequently started developing left-sided chest discomfort, it was pleuritic in nature.  It is sometimes worse with position.  He traveled to the Emergency Room where he was found to be mildly hypoxemic.  He underwent workup to include a CT angiogram, which revealed multiple predominantly small peripheral bilateral pulmonary emboli with borderline dilation of the main pulmonary artery and slightly greater than 1:1 right to left ratio.  He subsequently was felt to be appropriate for admission because of his underlying hypoxemia.  He denies any unilateral weakness or stroke symptoms.  He does have a patent foramen ovale.  He also reports no history of calf discomfort.  With the exception of being sedentary because of the pandemic, he has not traveled anywhere in a car or in a plane in the last 6-12 weeks.&#34; treatment: enoxaparin 1mg/kg SQ Q12h starting 4/25 @1659, changed to apixaban 10 mg PO Q12h 4/26 at 1756.

                                                The medical investigator was contacted regarding the death of this 80 year old man within hours of receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19. Little information is known about the facility and actual vaccination administered at the time of this report. However, patient was reported by his next-of-kin to be an otherwise healthy 80 year old without COVID-19 symptoms. He did have a tobacco smoking history. By postmortem computed tomography scans, patient was found to have evidence of catastrophic complications of cardiovascular disease, with apparent aortic dissection and large blood collections in the left chest cavity as well as the pericardial sac. In my medical opinion, these findings were most consistent with a complication of his underlying cardiovascular disease.

Previous Right MCA stroke from 4/11 was fully worked up. The etiology of this stroke was cryptogenic. TSH from 4/11 was 2.57 and T4 was 0.69.  Hgb A1c on 4/11 was noted to be 5.6%. LDL on 4/11 was noted to be 73. MRI brain 4/11/2021 showed multifocal small acute infarcts in the right cerebral cortical/subcortical and periventricular matter infarcts, favored to be embolic. CTA head and neck from 4/11 showed no evidence of large vessel occlusion. Ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities on 4/12 was negative for DVT. ECHO on 4/12 was positive for PFO with an WF &gt; 55%, mild LVH and no thrombus. He also has an atrial septal aneurysm. Cardiac MRI was negative for thrombus. He was discharged on 4/14 with 30 day Holter monitor to evaluate for AFIB.

A 80-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection,Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included bypass surgery. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 16Jan2021, the patient experienced headache, minor aches, had a cough, muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, lethargic, chills and heart attack on an unspecified date. Caller states that on 14Jan2021 she and her husband had the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. 2nd dose was scheduled on 04Feb2021. Caller reporter that 2 days after the 1st dose, her husband&#39;s muscles were tightening, could hardly walk, had a cough, was lethargic, had chills and was c/o having reflux in his chest. Caller stated they had appointments that day with their Internist and their Cardiologist. Both HCPs felt all his symptoms were probably from the vaccine. That night she took him to the ER and he had had a heart attack. They did a cardiac Cath and had one of two stents put in. His kidneys were compromised and the HCP couldn&#39;t give the amount of dye needed to add another stent. So he still needs another stent. Also the blood count went down. Caller states her husband had cardiac bypass surgery years ago. The caller also mentioned her son is a surgeon and had bad flu like symptoms after second shot and only had a headache and minor aches after the first dose. She was concerned about her husband as he had a heart attack and if he should get the 2nd dose. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count: went down. Outcome of the events were unknown.  Upon follow-up on 16Apr2021: This follow-up is being submitted to notify that the lot/batch number is not available despite the follow-up attempts made. Follow-up attempts have been completed and no further information is expected.

Treatment team COVID-19 Principal problem Chronic anticoagulation  Persistent atrial fibrillation (CMS/HCC)  COVID-19  Confusion  Hypoxemia Hospital Course: In his hospital stay we managed his medical issues as follows;   Confusion/Syncope in the setting of COVID-19 infection Chronic atrial fibrillation/sinus node dysfunction Hypertension Prediabetes Patient received first dose of vaccination on 3/16 and afterwards started having muscle aches and body pains, later on found out to be having Covid 19&#43; test, he might be having Covid infection before vaccination as well and symptoms showed with vaccination.  On 3/24 he was found out to be having confusion, family called EMS.  They tried to debride patient on his feet and he collapsed for about 10 seconds.  He did mention that he usually get dizziness/lightheadedness upon standing from bed.  Although patient has a history of A. fib but remained rate controlled during hospital stay, we held his antihypertensives including HCTZ and ARBwhile continued his Eliquis.  I believe his syncope was likely due to dehydration with decreased oral intake in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 symptoms. Before discharge is blood pressure was rising so his ARB were restarted while decision regarding HCTZ will be made by primary care physician. In regard to his COVID-19 infection, initially was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen but his oxygen demand decreased rapidly and most of the time he remained room air, he was not showing any dyspnea, cough, fever or any other generalized symptoms of Covid 19 infection.  He did get plasma and remdesivir while inpatient, decision was made to discharge him on 3/26 as patient was symptom-free.  He also had received first dose of vaccination. I believe that he would need further remdesivir.  We will continue him on steroids for now after completion of dexamethasone for next 8 days he can recent resume his home medication of prednisone.

Patient denied history of DVT/PE. In the ED, CTA-PE showed bilateral pulmonary embolic disease and Ultrasound confirmed acute right lower extremity DVT. Patient was started on a heparin drip and then switched to enoxaparin 1 mg/kg every 12 hours per pulmonary. Hematology/Oncology was consulted and determined that acute bilateral PE likely provoked by recent vaccination with the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Patient was switched to rivaroxaban 20 mg daily prior to discharge for planned duration of 3 months.

                                                patient passed away after receiving the Covid vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse.  An 81-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), intramuscular  into the right arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization.  There was no medical history and no concomitant medications.  On 08Jan2021, the patient passed away after receiving the COVID vaccine.  The patient died on 08Jan2021.  An autopsy was not performed. Investigations indicate that unspecified labs were done, but nothing two weeks prior; no further details were provided. The patient received the first dose the day prior. The reporting nurse discussed it with the medical director, and he thought that he potentially passed away from the COVID vaccine. The relatedness of the event to the suspect vaccine was reported as related by the reporting nurse per The Agency.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up .; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information available, it is medically not possible to make meaningful causality assessment, it is unlikely the vaccine could have contributed to the death of the patient based on the known safety profile. However case will be reevaluated when additional information is received during the follow-up  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Stated that the patient passed away after receiving the Covid vaccine

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 18:00 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. He did fine right after, his arm wasn&#39;t sore, he felt fine. The next day he had nothing, no soreness, nothing, he felt great the next day. Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had his first vaccine dose on 04Jan, then 7 days later he was in the hospital with a really high eosinophils count and infiltrate in his lungs, they did a CAT scan, and he had pneumonia in there. Patient&#39;s wife said that he was in the hospital for three days for Pneumonia, and now he was out of the hospital and he was supposed to get his second dose of the vaccine on the 25th. She would like to know if her husband should have the second dose, since she didn&#39;t know if the pneumonia was caused from the vaccine for sure, it could be an allergic reaction for the vaccine since his count was 22.2 for absolute eosinophils and that was down now to 2.4. She would like to know if it was safe for him get the second dose. She said her husband was still coughing and she didn&#39;t know, she was afraid for him to get it. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included a CAT scan in Jan2021 and he had pneumonia in there , absolute eosinophils: 22.2 (Eosinophil count high) in Jan2021, absolute eosinophils: 2.4 in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Stroke; like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EL1283 and expiry date: 30Apr2021) solution for injection, intramuscular in left arm on 18Jan2021 13:10 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chicken pox, measles, and mumps (had chicken pox vaccine, measles, and mumps when he was younger, and he got the flu shot for flu). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The next day (19Jan2021) after receiving the injection, patient reported it was like he had a film over his eye, it was cloudy, like a cloudy day. This went on for a couple of days before it improved. There was still a little bit in his left eye, but he can read and it has improved. He can see now and his eyes were improving. He found out that he had a stroke on 28Jan2021. He did not go to the hospital. He does not think the stroke affected anything else. He was supposed to have an MRI sometime this week. He went to the eye doctor and the eye doctor was the one that discovered the stroke and his eye doctor sent the report over to his primary office. He had a vision field test which was how the stroke was diagnosed. He was taking a baby aspirin and he will be put on a blood thinner called Plavix. He has not started Plavix yet, he has to go pick it up. Outcome of the event stroke was unknown while the other events was recovering.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Sudden onset of Atrial Fibrillation within 2 minutes; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). This 81-years-old male patient received dose 2 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EN6206, on 05Mar2021 10:45 in right arm as a single dose (at the age of 81 years) for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient had dose 1 of BNT162B2 for COVID-19 immunization, Lot number EL9261, on 05Feb2021 10:45, in Left arm.  Relevant medical history included GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease).  There were no allergies reported. Concomitant medication included Omeprazole, Ursodiol, fexofenadine hydrochloride (Allegra), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (Benadryl).  The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient experienced sudden onset of Atrial Fibrillation within approximately 2 minutes on 05Mar2021 reported as 10:45. The patient was seen at the physician&#39;s office.  Treatment included EKG; Xeralto anticoagulant.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested post vaccination.  The outcome of sudden onset of Atrial Fibrillation was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event cannot be completely ruled out given the implied temporal association. However, underlying medical conditions may provide the alternate explanations. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Received voice message on 4/6 from daughter that client had died several hours after receiving vaccine.  Also reported he had underlying health issues so unsure of cause.  I made telephone call to daughter on 4/6.  Daughter was wanting report made and plans to do so with additional health information included.  I informed daughter I would be making a report also.

                                                On February 20, 2021 in the early evening my husband began to experience chest pain and pressure, took Tylenol, however did not relay the symptoms to me. About 6:50 AM on February 21, 2021 told me that he did not feel well, had chest pain and pressure in his chest. An ambulance was called and my husband was transported to the Hospital. I was contacted by the treating physician and was told that my husband suffered with a Pulmonary Embolysm (sp?). He was started on Heparin and admitted to the hospital. Later that evening his medication was changed to Eloquis. He was released from hospital the following evening. He has since followed up with his primary care.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine at on Monday, February 15. That evening, he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease.  He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes.

                                                Per the family: on Monday, February 15 he experienced visual disturbances with slightly blurred vision. Not thinking anything of it at the time, the vision cleared, and he continued about their evening/week without telling anyone of his visual disturbances. On Sunday, February 21, he experienced additional visual disturbances including double vision and dizziness, and we had him visit a local ER for evaluation. He was discharged with a diagnosis of dehydration and vertigo. No scans were performed. The visual disturbances cleared up the following week and the only persistent symptom was a slight dizziness. An eye exam was performed on Friday, February 26 with no problems found. An MRI was performed on March 3, and he was diagnosed with the below conditions.   Impression (3/3/2021) 1. Small acute to subacute infarcts in the left splenium of the corpus callosum and parasagittal left occipital lobe. 2. Trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the parasagittal left parietal lobe. 3. Mild chronic microvascular ischemic disease. He was admitted to the hospital and remained there until Saturday, March 6. Follow-up scans and testing were performed with no underlying reason for the stroke being determined. Prior to the stroke, he had been a very active individual with osteoarthritis as is only health complaint. He was not on any prescription medication prior to the stroke. While in the hospital, the tests for high blood pressure, high cholesterol (LDL 92 MG/DL), sugar inadequacies (glucose 93 mg/dl, A1C 5.7%), etc. came back without major concerns. His follow-up CT scans also did not reveal the stroke shown on the MRI. No inquiry was made by any of his doctors or hospital staff as to his COVID vaccination status/dates to even consider the connection. Below are the results of the last CT scans:  Impression (3/4/2021) 1. Age-related volume loss and white matter disease similar to prior exams. 2. Small infarct seen on MRI are not well seen on CT. 3. No acute intracranial abnormality demonstrated on the CT scan.  Impression (3/5/2021) 1. No evidence of acute infarct or intracranial hemorrhage. No significant change. 2. Periventricular white matter disease is likely secondary to chronic small vessel ischemic changes. Per daughter on 4/23/21 patient has improved significantly

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right shoulder on 23Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 81-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus, stage 3 renal failure (was not bad, was in stage 5 couple of years ago, was a month or so away from full failure, was in the hospital and had dialysis, was able to get reversed with medication and diet), high blood pressure, and blood cholesterol increased/high cholesterol. The reporter stated that with regards to patient&#39;s height, he shrunk a little. Patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, didn&#39;t get flu shots. Concomitant medications include about 12 other unspecified drugs, takes statins, has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Patient started experiencing pain behind his left knee about 6 or 7 days later in Mar2021 (also reported as 04 or 05Apr2021, pending clarification). By that Sunday, it had gotten worse. The leg swelled and was also having foot swelling because blood flow wasn&#39;t there. There was no TIA&#39;s no stroke, no heart racing, no sweating, was all pain. Got leg up and kept elevated until they could get to the doctor and get imaging. Patient went Monday 08Mar2021 to see the doctor. Patient was brought to the doctor and was then sent to the imaging place. Radiology read the imaging around 5:15pm on the Monday, 08Mar2021. The radiologist said there was 2.5&#34; blood clot behind the left knee. He had never had a blood clot before. Patient was then sent to the Emergency Room at (Name) Hospital, in (Name) where they live. Was kept there several hours. Did a lot more blood tests. He was immediately put on 10mg ELIQUIS 10mg, once in the morning, and once at night. He is now taking 5mg Eliquis in the morning, and 5mg at night. He has not had any of these problems before the Pfizer shot. The reporter knew that not a lot had been reported. It seemed it should be safe. The correlation and timing having the shot on 23Feb2021 and all of a sudden a week and a half later this happened. It was 10 days later. There was nothing they can do about it. Just continuing with the ELIQUIS, trying to dissolve the blood clot, will be staying on it for 4 to 6 months. It was a pretty big blood clot and were worried about it breaking up and traveling. The patient had no other symptoms, had a sore arm, that was it. Patient going back to (Name) 01Jun2021 and he will have another CT scan or ultra sound when they get back. The reporter did not want to need to get the leg amputated. Patient was only in the ER, was not admitted to the hospital. Patient was concerned because of his age. If it doesn&#39;t dissolve, they know there will be a lot more trouble. The event of pain left knee, blood clot and sore arm required a visit to the emergency room and physician&#39;s office. The patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 on 01Apr2021 (lot number: ER8730) in the right arm. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Patient developed chest pain late March.  Duration of 1-2 days.  No medical follow-up.  Patient developed chest pain and difficulty breathing 26 Apr.  He reported to a facility like Urgent Care.  HCP recommended CXR which revealed questionable findings.  HCP recommended hospital visit but patient did not go that day.  Instead patient called ambulance to home the next morning and was transferred to the local hospital. Chief complaint chest pain and difficulty breathing.  Bloodwork ruled out myocardial infarction.  Various other assessments done over the first three days of hospitalization, including a CT scan which purportedly showed about a pulmonary emboli.  Most (if not all) of the emboli were in the right lung and were small and fixed/immobile.  At least one was larger.   Patient was started on heparin .  Echocardiogram workup ruled out presence of DVT in the legs.  Patient was discharged after 13-14 days in the hospital.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included nasal swab: negative on 09Jan2021.  There was no treatment given for the event. The patient died on 11Jan2021.  An autopsy was not performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Lacking information on the cause of patient&#39;s demise, the Company cannot completely exclude a causal relationship between COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, and patient&#39;s death of unknown cause, as a cautionary measure and for reporting purposes. The patient&#39;s pre-existing medical condition of metabolic encephalopathy from, failure to thrive (FTT), diabetes mellitus (DM) 2 , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arthritis, weakness, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease (CKD), dementia may have provided the contribution to the event in this 82-year-old male patient.

                                                pulmonary embolism; Covid 19 PCR positive (Igg also positive) with chest x-ray consistent with Covid pneumonia, 2 weeks after 1st dose; Covid 19 PCR positive (Igg also positive) with chest x-ray consistent with Covid pneumonia, 2 weeks after 1st dose; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other healthcare professional. An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose, lot number and expiration date unknown, via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was admitted with pulmonary embolism and Covid 19 PCR positive (Igg also positive) with chest x-ray consistent with Covid pneumonia, 2 weeks after the 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided by the reporter, it appears unlikely that subject product contributed to the events. The reported events may likely represent intercurrent medical conditions.  Pulmonary embolism is known to be a potential complication of COVID 19 infection, including COVID 19 associated pneumonia.   There is limited information provided in this report. Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including pulmonary angiogram, VQ scan and coagulation panel, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This consumer reported the same events for himself and two other patients. This is the first of three cases.   An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 04Mar2021 and first dose on 27Jan2021 (batch/lot numbers not reported); both via unspecified routes of administration as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes. Concomitant medications were not specified and reported that they were too many to list, also he has quite a list of prescription. The patient stated since he has gotten both COVID shots and it was found out after going to the doctor and to a cardiologist that he was the third person that has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation from taking the COVID shots and since he was the third person that they had recently after both shots, he thought he should call the toll number and report side effects after taking the vaccine. Consumer confirmed the date for diagnosis of atrial fibrillation as 08Mar2021 and stated primary care doctor, he went for his quarterly visit and she gave him an EKG and it showed this the fibrillation and he was immediately sent to a cardiologist who confirmed it after a second EKG and echocardiogram had both of those. Consumer stated it said atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy and mixed hyperlipidemia whatever that was, he has a print out of the diagnosis from the cardiologist in his hand. Consumer stated date of test was yesterday, 08Mar2021. Consumer stated he was given a new medicine Eliquis 5 mg twice a day as treatment. Consumer stated he just wanted to report this, since the doctor yesterday told him that he was the third patient that had both shots and came back with this. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                After my father received the second COVID vaccination he started complaining of headaches.   He had lung cancer, but he was in good condition.   Within weeks his health deteriorated and when we bought him for a scan the beginning of March he had two small brain bleeds.   The cancer had spread to the brain and he had a mass.    They put a shunt in on March 18th because they said he had fluid, and this was the only treatment.   Ten days later he was back in the hospital and after a week we had to take him home on hospice.   I think the vaccine could of escalated his cancer this rapidly.  Especially because he had two brain bleeds.

ER work-up concerning for severe sepsis with acute hypoxic respiratory failure for which he was admitted to the PCU under the hospitalist service.   Hospital Course He was treated with dexamethasone and remdesivir but remained hypoxic requiring alternating trials of high flow nasal cannula and BiPAP for which pulmonology was consulted on 5/12.  Unfortunately, he did not tolerate prone positioning.  Despite his advanced age and several risk factors, he slowly but surely progressed from a pulmonary standpoint.  He was weaned off high flow oxygen 2 days ago and deemed stable for downgrade to MedSurg with telemetry at that time.  Since then he has continued to recover well, now requiring 6 L of oxygen with activity and 4 L at all other times.  He is anxious to be discharged home and appears medically stable to do so with home health care services, remote patient monitoring and outpatient pulmonology follow-up with PAL as prior to hospitalization.  Prior to discharge, all questions were answered and patient and his son expressed understanding, appreciation and agreement with the discharge plan at this time.   Treatments: IV hydration, analgesia: acetaminophen, cardiac meds: metoprolol, furosemide and aldactone, anticoagulation: eliquis, steroids: dexamethasone, respiratory therapy: O2 and remdesivir

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A male patient of an unspecified age received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dementia and he shrunk he is 5&#39;9&#34; or 5&#39;8&#34;. Concomitant medication(s) included warfarin sodium (COUMADIN), at 4 mg once daily in the evening 6 days per week, On Fridays he takes 6 mg once in the evening. Patient&#39;s wife says her husband had one vaccination, the Pfizer vaccine and a week later her ended up in the hospital. They had to postpone his second dose because he ended up in the hospital but they have the second one coming up on the 14May2021 and she is scared for him to get it, he is adamant he is going to take it. He was taking her to the doctor for a problem she had and he told her he could not go to the bathroom and she was like what, because he has a stoma bag and she looked and it was plugged with a blood clot, he couldn&#39;t open it and drain it so she told him to get in the shower and take it off and put a new one on and she was pulling it off, it was full of blood and there was a big huge, like real liver sized clot came out of his stoma bag.

She thinks he was admitted to the hospital on 12Apr2021 and he got the first dose the week before that. She thinks it was 12Apr2021 that he was admitted because it was just before birthday first dose week prior to that. They never made the connection.

                                                Cardiac arrest Narrative:  An 82 year old, male, resident of a facility, received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 12/30/20 (time of dose not known). On 12/31/20, patient was reported to be febrile with increased lethargy and UTI was suspected so patient received a dose of ceftriaxone and levofloxacin. Within 30 minutes he became wheezy and short of breath, developed hives and tongue swelling. He required intubation and admission for treatment of acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and significant lactic acidosis. Treatment included epinephrine, H1 and H2 blockers, and steroids. He recovered and was extubated on 1/3/21 and discharged back to the facility on 1/6/21. Attending physician noted that antibiotics were most likely contributor to event, but recommended that patient not receive the 2nd COVID vaccine dose. Patient was referred to an allergist to assess this event, with an outpatient visit on 1/14/21. Patient expressed interest in receiving the 2nd dose. Allergist determined that the antibiotics were the cause of anaphylaxis, and recommended skin testing to take place 6 weeks after his reaction. Allergist determined the reaction was not due to the COVID vaccine and advised patient that he could receive the 2nd dose. Patient received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 1/9/21 (time not known). Notes from the facility indicate patient was lethargic and running a fever the morning of 1/20/21. At 1500 on 1/20/21 patient was noted to be lying supine in bed, visiting with aides. At 1508 nurse entered room and noted patient to be lying on floor supine and nurse was unable to get patient to respond to shaking or calling his name. Breathing was noted to be labored, and nurse was unable to detect a pulse. At 1509, 911 was called and CPR initiated. Spontaneous pulse and breathes resumed just before ambulance arrived at 1522. On arrival at the ED patient was responsive and breathing spontaneously, however, hemodynamically unstable. Patient went into cardiac arrest and code blue called at 1535. Received treatment with epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, amiodarone, atropine. Patient was intubated. EKG obtained and showed acute MI. At 1622 he again went into cardiac arrest and time of death was called.

Patient was admitted to facility on 7/12/20 after he was found down in his home for 3 days, dx with right MCA ischemic stroke with hemorrhagic conversion. Etiology of CVA was presumed to be secondary to AF/warfarin failure. No treatment with tPA or thrombectomy was initiated as he was outside the window for intervention. Patient was also found to have bilateral DVTs. Patient was then admitted to facility 08/14/20 for end of life care.

A contactable physician (anesthesiologist) reported that an 83-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Mar2021, the patient developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after getting or receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The physician would like to know the protocol of that. The patient got his vaccination, on Thursday before the reporting (25Mar2021). And the patient was admitted to the hospital 48 hours later on Saturday (27Mar2021) with acute bleeding and thrombocytopenia. The patient went to the hospital with uncontrollable bleeding that did not stop. The physician was interested if the company had any internal protocol for treatment of ITP occurring acute onset after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The physician was trying to get some information to help some rheumatologist who can&#39;t seem to be finding things on the information on treating this. The physician was not here to blame anybody for it and from what he/she read, there are like 150 cases around the world with thrombocytopenia after the COVID-19 vaccine from totally different manufacturers (further clarification unknown). The physician had read a many couple case reports of different individual, people have tried for that but he/she was just interested if the company had any inhouse information for the treatment protocols for acute thrombocytopenia after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Immune thrombocytopenic purpura. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified.

An 83-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), intramuscular administered on arm left on 08Feb2021 08:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9269; Expiration Date: 02Feb2021) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing atrial fibrillation (AFib) and he had maybe once or twice a week but never felt it (before Pfizer shot), ongoing hypertension, and Meniere&#39;s disease which had attacks several times a year  and since he lost his hearing in his right ear the attacks were minor (he felt a little nauseous, similar to having a minor hang over and with a louder than normal ringing in his right ear -tinnitus). Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for atrial fibrillation from 2016 (reported as 5 years ago) and ongoing; and hydrochlorothiazide (HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE) taken for hypertension from 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) and ongoing. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination nor tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient didn&#39;t receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Before the shots, he had an AFib attack maybe once or twice a week never felt it. He mentioned that the only way he knew he had it was using his fitness watch and take his pulse before several times a day (unknown results) and before he exercise (he will not exercise if he was in Afib  but it always went away overnight). His doctor recommends staying hydrated and will see a cardiologist if it does not stabilize. After his first vaccine shot on 21Jan2021  06:45 (Batch/Lot Number: EK9231) intramuscular administered on arm left and while he was at his car, the was in Afib which lasted for 5 days (26Jan2021) which was unprecedented. After about five days, his pulse stabilized and was back to normal having AFib again maybe only once a week (AER 2021194945). Then, the patient received the 2nd dose on 08Feb2021.  By 08:45, the patient was in AFib again for five days (13Feb2021) when it cleared but then it came back almost immediately for another two days and he was not back to normal even after 7 days. The patient also had Meniere&#39;s attack the same time (08Feb2021 08:45) with the Afib he had.

Uncomplicated alcohol dependence (HCC) 05/05/2021 Yes   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None   DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY:   PRESENTING PROBLEM: Patient is a 83 y.o. male with Hx of HTN who presents today with complaint of right sided flank pain, with radiations into the right side of his back and right side of his chest. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration. He denies palpitations and shortness of breath. He has no previous HX of VTE. He denies fever, chills, cough, nasal congestion, and sore throat. He denies abdominal pain, N/V, and changes in bowel movements. The patient is a limited historian. He is oriented x4 on admission, but states that he has had difficulty with his memory over the past 2-3 years. He lives alone in an apartment.   In the emergency department the patient&#39;s vital signs were stable.  Labs revealed a potassium of 3.3.  AST was 52 and ALT 61. White blood cell count was 11.13.  Troponin was negative and BNP was within normal limits.  Lactic acid was 1.5.  UA showed trace blood.  EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with PACs.  CTA the thorax abdomen and pelvis showed acute pulmonary emboli involving the segmental subsegmental arteries of the upper and lower lobes.  There is no evidence of heart strain. He was admitted for observation due to severe pain, and was given IV fentanyl.  Echocardiogram showed: The left ventricular ejection fraction is 67%. No regional wall motion abnormalities noted. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. The estimated right ventricular systolic pressure is 36 mmHg. The inferior vena cava was not visualized during the exam. There is no comparison study available.    He was started on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for total of 3 months.  He should follow up with PCP in 1 week and should check CBC and BMP on 5/10/21. He should also follow up with pulmonologist in 2-3 months.  He had Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 2/18/21 and 3/18/21. There is remote possibility that this PE could be related to COVID-19 vaccine, so this was reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). He had mild hypokalemia due to HCTZ, and required K-dur supplement. HCTZ was switched to Maxzide 25/37.5 mg daily. Rechecked K was normal 3.9. BMP should be checked in 1 week. Also he is drinking little bit too much alcohol, 4 alcoholic drinks every night. He was instructed to cut alcohol drinking to &lt;/=2 alcoholic drink a day.  His daughter was updated over the phone.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

                                                No adverse effects for the first two weeks.  The morning of 2/7/21 he claimed he was not able to sleep the night before.  He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

On his way into the Vaccination Center, he was blown over by high winds sustaining a blow to his right forehead with small abrasion and a 3x4cm subcutaneous hematoma. He  was assisted to a wheel chair and brought into the EMT booth for further assessment. He was awake and alert and oriented during his time with us. He never lost consciousness . He vigorously requested to receive the Covid-19 vaccination which we complied with. Due to the mechanism  of injury and use of an anticoagulant, he was subsequently transfered to Hospital for further assessment and care. We heard on 4/3/21 of his death.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose at the age of 85-years-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 15Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing diabetes mellitus, cancer removed from his buttocks (It was either a basal or a squamous and they did not feel it was bad and they had removed it all) on an unspecified date, he has had a stent put in on an unknown date, Had surgery for a valve replacement on an unknown date, heart disorder (He is on a lot of medications) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 85-years-old on 24Feb2021 and experienced he was tired a little bit. After the second dose on 15Mar2021 her husband and her were extremely exhausted, not sleepy, just tired. They were told to expect that though. He was extremely exhausted and this began soon after the COVID vaccine fairly early in the day. Her and her husband came home soon afterwards and looked at each other and said that they were tired and it was not sleepiness, it was not like they needed a nap. It was profound tiredness and exhaustion. Her husband had it more so but they were both in bed for a couple hours. Neither had pain in the injection site though. This lasted for several hours into the evening. Adds that for her husband 1st dose he did not have any effects basically but for his 2nd dose he did have the weariness, not sleepiness, just a tired feeling for several hours. He was just resting and he was also in the hospital but it was for another event not because of the COVID vaccine. She says that it was frightening, he went to the doctor for a routine check up he has had a stent put in and had surgery for a valve replacement at the beginning of the year and also he has had a cancer removed from his buttocks at the beginning of the year. But during his regular check in they did his hemoglobin and it had dropped to 6.1 on 20May2021, and the doctor said that they were going to call an ambulance and her husband said he was going to drive to the hospital since he was only 2 to 3 minutes from there. They admitted him and he was in for 3 days. They can not find the bleed site and they did an endoscopy and they are waiting for him to have an outpatient colonoscopy. They can not figure out the bleed and where it is coming from. He is currently been resting but it is frightening because it was out of the blue. Caller confirms that the stent, cancer and the valve replacement were all prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was hospitalized for hemoglobin and it had dropped to 6.1 (haemoglobin decreased) and bleed from 20May2021 to 22May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included endoscopy: unknown results on May2021, haemoglobin: 6.1 on 20May2021. The patient recovered from fatigue on 15Mar2021 while the outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021595342 same patient, and vaccine, similar event, first dose

                                                Patient started to become progressively weaker within 3-4 days after getting vaccine. Family members became concerned and started taking him to doctor -- primary and oncologist and cardiologist -- they ordered multiple tests and could find nothing. No sign of cancer which had been in remission for months. Patient became progressively weaker over the next 2 weeks, was hospitalized, became unable to get out of bed; hospice was called, and he died May 13. No explanation could be offered by his doctors.

An 86-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration at left upper arm on 08Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation (AFib) and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient was taking loads of medications. The patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and reported that he had no problems with the first dose. The patient experienced severe left arm pain at the arm where the shot was given on 08Mar2021, the night after he received his second COVID vaccine dose. He almost called a number because he thought he was having a heart attack. What he did was he got up to walk around and the pain went away and when he sat down on his recliner, the pain came back so he didn&#39;t get much sleep that night. He was fine the next day. The patient took an ASPIRIN 325 mg coated pill because he thought he might be having a heart attack. If he had known, he would have taken the vaccine on his right arm. His arm hurt the night of 08Mar2021 until 6:00 AM the following day. The patient then stated that his recommendation was to tell the people who are administering the shot that a left arm pain may possibly occur because anybody who has the left arm hurting is afraid and can think they have a heart attack. The outcome of the event pain in arm was recovered on 09Mar2021 at 06:00 AM, and recovered on 09Mar2021 for all other events.

This was felt by the treating physicians to be most likely not related to or associated with the vaccine, but given the close proximity it was asked that this be reported.

Mental cognitive ability was unchanged, and he seemed to still be sharp. Up until the day of death, the patient was still active, able to drive, speak, make jokes, eat, and do everything normally. The morning of death, he had a bad fall, but couldn&#39;t recall what happened. It&#39;s assumed that a low blood pressure event, syncope, partial aneurysm, something of that nature causing temporary loss of consciousness occurred. We attended a funeral that afternoon, ate lunch, and dropped him off at his home. Sometime during that evening, he fell and died. The cause is unknown and still &#34;undetermined&#34; on the death certificate. (Heart attack or brain aneurysm is what I&#39;m guessing)

                                                On Sunday afternoon, March 14, I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccination. On the morning of March 16 I had a sudden hit of fatigued and my left leg started going numb while doing some menial work in the yard, The numbness cleared when I went inside and laid down but some form of the fatigue persisted for several days. Then, on March 28, two weeks after the vaccine, I woke up to a leg severely swollen from toe to hip. I waited two days to see if it went down but it only got worse, swelling to double the size by volume. I went to the doctor and they sent me to the hospital for ultrasound, suspecting a blood clot. No blood clot was evident but there were multi swollen limp nodes in the upper leg area. The problem worsened and two days later I was sent in for a CTscan which now showed multi blood clots near the swollen limp nodes. I was barely able to walk as major pain persisted with no signs of decline. I am now on blood thinner. It has been 2 months since the vacination and my leg is still swollen the same amount (2X by volume).

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.  He had another episode of lethargy/unresponsiveness on 2/26/2021 and was once again sent to the hospital where they did not show any new findings.  He spent a few days in the hospital before returning to his facility where he continued to have periodic episodes of increased lethargy/confusion and decreased eating.  He was placed on Hospice and passed away on March 29th.

An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in 10Jan2021 at 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination. The patient received one dose of Pfizer vaccine on 10Jan2021. The patient was presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan2021. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb2021 from respiratory failure from COVID19. It was unknown if autopsy was done. The patient was tested for COVID post vaccination via nasal swab: covid-19 virus test positive on 27Jan2021. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, and patient died.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported COVID post vaccination and respiratory failure with fatal outcome, and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association.  More information on the underlying medical condition in this 89-year-old male patient is required for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from respiratory failure from COVID19; presented to the ER with COVID symptoms and was diagnosed on 27Jan. Patient subsequently died on 09Feb from

                                                He died around 5 o clock; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). An 89-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 12Mar2021 13:00 at a single dose (lot number was reported as NEEU200, the reporter did not know if its 2 or Z) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history allergic to Penicillin, has a long list of allergies, neck pain and sleep disorder (sleep aid). Concomitant medications included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), clopidogrel bisulfate, calcitriol, melatonin (MELATONIN) taken for sleep aid, Phillips Laxative tablet Magnesium (not appropriately paraphrased and clarified, as reported), simvastatin, terazosin hydrochloride, tizanidine hydrochloride (TIZANIDINE HCL) for when he had the pain in neck (he didn&#39;t take that hardly ever), vitamin C [ascorbic acid] and Multivitamin one a day. On Friday 12Mar2021, the reporter and the patient went to get the Covid shot. Their appointment was at 12:30 but they were in line long time before they got the shot. They got the shot around 13:00 and then they have to wait 15 minutes before they could leave. They drove up, they were ready to shoot us with the needle and they asked the patient, asked was he allergic to anything and the reporter answered for him and said yes, Penicillin and other long list and then they gave him the shot. They never did go over his allergies. They got home about 13:30, so which would take us about that long to get home. The patient died around 5 o clock and the reporter didn&#39;t know if this was connected or not with his death. The patient died on 12Mar2021. It was not reported if an autopsy was performed.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: This case of death was provided with minimal details and autopsy results not available. However, drug causality cannot be completely excluded for BNT162B2 injection, only due to plausible chronological relation. Otherwise, information received was so limited to prevent a thorough medical assessment for patient death. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer drugs is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: He died around 5 o clock

The next morning at approximately 11:00 am, the reporter found patient laying on the floor next to his bed, eyes glazed over, disoriented, and he said &#34;he felt funny&#34;. The reporter got him sitting up leaning on the side of the bed and called. The EMT&#39;s came and checked his vitals. Within half an hour from  finding the patient laying on the floor, he seemed almost back to normal. However, since he is 89 years old, the patient was transported by ambulance. Blood was drawn, a urine sample was taken, a chest Xray, and a CT scan of his head and his spine were the labs that were run. All the labs came back normal. However, once patient got home after being in the ER for 5 hours, he is very weak, can barely stand and barely walk without human assistance and his walker. The way he is acting is more like he had a stroke. Onset of the events reported as 20Mar2021 11:15 AM. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The patient used walker due to can barely stand and barely walk; for other events, there was no treatment given.
