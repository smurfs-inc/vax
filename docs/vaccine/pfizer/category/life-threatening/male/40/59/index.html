                                                Patient received 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA at 2:04pm , &lt;5 minutes after vaccine administration he developed hypotension with loss of consciousness for few seconds. He was sitting in a designated chair for the protocol 15 min observation and fell from the chair to the ground, hitting the right side of his temporal - redness noted around area with skin intact. Clinic staff immediately moved patient to be lying down on the ground with cervical spine precaution and lifted his legs up on a chair. Vitals: HR 78 and BP 118/72 taken in supine position on ground with legs elevated. Patient was transported by EMS to the ED at 2:45pm. ED note: Patient has Hx of vasovagal syncope in the past with similar symptoms after blood draws..Exam and workup shows well-appearing young man, nonfocal neuro exam, normal gait, cardiopulmonary exam unremarkable, no signs of trauma other than a small hematoma to the right forehead. After evaluation, their Canadian Syncope Risk Score is -3 indicating very low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (&lt;1%). Telemetry monitoring during their ED stay has not captured any events. Discussed next steps with patient: given their low risk for 30 day serious adverse events (including death, serious arrhythmia, MI, PE, ICH), they would prefer to be discharged to continue their workup as an outpatient, rather than admission for observation. Patient was deemed stable to discharged from the ED at 5:57pm with counseling to follow up with PCP in the next 2 days and to return to the ED with any persistent or worsening symptoms.

                                                Tonic clonic seizure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced tonic clonic seizure on 01Feb2021, the same day. The patient received the dose at 14:00 and had the seizure around 19:00. Patient has recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported tonic clonic seizure and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

When I went to see that patient, he was laying on the floor with his eyes rolled in the back of his head and was unresponsive. He was not alert. He started having a mild seizure and I rolled him over on his left side. While I was bracing the patient, pharmacist came in and administered an Epi-pen to his left thigh. Patient stopped seizing so I rolled him back on his back. He became alert and was able to provide me his name, DOB and what he was at the pharmacy for. I rested my hand under his head and monitored his pulse until the paramedics arrived

I ended up checking myself into the emergency room 5 hours after the vaccine shot because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t slow down and my blood pressure increased. They found out my heart had gone into atrial fibrillation. I have had no known history of atrial fibrillation in the past and prior EKG&#39;s at physicals have been normal.   I am an otherwise healthy individual.The doctor conducted an emergency  Cardioversion to return the heart rhythm to normal.

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

A minute or two after that both my hands went numb, then both my arms went numb.  I asked others around me if anyone felt anything and everyone else was fine.  A minute or two after that both my legs went numb. I started to black out but made it to a chair before this happened,  I drank some cold water and felt awake about 5 minutes later.  30 minutes after that i felt comfortable enough to walk.  For the rest of the day i felt like i was legally drunk and felt lots of pins and needles on the back of my hands and feet. I did not feel dizzy or nauseous at that time. i also felt a lot of pressure on the inside of my skin all over my body. I&#39;ve never felt anything like that and it was a bit uncomfortable.  The next day i was too dizzy to walk without becoming very nauseous.  I still had pins and needles on my feet. i had chills as well which i guess is a good sign.  my appetite was fine. i felt clear-headed as well.  Two days after the shot i felt slightly dizzy and by the third day i felt fine except for minor muscle cramps all over my body.  For the three days after the shot i also had some pretty strong forearm and calf muscle cramps and my arms (biceps and triceps) felt pumped up like i just had a great arm workout, but they weren&#39;t swollen at all.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                anaphylaxis; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable healthcare professional (patient himself). A 43-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced anaphylaxis in Jan2021. The outcome of the event was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation and known safety profile of suspect drug. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took pain killers and did not subside and that end up going to hospital emergency . I was diagnosed with 2 blood clots in left leg  . I do not have family history of clots nor any h/o major medical issues . All my previous and recent blood reports normal . I am currently in use of blood thinners

No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                massive heart attack; knee pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Mar2021 12:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack in 2019, heart disorder (Heart),  Blood cholesterol abnormal (cholesterol), hurt his knee at work prior and torn meniscus. Concomitant medications included ongoing ticagrelor (BRILINTA) for the heart; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and ongoing carvedilol (COREG) for the heart. The patient previously took clopidogrel (PLAVIX) for heart attack. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 and suffered a massive heart attack on the same day. After the event, his cardiologist reviewed video from the heart catherization to open the blockage and the cardiologist indicated that the area that was obstructed with this heart attack had not been obstructed 2 months ago. The cardiologist believed that the COVID 19 vaccine is the culprit in causing the massive heart attack. The cardiologist believed the area of the blockage was too dramatic. The cardiologist encouraged the caller to report the event and the cardiologist will offer his expertise in this matter if needed. The patient also tried to report to his local health department but is waiting on a call back from them. He reported that he had a heart attack in 2019. He was taking Plavix but after this heart attack his cardiologist has changed some of his medications. He reported he believes his medications were changed at his follow up visit with the cardiologist on 23Mar2021. He reported that he had continuous blood work done while in the hospital. They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

                                                syncopal episode; mild seizure activity; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional. A 43-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Ew0161) at the age of 43-years-old, intramuscular in left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. He has no COVID prior to vaccination and denied being allergic to anything. There was no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks. The patient received his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in a workplace clinic on 20Apr2021 and experienced syncopal episode with mild seizure activity at 11:15, within the 15-minute period post vaccination (as reported). No treatment was given in response to the events. It was unknown if the patient was tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. However, the information provided is very limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment. Case will be  reassessed if additional information is received. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

He syncopized and struck his head on a concrete stair. He was immediately seen by provider who was at a nearby table. The patient regained consciousness within moments without any evidence of post ictal confusion. He suffered a laceration to the head. Bleeding was controlled, EMS was contacted expiditiously, and the patient ambulated from the building approximatelyh 20 minutes later and was brought by EMS to the nearest emergency department to be evaluated.

The patient requested a chair to sit down and the Paramedic assisted the patient to do so. The patient expressed verbally to the Paramedic having a difficulty with needles and subsequently the patient lost consciousness while on the chair but maintaining a pulse and a hoarse respiration (snoring). Thereafter the patient was placed on a medical code in supine position with an immediate clearing of hoarse respiration. Evaluation by the Paramedic revealed an intact HEENT, (continued on page 2)...

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

The seizure resulted in a fractured vertebra (T12).  On 4/5, while resting at home I woke up and had another seizure sitting in a relax the back chair.    I had a mri on my brain that I understand came back normal.  The doctors aren?t sure what caused the seizures but increased my dosage by 500 mgs per day despite my previous dosage controlling my seizures for about 5 years prior to my vaccine.   No doctor has definitively stated the seizures were caused by the vaccine.  However, the timing has prompted me to notify you of these events.

Fever, cough, shortness of breath, coming and going. It lingered until Tuesday, at which time he got a Covid test- negative. Went to dr, and he said there was a possibility of blood clots. Tests showed that he had severe pulmonary embolisms in both lungs- the main and 3 secondary arteries.

Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

A 46-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose (at the age of 46 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient has no medical history. Concomitant medications included aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid] (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  Since his stoke, he is doing better. He completely lost mobility on the left side of his body. His mobility on the left side of his body is slowly coming back. His job is in jeopardy. The doctors told him that there is no guarantee that he will regain full mobility. They did not give him a patient record card. If they did give him one, he left it at the house. He has been in the hospital ever since his stroke. They put him on blood thinners after his stroke. Whenever he was in the ambulance, he did not have high blood pressure. They were able to catch his stroke quick. They found they clot, but could not extract it from what he understood. Adverse events reqiored Emergency Room.  The patient was hospitalized on 01Apr2021. The outcome of clot was unknown and other events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccine I became overwhelmingly tired. Went to get ready for bed by first going into the bathroom. While getting ready I passed out (micturation syncope). Hit my head on the floor and sustained a concussion. I am still experiencing post concussive symptoms but this is to be expected as it has been less than a week.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

This 47-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sleep apnea; high blood pressure; high cholesterol; borderline diabetes. Concomitant medications included losartan; alirocumab (PRALUENT, injection) on 20Jan2021. Since 23Jan2021, patient was dizzy all along and almost fainted and was still having symptoms of mild migraine and he don&#39;t know like some light sensitivity. Doctor believed it was from vaccine. Patient was wondering how long was this going to be last as he had second shot coming out. He didn&#39;t think it was an adverse reaction and he thought he should get the second shot. But this was continuing to me and it had already been two weeks and patient still having symptoms of mild migraine. Patient was worried about taking the second shot as a result. He had never had a migraine before and was told it was probably from the vaccine and that was not something he wanted to hear. Patient wanted to know if this was normal to still be having this side effect for this long. Patient was taking acetaminophen (for migraine), it was not a TYLENOL, it was from a different brand. Patient did liver and cholesterol test and blood test in Jan2021 at Cardiologist and they came back fine, nothing was found there. The outcome of event migraine was not resolved. The outcome of rest events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

The patient took the Tylenol and his fever came down a bit and the patient went to sleep. On the next day, 17Mar2021, the patient&#39;s neck pain started going up more like a headache. On the morning of Thursday, 18Mar2021, the patient got weak. The patient could barely move his hand or neck or leg. After the weakness began, &#34;it was like 1-2-3&#34; and the patient was passed out.

                                                The night after my first shot, I felt pressure on my lungs, It felt as if I had the onset of Pleurisy as I have had that issue in the past.  I figure I would wait to get it treated as it is not always picked up in the x-ray in its infant stages (based on past experience).  On March 2, the pain became unbearable and I went into a urgent care center to get an x-ray and something to help with my issue.  The urgent care did not take my x-ray they immediately sent me to the hospital strongly intimating that the problem was probably more serious than I thought.  I was in the emergency room, they ran tests and made me comfortable enough as they also gave me a ct-scan which is when they found the bi-lateral pulmonary embolisms.  I have since gone to my primary care physician and he directed me to a hematologist/oncologist.  The event was found to be unprovoked.  I am on blood thinners for 6 months.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Dose 1) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 20Mar2021 18:15 (batch/lot number: ER2613 and expiry date unknown) at 49 years old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at the Hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history included obesity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Patient had no previous heart issues and had no known allergies. There were no concomitant medications or other medications in two weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 21Mar2021, 12:00 am, patient went into atrial fibrillation with a high heart rate up to 160 bpm. It was reported that the heightened heart rate started on evening after the vaccine (on 20Mar2021), it topped out at a resting heart rate of over 160 bpm. Patient went to a primary health care physician, he did EKG (results unknown), then ordered patient to Emergency Room (Hospital name). The patient was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation with RVR. The patient was prescribed Apixaban (Eliquis) 5 mg oral tablet, 1 tab 2 times a day and Metoprolol (metoprolol succinate 50 mg extended release) 50 mg 1 cap per day. Patient was also given Diltiazem 10 mg via IV push while at the hospital. It was reported that patient continued to have increased heart rate and have not returned to a normal sinus rhythm as of 23Mar2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included EKG: unknown result on Mar2021; heart rate: heightened (topped out at a resting heart rate of over 160 bpm ) on 20Mar2021, up to 160 (high /bpm) on 21Mar2021 and heart rate: continued to have increased on 23Mar2021; and sinus rhythm: have not returned to normal  on 23Mar2021. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, and patient was hospitalized for one day.

Pt is a smoker, HTN and dyslipidemia. I was just informed a patient received the Pfizer vaccine yesterday @ 1129. Arrived to ER @1700 with a STEMI. He went for a heart cath yesterday and CABG this morning. Per the cath report his LAD was occluded.  I believe he was more aware of his symptoms after receiving the vaccine and that is why he finally came in.

A 49-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199 and expiration date not provided) intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 16Mar2021 13:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no relevant medical history. Family history included diabetes (mother). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200 and expiration date not provided) Injected intramuscularly in left upper arm on 23Feb2021, 13:30 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced DVT symptoms, soft tissue injury, muscle pull and ankle strain. The patient experienced DVT left lower extremity and bilateral pulmonary emboli on 23Apr2021. The patient called regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He had adverse events to report. He has a DVT on his left calf, which he later clarified was left lower extremity. He is currently on double dose of apixaban (ELIQUIS) since Friday. He finally went and got it looked at. He is still being treated and will be seeing a hematologist. He stated that DVT symptoms occurred after first dose and was undiagnosed. He treated it as soft tissue injury and thought it was a muscle pull and ankle strain. Eliquis was started on 23Apr2021 and dose is 5 mg. He is taking two tablets twice daily for 7 days and then 1, 5mg tablet bid (twice a day) as well. No emergency room or physician&#39;s office required but Urgent care facility was visited on 23Apr2021. During this visit, they did Lab work, D Dimer results 1590 on 23Apr2021; Venous Doppler resulted in positive DVT in Left Lower Extremity. Chest CT resulted in positive peripheral defects in small branches of the lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than right, consistent with Pulmonary Emboli. Left sided pleural effusion and left basillary infiltrate, possibly atelectasis or developing infarct. Few pleural based nodular densities at right lung base, again atelectasis versus developing infarcts. The rest just states what was normal. Eliquis was prescribed on 23Apr2021, 5 mg two tablets twice daily for 7 days, then regular dose times 7 days. He is to report to hematologist on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was unknown. The reporter assessed the events as serious (life-threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events DVT of legs and Pulmonary embolism cannot be totally excluded.

A 49-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 23Feb2021 at 13:30 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6200) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included a family history of diabetes - his mother had diabetes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. DVT symptoms occurred in Feb2021 after the first dose and was undiagnosed. He treated it as soft tissue injury and thought it was a muscle pull and ankle strain. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                He felt very bad the night he received the 2nd shot of Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on April 27. He even joked he probably would die that night. He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing. Within 2 months, he has lost 47 lbs and eats all the time and is still losing weight. He was about 200 something and was kind of built and now is skin and bones. He lost 6 (lbs) pounds within a week and is eating like crazy. Sensory nerves are all gone. If hit with a baseball bat and he would not feel it. It came on slowly almost that he did not know it was happening. That is why they want to send him to Privacy for a research center and he does not want to go. He never had this happen before. ER or physician&#39;s office required: 1st date was on Thursday, 11Feb2021, when he went to Privacy. He was having chest pain and hurting all over. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was released. The patient stated he wanted to change the information he had provided since he was not in his right mind since he had taken the wrong medication dose than the doctor had given him. He stated the medication dosage he wanted to change was for Amiripyin. He stated he wanted to say he told the representative the symptoms he had experienced was enhanced which they were yesterday because he was trying to fight everything and stay awake. COVID 19 vaccine: he stated the doctor did not want him to take the second dose of the vaccine. He stated one of the symptoms he had experienced after the vaccine that he wanted to change the outcome for is the neuropathy. He stated he is back to where he used to be and yesterday it was bad he could hardly walk or talk. He stated also the other symptoms he wanted to change the outcome for is the autoimmune. The patient has not recovered from neuropathy, autoimmune disorder, disoriented, can&#39;t walk or lift anything, chest pain, and sensory nerves all gone; while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Within 24 hours I had another heart attack. I was sent to another hospital for an Angiogram where they expected to find blockage and prepared to install a stint. They found no blockage. There is no medical explination.

                                                At about 2am on 2/10/21, Patient got up from bed and fell down a flight of stairs. He was initially bleeding and unconscious and was brought by EMS to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital he had a temperature of 40 C. He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program. He was seen by his PCP and had no abnormal findings. He had a CBC, BMP and CXR and all were unremarkable.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Following vaccination, patient felt achy and mildly feverish. During the night, he got up to use the restroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness, which persisted during the morning. A colleague at work evaluated the patient&#39;s pulse, noting it to be irregular and fast, so patient went to the ED for evaluation. EKG was performed and patient was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation. Patient was given fluid boluses, 10mg IV diltiazem, and a diltiazem infusion, during which the patient converted to normal sinus rhythm. After stabilization, he was discharged with new prescriptions for metoprolol tartrate 25mg BID and apixaban 5mg BID, to follow up with cardiology.

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM).

He woke up and ate a bit but not much and then was kind of pale. The patient then started to vomit, which continued throughout the night. He was having trouble in breathing. Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting. The patient was told he was probably having a reaction to the vaccine, but he was just dried up. The patient continued to vomit throughout the day and then he was very agitated again and would fall asleep for may be 15-20 minutes. When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

I did not have trouble breathing or swallowing. Very similar to what has happened to me sometimes getting blood drawn but happens at time of appointment not after.  Reclined, deep breaths and started to feel better within 10 minutes.  An hour later feeling much better.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 54-year-old male patient received the second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EP6955), via intramuscular route of administration on 09Apr2021 at 17:45 (at the age of 54 years) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included stroke/heart attack from 2014 to an unknown date. Concomitant medications included omeprazole (PROTONIX [OMEPRAZOLE]); atorvastatin calcium (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM]); levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHYROXINE [LEVOTHYROXINE SODIUM]); amlodipine besilate, benazepril hydrochloride (AMLODIPINE BENAZEPRIL); citalopram; and clopidogrel. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP6955) on 19Mar2021 (age: 54 years) in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown if patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Patient had no known allergies. On 09Apr2021 at 18:00, after second vaccine was given, patient passed out. His wife was with him. He came to but continued to drift in and out of conscientiousness. His BP was very low, pulse ox 99. He also had chest tightness. Ambulance was called. He was stable till ambulance came and took him to hospital. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care and hospitalization. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included IV fluids, Tylenol and something was placed under his tongue for chest tightness. The patient had COVID test on an unspecified date with unknown results. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                had pulmonary embolism in both lungs; blood clots/blood clots in the lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm right on 07Apr2021 at vaccination age of 54 years old (Lot Number: EN6208; Expiration Date: Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There was no medical history.  No known allergies.  No Covid prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left on 08Mar2021 14:00 at vaccination age of 54 years old (Lot Number: EN6205; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. No other vaccine in four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced had pulmonary embolism in both lungs on 17Apr2021 13:00, blood clots/blood clots in the lungs on 17Apr2021 13:00.  Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability or permanent damage. The patient had pulmonary embolism in both lungs. He was in the hospital for 3 days and now he will have to take blood thinners in definitely. He was admitted 17Apr2021 and discharged home 19Apr2021. He did not have history of blood clots and zero risk factors. Two doctors blamed the vaccine. He did not want to take blood thinners forever. He needed help figuring out how to determine if this was related to the vaccine. He had a reaction to the second shot and he had been in the hospital the last 3 days and the 2 different doctors that saw him said the only thing that was different was that he had received the COVID vaccine. He had blood clots in both of his lungs, he was in serious condition for a couple days there but his biggest concern now was that they were telling him that he will have to take medication forever to thin his blood because they didn&#39;t think there was a genetic reason it happened and that was the protocol that healthcare providers have to follow. They were telling him that he might contact a hematologist and do a blood study but they said they were certain that it came from the vaccine because there was no history of this in his family or himself. He said the condition&#39;s medical term was pulmonary embolism but he just said blood clots in the lungs because he thought he would make it easier to explain. Both doctors that saw him felt it was brought on the by the vaccine. He was not looking to sue or anything, he didn&#39;t want to be taking a blood thinner for the rest of life. He was not doing this for any reason other than to get well. He realized this situation was very rare with Pfizer, it was like 4 in 1 million with Pfizer according to his physicians. Covid tested post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 17Apr2021 with negative result. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of had pulmonary embolism in both lungs, blood clots/blood clots in the lungs. The outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

                                                had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die.; Syncopal episode; My platelets counts drop; metallic taste; Potassium level went down; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248) first dose on 12Feb2021 on Deltoid Left at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Covid-19 and High cholesterol. Concomitant medications were not reported. He said that he was 60 days post COVID and his doctor advised him to get vaccinated. He was feeling fine, but after 10 minutes into the shot, he had a metallic taste in the mouth. After 12-13 minutes, he had a feeling of impending death and thought he was gonna die. It freaked him out. He was rushed to the ER and had a complete blood count (CBC) and Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) test run on him. It was that his Potassium level went down to 3.3 and his platelets dropped to 141. He had tests on 28Jan2021 and mentioned that his Potassium levels were normal and had a platelet count of 181. He mentioned that there was no other way but the vaccine that could have caused this. He is if he would already have passed away from the shot from his opinion. Patient had a Syncopal episode of some type. He had an intended feeling like he was going to die after the shot, he was 60 days post Covid when he get that shot, he was getting over Covid and he was 60 days and he didn&#39;t wait the 90 days his primary doctor care told me that he can get it too because he was feeling better which he was feeling better but since then he have gotten that shot, he went to the doctor on the 28Jan2021 and he had CBC drawn on him and he went for his regular physical and Covid follow-up at his doctor, his platelets counts drop since he have had shot struck at 40 points, feels concerning. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported &#34;feeling of impending death and Syncopal episode &#34; and the administration of COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                anaphylaxis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified),  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Dec2020 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and amoxicillin, clavulanic acid (AUGMENTIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 18Mar2021 at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), AV Nodal block, and pacemaker. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Mar2021 20:00, the patient experienced anaphylaxis. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days on an unspecified date due to the event. The patient reported that he was on augmentin on and off for years and when he got his first vaccine. And on 18Mar2021, he began augmentin again and had anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. The patient was asking if this was related to the vaccine, but seems to be a possibility. The event resulted in resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The event was treated with epinephrine, steroids, benadryl, and fluids. There was no other vaccine in 4 weeks and patient had not had Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The action taken in response to the event for amoxicillin, clavulanic acid was unknown. Outcome of event was recovered in 2021.  Information on batch/lot number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the event anaphylaxis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event occurred more than 3 months after the administration of vaccine and can be attributed to augmentin based on provided information, including close temporal relationship and positive rechallenge.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic. Glucose 117 mg/dl (79-115 normal range), zinc 54 mcg/dl (60-120 normal range), CMV IGG AB &gt;10 u/mL (positive is &gt; or = 0.7 range). The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Pulmonary embolism in his left lung; Chills; Hard to breathe; shaking a lot; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EW0164) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 55-years-old) as a single dose in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from an unspecified date and ongoing and urinary tract infection (UTI) from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: first letter is either a G or O but he thought it was OE8732) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Mar2021 at 11:45 (at the age of 55-years-old) as a single dose in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunisation. Illness at vaccination was UTI.  On 20Apr2021 the patient experienced pulmonary embolism in his left lung, chills, hard to breathe and shaking a lot. The patient was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism in his left lung (blood clot) from 20Apr2021 to 26Apr2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated that he had the second Pfizer shot on 19Apr2021 and on the 20Apr2021 he had a really bad reaction to it. He had chills, it was hard to breath, he was shaking a lot and had a UTI and COPD and had to call an ambulance to come get him. When he went to the emergency room, they did a CT (computerized tomography) scan of his chest and found a pulmonary embolism in his left lung and he was put on a Heparin drip for 7 days and stayed in the hospital for 7 days. The event hard to breathe ended shortly after he got to the emergency room since he was on oxygen. The patient had a history of COPD, so sometimes he had trouble breathing, but right now he did not. The event shaking a lot ended a little after he got to the emergency room. The patient also stated that he had a history of UTI in the past and had a UTI during the vaccine but was not treated for the UTI until he was at the hospital. The clinical outcomes of the event pulmonary embolism in his left lung was unknown; chills, hard to breathe and shaking a lot were all recovered/resolved on 20Apr2021.

I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

Patient reported that he was going to get lightheaded as he normally gets this way with vaccines or blood draw. Patient never passed out; however, he almost fell when getting up from the vaccine chair, he reports lightheadedness and requested to lay down on the ground and have his feet elevated. Oxygen was brought to patient by post observation and 2 Liters delivered maintaining 99% saturation. After approximately six minutes, patient decided to get up from the ground. Two staff including patient?s wife assisted him to stand however, patient requested to be seated for a while. Patient was then moved to post observation where he was conscious, speaking clearly and monitored for an additional 30 minutes with no further incident.

                                                Blood clot/very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf; Joint pain; chills; he can&#39;t even walk now; leg pain; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 57 years; as reported) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.

The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 28Dec2020 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had a stroke on 01Feb2021 at 15:00. The event resulted to  emergency room/department visit and physician office visit but was not given any treatment (as reported). The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 27 days. The event was considered serious, life threatening, and disabling/incapacitating. Patient&#39;s nasal swab test on an unspecified date was negative. The outcome of stroke was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on know n drug profile  it is unlikely that the reported cerebrovascular accident was causally  related to  BNT162B2.  This is probably an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product and on the conduct of the study are evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                He collapsed with left sided hemiparesis; Stroke; Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect.; Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect.; Low platelets, 114; His bp as high as 200s/100; Hand weakness; Myalgia; Fever; Severe fatigue; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                Syncope episode; Lightheaded; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable nurse. A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscularly on 19Mar2021 at 13:00 (01:00 PM) (Batch/Lot Number: ep6955) at the age of 58-years-old as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. There was no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history and patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced lightheaded/syncope episode on 19Mar2021 at 13:15 (01:15 PM). The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of the suspect drug in the reported event syncope episode cannot be completely ruled out given the known suspect drug profile and/or implied temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regul atory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I woke at 6:30am on 04/07/2021 in a state of complete confusion and disorientation.  It was a level of disorientation I have never experienced before in my lifetime.  I fainted one time and was having extreme difficulty getting my bearings and walking and was simply in total &#34;mental disarray&#34;.  I was having difficulty producing words, a prolonged stutter, you might say.  I was shaking.  The local paramedics came and I was taken to the local ER.  Because I was having difficulty speaking, the paramedics (and later the physicians) thought I might have had a TIA.  An MRI on 04/07/2021 at 5pm produced a negative result.  So i can only attribute my reaction to the vaccine.  It was very significant, and i thought it made sense to report it.

The patient did not have COVID test post vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. After taking the vaccine the patient waited for 15 minutes prior to departing the facility in order to make sure there was no adverse reactions. At approximately 10:15 10:30 AM the patient drove back home. After driving for about five minutes while stopped at a traffic light the patient completely passed out at 10:45, he was unconscious for approximately 2 to 3 minutes, almost crashed his car and EMT support had to be called. The patient regained his conscience but it took him over a half hour to feel 50% better. Until 8:30 PM 26Mar2021, the patient still felt weak and dizzy and not normal. No treatment was received for events. The outcome of events was recovering.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). He reported that he doesn&#39;t usually get vaccines. BNT162B2 second dose (lot number: ER5729) was administered on an unspecified date; anatomical location: left arm. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Approximately 60 seconds prior to emergency, patient felt a sense of panic (first time ever).  Stated to me (wife) &#34;I feel like I am having a panic attack&#34; as we walked on to a parking garage elevator at 12:30 pm on 1.22.21.  As I turned to push the button to go down, leaned against the wall of the elevator. His eyes fluttered and back, he was a little pale.  When I turned around, again, he fainted and fell face down on the elevator floor.  He never stopped breathing and had no convulsions.  He was out for less than 30 seconds. When he came to, he got up by himself with minimal assist from me (911 was already on their way).  He did not remember saying that he felt like he was having a panic attack; but he remember the fear/panic he felt just prior to.  He was oriented x3.  I had him smile, stick his tongue out and speak to make sure it was not a TIA or stroke and there were no symptoms of that.  His bladder did release.  He went by ambulance to the ER (we were on a mini vacation to celebrate his birthday). They did a CAT scan, checked his blood sugar twice, EKG twice, complete blood work panels and urinalysis  All tests were either normal or negative.  They found nothing.  His BP was normal for the first 30 minutes at the hospital, then increased.  But has been normal ever since (he checks it daily). Absolutely no other symptoms since that episode.  He met with our PCP on 1.29.21 as a follow-up and she directed us to complete this form. She has ordered a consult with a Neurologist and that is scheduled for 3.10.21.  His second shot for the vaccine is due on 2.9.21.

At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down st.  On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

                                                I have had a weekly routine of fasting one day a week for the last 20 years. Sometimes I would extend this to 3 days, water only. I am healthy, 6&#39;1&#34; weight 170-180 all of my adult life. Resting HR &lt;56. 9 days after having my first vaccination, I did a 24 hour fast. I woke at 2 am to go to the bathroom. I became lightheaded and passed out while standing over the toilet. I layed on the floor for over 5 minutes with my head spinning. I then realized I was hypoglycemic. I have never had this issue. I took some orange juice and recovered my strength. I hit my head on the top of the toilet which required my to have 5 sutures in my chin at the ER that night.  Today I was working out for 30 minutes on an elliptical. I work out 4 to 5 times weekly.  10 minutes after returning to my room I noticed I was dizzy and checked my pulse from my watch. My HR was 210. this lasted for over 10 minutes. I have never had this issue.   I believe it would not be in my best interest to take the second vaccination.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

A 59-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Lot number not provided), via an unknown route, on 24Mar2021 (at the age of 59-year-old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperlipidemia (HLD). The patient did not have history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and no other risk factors. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 before vaccination. No relevant concomitant medications were provided. She developed left lower extremity DVT 24 hours after vaccine, on 25Mar2021. The event required emergency room visit. The patient was treated with an anticoagulation therapy. Post vaccination COVID-19 test was not done. The outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, the event deep vein thrombosis was most likely due to the patient&#39;s underlying hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia.

                                                Because patient had a severe adverse reaction to the first injection, he stated to me that he would not be getting the second injection.  Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732) at the age of 59-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. He has no known allergies and has COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, rosuvastatin, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. There were no other vaccines in four weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he was having some wild effects from the vaccine and did not know what to do. On 26Mar2021 at 15:00, he was having neuropathy like effects. His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.
