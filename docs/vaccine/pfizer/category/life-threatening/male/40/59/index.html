                                                Patient with PMH of depression and GERD who presented 1/8 with constipation, abdominal discomfort and worsening dyspnea. Symptoms began around 12/29. COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

Severe fatigue and constant fever as high as 105 for three days, and finally went to the ER. Immediately treated for sepsis. Full blood panel, blood cultures, x-ray and CT scan. Also ran some additional cultures for respiratory  pathogens. The Dr?s had a tough time determining what it was. They saw a very small area which they called pneumonia, however, I?ve had pneumonia and this was not what it was. Final discharge paperwork stated Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

                                                Tonic clonic seizure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced tonic clonic seizure on 01Feb2021, the same day. The patient received the dose at 14:00 and had the seizure around 19:00. Patient has recovered from the event on an unspecified date. No treatment was received for the event.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported tonic clonic seizure and the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

He is a Service Member and reported  high levels of baseline activity, including running 10 miles each Saturday. He received vaccine #1 25 JAN 21 (EN5318) without AE. He received dose #2 on 16 FEB 21, (EN6200). He experienced no immediate symptoms suggestive of IgE event. On day 1 he reports feeling cold, mild fatigue but no other symptoms. On day 2 he was baseline. On day 3 he noted numbness, tightness  and discomfort to his right  calf. On day 4 (Saturday), his usual long run day, he experienced dyspnea and lightheadedness after running 20-30 feet. He states he noted tightness in his calf and instead walked the track while his wife completed her run. He rested day 5.  Day 6 he noted significant edema to his calf, which he describes as double normal in size, and iced it. Day 7, he tried to schedule with PCP and based on triage was sent to ER. ER diagnosed R DVT and bilateral PE&#39;s. He was admitted overnight, started anticoagulation therapy. He saw hematology, and the workup was negative for other causes.

                                                The 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine was injected on May 3rd, 2021 at a clinic. Minor arm ache, fatigue, fever/chills felt for approx. ~1day post vaccination and then felt back to normal. Around day 3 post vaccination felt sudden, sharp, stabbing pain within chest cavity which forced me to take shallow, rapid breaths to avoid triggering pain. Lasted a few minutes before subsiding. Following day or so pain returned as a dull, diffused pain and was felt intermittently for several weeks. Generally I run fairly often for fitness, however activity level was reduced due the ongoing chest pain. Wanted to resume normal activity levels, but decided to consult a Doctor for peace of mind due to pain taking so long to resolve. Scheduled virtual appointment (06/24/21) who advised an ER visit due to it being a potentially risky chest issue, and the fact that they could run the appropriate tests to diagnose it relatively quickly. Walked over to a nearby ER that afternoon and was hospitalized for 1 night, who diagnosed an &#34;Unprovoked VTE&#34; with a &#34;Pulmonary Embolism&#34; in Right lung. Was treated with Lovenox injections at hospital and currently taking Eliquis medication.  As a side note:  my brother (43yrs old) who lives in another country, was administered the 1st dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine on 05/24/2021 and subsequently fell ill, went to the ER twice and was eventually diagnosed with VTE/Bilateral PE. He is also currently taking Eliquis medication.

On Tuesday, March 30, 2021 my entire leg swelled  to twice its normal size at which time I went to the emergency room and a blood clot was diagnosed in my right leg. I completed a multitude of tests and bloodwork with a hematologist and there are no factors or reasons they can identify as to why I developed a blood clot.

I ended up checking myself into the emergency room 5 hours after the vaccine shot because my heart rate wouldn&#39;t slow down and my blood pressure increased. They found out my heart had gone into atrial fibrillation. I have had no known history of atrial fibrillation in the past and prior EKG&#39;s at physicals have been normal.   I am an otherwise healthy individual.The doctor conducted an emergency  Cardioversion to return the heart rhythm to normal.

                                                Pt was found in severe distress in the bathroom by his wife.  He couldn&#39;t walk or stand, complained of being dizzy with slurred speech and was throwing up a lot. 911 was immediately called. The EMTs during their assessment said his BP was normal but when he was asked his name, he started saying the alphabet&#34;ABC... XYZ&#34;.  He was transported by ambulance to ER. Cat scan showed he had a bleed on the brain.  The doctors told us it was because he had very high blood pressure, however where the bleed was, they said he wouldn&#39;t need surgery and that the body would reabsorb it over time.  He was admitted to the ICU and has been there ever since.  Several days later, he started having difficulty breathing and they discovered several blood clots in his right leg that had broken off into his heart and lungs.  He had emergency surgery to remove the clots in his heart (approximately 10) and was given heparin in small doses over an 8 hour period so that it wouldn&#39;t cause the bleed in his brain to increase.  The doctor should fill in the rest.

They released me and the next day I developed Heavy pains. On 27 April I woke up and went back to the  hospital. They said I had elevated enzyme levels when they drew blood and they started three iv?s. They said I was having a non emergency heart attack. They had me transferred  by ambulance to the another Hospital. They drew more blood and did elf?s and ultra sounds. The next day they said they were going  to put a stint in my heart. The next day I was prepped for the procedure and they went in and said my heart didn?t need it. The surgeon said I had Myocarditis and at 7:00 pm that night I was released.  My nose broke out with acne bumps and it feels like I have a chest cold and cough.

Pt states that after receiving his 2nd dose on 05/06, he noticed his leg stiffness got significantly worse. He tells me that he tried to &#34;push through the pain&#34; and mow his lawn but had to stop d/t severe cramping of the LLE and pelvis. He states he rested his leg and went to bed, and when he woke up he noticed that his left leg was severely swollen. Pt decided to take 3 days off work to continue to rest the leg, but ultimately came in for evaluation at the suggestion of his coworkers. Pt denies fever, chills, chest pain, or SOB. He denies history of smoking, prior clotting, long car travel, air travel, leg injury, or recent surgery.    On exam, the left lower extremity is significantly swollen, erythematous, and hot to the touch. Physical exam otherwise unremarkable. Will admit to the hospitalist service for further medical management.   ED Course: Hypertensive with BP 170/93. Initial workup significant for WBC 13, K 3.3, glucose 159. CT chest/a/p with findings suggestive of multiple PE&#39;s of the left and right lower lobes as well as extensive LLE DVT extending slightly into the IVC. Trop &lt;0.03. BNP 66.

When asked when the pulmonary embolism began she says the week before the hospitalization, so the week he actually got the first dose, he was complaining of the back of his leg hurting, in the upper calf area. She says it was either the day after the shot or the next day that he said his leg hurt but he did not think too much about it and it resolved after a couple days and then Wednesday, 05 May 2021 he started getting discomfort in his left upper quadrant, she clarifies his abdomen and rib cage area, and he started having really bad headaches Thursday that continued and during the night  Thursday night his left shoulder started bothering him and it was radiating from his shoulder up to his chin as well as he had the severe headache so the doctor told him to go to the ER.

                                                This is not very clear that the Pfizer vaccine is actually the cause of the patient&#39;s Cerebral thrombosis, however, we are reporting to VAERS as this is a unique first case where the patient has Dural venous thrombosis within 2 weeks period of getting 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. 05/25/2021: CT HEAD/BRAIN W/ IV CONTRAST showed dural venous sinus thrombosis involving the superior sagittal sinus, right transverse, and sigmoid sinuses, extending into the proximal right internal jugular vein.

                                                I had an acute anaphylactic reaction to a yellow jacket sting.  Within 20 minutes of the sting, my whole body was swollen and airways began to constrict.  I received epinephrine, type 1 and 2 antihistamines, and steroids, and the symptoms resolved.  I am reporting this because I was stung by a yellow jacket in the same location a year earlier (pre-vaccine) and had no reaction.  I had never had an anaphylactic reaction.  Clearly, other factors could have caused the new response to what appears to be the same stimulus, but receiving an MRNA vaccine designed to stimulate immune response seems like a suspect worth investigating.

Vital signs were assessed by a Registered Nurse and a Physician. Oxygen saturation was noted to be 88% on 2 liters of O2 by nasal cannula. Verbal order received at 10:03am from Physician and EpiPen administered to right thigh with improvement of symptoms. She was transferred to the Emergency Department (ED) via stretcher. In the ED, she was re-dosed with an EpiPen secondary to her airway type symptoms. She was reevaluated after 15 minutes and received Solu-Medrol, Pepcid, Benadryl IV, as well as IV fluids. She also received Ativan for her generalized jitteriness and anxiety. She improved and felt significantly better at approximately 11:43am. She was monitored for 3 hours in the ED and was discharged home at 3:34pm in good clinical condition and advised to continue to take Benadryl as needed. She carries and EpiPen on her person and was advised to return immediately if symptoms return.

A 43-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced anaphylaxis in Jan2021. The outcome of the event was unknown.   No follow up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation and known safety profile of suspect drug. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient reports he has noticed over the past week increased shortness of breath on exertion--at baseline able to exercise with walking 45-60 minutes without dyspnea, however noticed over the last week getting some shortness of breath even walking to the garage. No chest pain, no fevers, chills, cough. He saw his PCP for these symptoms who ordered EKG and CXR 1 day PTA which per patient were normal--plan was for referral to cardiologist. However on the morning on presentation around 6:45 AM after taking an elevator for work he began feeling lightheaded and lost consciousness, awakening on the floor. He went home as he was not feeling well however proceeded to have another 2-3 episodes of loss of consciousness at home witnessed by his girlfriend--the later 2 occurred while lying down and were not clearly associated with any presyncopal symptoms.

                                                massive heart attack; knee pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 43-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6206 and expiration date not provided) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 12Mar2021 12:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included heart attack in 2019, heart disorder (Heart),  Blood cholesterol abnormal (cholesterol), hurt his knee at work prior and torn meniscus. Concomitant medications included ongoing ticagrelor (BRILINTA) for the heart; ongoing atorvastatin for cholesterol and ongoing carvedilol (COREG) for the heart. The patient previously took clopidogrel (PLAVIX) for heart attack. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No adverse events following prior vaccinations. The patient called about the COVID 19 vaccine. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine on 12Mar2021 and suffered a massive heart attack on the same day. After the event, his cardiologist reviewed video from the heart catherization to open the blockage and the cardiologist indicated that the area that was obstructed with this heart attack had not been obstructed 2 months ago. The cardiologist believed that the COVID 19 vaccine is the culprit in causing the massive heart attack. The cardiologist believed the area of the blockage was too dramatic. The cardiologist encouraged the caller to report the event and the cardiologist will offer his expertise in this matter if needed. The patient also tried to report to his local health department but is waiting on a call back from them. He reported that he had a heart attack in 2019. He was taking Plavix but after this heart attack his cardiologist has changed some of his medications. He reported he believes his medications were changed at his follow up visit with the cardiologist on 23Mar2021. He reported that he had continuous blood work done while in the hospital. They were monitoring his troponin levels. He also had a chest X-Ray, EKG and after the heart attack he had an echocardiogram to monitor the extent of the damage caused by the heart attack. He clarified that he did go to the emergency department on 12Mar2021, the same day he received the Covid 19 vaccine, but for knee pain. He received a pain relief injection of fentanyl that day. He had hurt his knee at work prior. He had previously had an MRI of his knee that showed a torn meniscus. He does not believe his knee pain on 12Mar2021 is related to the Covid 19 vaccine as he had already had an MRI that showed a torn meniscus. He had gone to the emergency department for pain management of his knee. He thought he would be given a lower strength pain medication but received Fentanyl. While the patient was at the emergency room for his knee, he suffered a massive heart attack. The patient clarified that he went to the emergency department because of pre-existing knee pain and while at the emergency department caller suffered a massive heart attack. The patient was hospitalized for massive heart attack from 12Mar2021 to 18Mar2021. The outcome of the event heart attack was recovering while the outcome of the event knee pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal association between BNT162B2 and the massive heart attack cannot be completely excluded. The knee pain was assessed as an intercurrent condition and is unrelated to BNT162B2.

A 44-years-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 19Feb2021 17:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation at hospital. Medical history included coronary artery disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on unknown date for covid-19 immunisation. The patient did not have covid before vaccination. The patient experienced small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. These events were serious as life threatening, disability and requiring hospitalization from 21Feb2021 till 23Feb2021 at 14:00. On 20Feb2021 07:00 the patient experienced headache, chill, running nose, shortness of breath with outcome of recovering. The patient experienced also pains in chest on 21Feb2021 11:00 with outcome of recovering and injection location had redness, hardness on an unspecified date with outcome of recovering. Clinical course was as follows. 19Feb2021-5:45pm the patient went to receive vaccine shot. 20Feb2021 the patient had headache, chill, runny nose, and shortness of breath. 21Feb2021 11am still had shortness of breath and pains in chest. Went to clinic had a rapid Covid test come back negative, pain increased and he went to emergency room. The patient was admitted to the hospital with small heart attack and myocardial/paracardial issues. Inflammatory response seems to possibly triggered possible underlying issue of minor heart disease. Then induced heart attack and myocardial issue. The patient would gladly be admitted to a clinic for observation and testing to assist Pfizer in understanding this unfortunate situation. The injection location had redness, hardness. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment due to the event which included multiple lab tests, Angiogram, CR scan and pain medicine.

Two days later, on Monday morning, I contacted my primary care physician&#39;s office, who told me to go to the ER to be evaluated for a blood clot. At the ER, they performed a doppler ultrasound on my right leg and found a superficial clot in the greater saphenous vein of my right leg. There was no evidence of a DVT in the right leg.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

They went to some graduation parties this weekend and his speech continued to get worse which is what prompted them to present to the ED today.  He denies that this is happened before.

But about a year ago he had gone to the emergency room for a heart attack scare. he thought, because this was when COVID first started happening, his whole family was sick in February and they would not test them at that time because they had not been to China and they never found out if they had it but he ended up getting tested for COVID when he was sick like 6 months later and then that went away and he started having heart palpitations and then after that he thought he would get a COVID antibody test and that came back negative, they told him by the time he got the antibody test, they told him he could have had it but it is not showing up on their antibody rapid test thing. He confirms this all occurred last year in 2020, he thinks it was almost a year ago. He would be sitting on the couch and his heart started racing like crazy. He did not know what that was all about&#34;. He said he had no discomfort at all. Concomitant medications were not reported.

Caller received his first dose and was experiencing symptoms such as rapid heart rate and neck spasms and blood pressure. He was too tired to go to the emergency room. He had the weird cough and also stated he had weird stuff on his throat and severe allergies. Regarding his second dose, he wanted to receive but he wanted to know if he could receive a half dose. He also had really bad chest pains and he was going to go to the emergency room but he was too tired to even go. The other reason for calling, he was trying to find out because he was afraid to take the second dose, he wanted to know if he could take a half dose or something, he was trying to find out what he should do. Severe allergies, caller clarified it was like severe allergies or like hay fever kind of, but it was different. Rapid heart rate: He said this began happening the same day as the dose was given, 29May2021, 4 hours after he got the shot. It was not ongoing, it lasted about a day. The rapid heart rate went away the next morning, it stopped doing the crazy things it was doing the next morning, 30May2021. He confirmed that has recovered completely. The chest pain coincided with the rapid heart rate. It went way the same time as the rapid heart rate. It seemed like they both would come and go until the next morning, He confirmed that had recovered completely. He said then the low blood pressure was going on too. It was like it interrupted his sleep, he did not know how to explain it, like he had low blood pressure or like his heart would stop beating and he would wake up gasping for air. It was kind of like a nauseous feeling, he wanted to vomit. It happened with the low blood pressure and was mostly when he was sleeping and a little through the day, the nausea he means, it lasted about a day and a half. The nausea went away on the 30May or the 31May he cannot remember for sure. The cough and stuff in his throat began at the same time the heartbeat stuff started and the cough went away after 2 days. He felt pretty good for about 3 days and then he got really sick, with severe congestion, like bad stuff in his chest and lungs. It was like he was catching pneumonia but then his nose was running, it felt weird like a sickly poison kind of feeling like after he got the shot, he could not tell but it seemed like severe allergies or like hay fever kind of but it was different, it was a weird feeling.

He wanted to know if he could get only a half dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He also wanted to know if there was any correlation to having COVID-19 and having more of a reaction. Caller wanted to know if there was a correlation between having COVID-19 and having more side effects to the vaccine. He stated that his Pharmacist said there might be a correlation to people having COVID before getting the vaccine and having more problematic side effects from the first vaccine instead of the second. Response was given as &#34;he should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. He was referred to speak to healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Healthcare provider would have known the health situation and could access to information that better help inform the decision. From the CONS document on efficacy. Two shots were generally needed to provide the best protection against COVID-19 and the shots were given several weeks apart. The first shot primes the immune system, helping it recognize the virus, and the second shot strengthens the immune response. Side effects after the second shot might be more intense than the ones experienced after the first shot. The side effects are normal signs that body is building protection and should go away within a few days&#34;.

A 45-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Concomitant medication included alfuzosin. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) in the left arm on 23Dec2020 16:00 at the age of 44 years old for COVID-19 immunization. On 14Jan2021, the patient started having fever of 101 to 101.7, diffuse severe muscle aches, and tachycardia of 110 to 130. Thursday evening (14Jan2021) through Sunday (17Jan2021), the patient also had painful lymphadenopathy of the ipsilateral axilla and clavicular lymph node (LN). Thursday evening (14Jan2021), the patient had slight 1-2/10 substernal chest pain on/off. Friday evening around 23:30 (15Jan2021), the patient had chest pain substernal 7-8/10 that lasted for one hour. The burning sensation was worse with cold air. It resolved with paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen. Monday early morning at 04:00 (18Jan2021), the patient experienced STEMI COVID vaccine induced wherein the patient woke up with 10/10 chest pain and shoulder pain which lasted for 30 to 40 minutes and resolved with paracetamol and ibuprofen. The patient also decided to check blood work Monday morning (18Jan2021) while in the hospital. Trop came back 16.28 ng/ml. This is the old trop not high sensitivity. Normal high is 0.30 ng/ml. The patient went to the hospital. ECG showed ST elevation inferior lead. Left heart catheterization was done. The patient have clean coronaries. No evidence of any atherosclerosis. Echocardiogram showed normal EF. No wall motion abnormality. It was concluded that the patient also had coronary spasm. The patient underwent other lab test and procedure which included nasal swab COVID test showed negative on 18Jan2021. Outcome of the lymphadenopathy was recovered on 17Jan2021, of the chest pain was recovered on Jan2021, of the coronary spasm and STEMI was recovering, while of the remaining events was unknown. The events coronary spasm and STEMI resulted in hospitalization and life threatening illness.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported coronary spasm with chest pain and suspected STEMI were likely related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship, and no evidence of any atherosclerosis during left heart catheterization.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                I received the vaccine on 3/21.  On 4/1 I had a breakthrough grand mal seizure walking down the street after being seizure free for almost 5 years.  The seizure resulted in a fractured vertebra (T12).  On 4/5, while resting at home I woke up and had another seizure sitting in a relax the back chair.    I had a mri on my brain that I understand came back normal.  The doctors aren?t sure what caused the seizures but increased my dosage by 500 mgs per day despite my previous dosage controlling my seizures for about 5 years prior to my vaccine.   No doctor has definitively stated the seizures were caused by the vaccine.  However, the timing has prompted me to notify you of these events.

Fever, cough, shortness of breath, coming and going. It lingered until Tuesday, at which time he got a Covid test- negative. Went to dr, and he said there was a possibility of blood clots. Tests showed that he had severe pulmonary embolisms in both lungs- the main and 3 secondary arteries.

Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

Approximately 10 days afterwards (around 2/25), I experienced symptoms of a minor stroke - I experienced lack of coordination in typing and later that evening experienced difficulty with speaking and comprehension, but only for a few minutes. A few days later, that weekend, I had some issues playing songs on the piano I had played before, making a lot of mistakes.  About another 2 weeks afterwards, on 3/9/2021, I experienced more symptoms of stroke. For most of the day I had issues with typing, and later that evening I had some coordination issues with closing a soda bottle. On the morning of 3/10/2021, I continued to experience issues with typing and also had difficulty speaking and understanding my wife. At this point I went to the emergency room and was found/diagnosed to have experienced multiple TIA strokes.

                                                After receiving my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I experienced erratic heartbeats/afib.  It started on Saturday, two days after receiving the shot and I debated on whether to go to the ER.  I ended up seeing my cardiologist the following week but by then was feeling better.  The irregular heartbeats last about 3 days, getting progressively better by the third day, but it was a very slow process.  Obviously very scary since it was pretty severe at first and I didn&#39;t know if I was having a cardiac event.

The subsequent illness I reported in V-safe seems unrelated to my vaccination. I experienced fever (up to 102 degrees) and general malaise for three successive nights starting on June 4th, 2021 (2&#43; months after second dose). The fever only came at night and broke in the early morning each night. I had two COVID screenings on June 7th, both came back negative. The final fever occurred the night of June 6th. I continued experiencing malaise and general weakness and had some bloodwork done. My bloodwork came back indicating Fe deficiency anemia, and I have been experiencing this condition since. The cause is suspected to be due to overuse of NSAIDs in dealing with a bulging disc in my cervical spine from early March onward. I am scheduled for endoscopy to further investigate whether I am having bleeding issues causing the anemia. as previously mentioned, seems unrelated to vaccination.

Symptoms became worse throughout the weekend.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

                                                On or about 0845 am, RN administered Covid vaccine (2nd one for patient). Attempted administration with syringe (a Haiou, 1ml, 23g, 1&#39;&#39;, Lot 20JC2, Exp: 10-17-25) resulted in needle going into patient&#39;s arm, but the 2 piece retractable distal needle and hub separated from the proximal tube part of the syringe resulting in COVID vaccine dose being lost. None of the 1st dose entered patient&#39;s arm. With needle and distal hub still fully immersed in patient&#39;s arm, RN removed it and held pressure on bleeding. RN informed patient that needle failed, to which pt stated he was &#34;shocked,&#34; and felt an &#34;electric&#34; sensation when needle was inserted. Patient tolerated well. Bleeding abated. RN administered a 2nd dose of vaccine to the patient with no problems on the same LUE, more medial by about 2 inches than the first attempt. Bandage applied to both sites due to scant bleeding. Patient tolerated well, but showed no emotion. Pt complied with all instructions, and RN thanked patient for coming in.

                                                a 46-year-old male with no known past medical history who initially presented complaining of headache and neck stiffness with onset the morning of 04/03/2021.  The patient states that his headache was initially gradual in onset and eventually decreased in severity on 4/5 however, on 04/06 after a day at the beach the patient developed a severe headache with rapid onset that he described as the worst headache in his life.  He did try to medicate himself at home with 600-800 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hr with minimal decrease in his headache pain.  As result he presented to  urgent care for initial evaluation who sent him to the emergency department for possible brain bleed.  On arrival to the emergency department the patient had a head CT which showed trace subarachnoid hemorrhage in the basilar cisterns likely due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm.  He was transferred to  for continued workup of the subarachnoid hemorrhage with CTA and possible IR intervention.  At time my evaluation patient was resting comfortably in the bed.  He continued to complain of severe headache and neck stiffness.  He additionally notes that light and loud sounds make his headache worse.  He denied any focal weakness, paresthesia&#39;s, numbness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or any other concerning neuro symptoms.  Patient was hypertensive during my evaluation despite being on a Cardene drip.  Patient&#39;s mother was at bedside and was able to assist with history.

Since then I have had heaviness in my chest and other symptoms like difficulty breathing while walking or talking, etc.  I was otherwise previously healthy -- non-smoker, drink very occasionally, mostly vegetarian, light on sugar consumption, daily exercise.  I went to the doctor and then the ER at a local hospital on April 28.  They found fluid and possible inflammation around the hearth along with very high blood pressure.  Since then I have had medication for inflammation and high BP.  They are still doing tests to figure out what is wrong with me.

A 46-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 26Apr2021, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  The patient had no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive  any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 27Apr2021, the patient reported to the hospital with complaints of chest pain with electrocardiogram (EKG) showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers. On 27Apr2021, the patient experienced non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and myocarditis. The patient was hospitalized for one day. and the event required an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: negative on 02May2021, covid-19: negative on 02May2021, electrocardiogram: unknown showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST  elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers, myocarditis: unknown. Cath report did not reveal coronary artery disease (CAD). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of NSTEMI (acute myocardial infarction), myocarditis (myocarditis), chest pain (chest pain), EKG showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers. The outcome of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), myocarditis, chest pain and electrocardiogram (EKG) showing non-diagnostic diffuse ST elevations and elevated cardiac biomarkers was recovered on an unknown date. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient was tested for COVID-19 on 02May2021 and was negative.   Information on lot number/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment of the case.  Based on currently known drug profile it is unlikely that events non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and myocarditis are related to BNT162B2. This case will be re-evaluated upon receipt of additional information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Heart Attack. A feeling of burning in my arms and mouth of the stomach, in addition to fatigue when walking, started on June 12, 2021. I never had such pain before and thought it&#39;s just a stomach virus or so. As the pain continues, I called my primary-care Dr. early morning of June 17 and scheduled appointment for a week later. But around 9:30 pm that day, June 17, the pain became so severe, in addition to nausea and shortness of breath. I went to emergency room and have been told that there is acute heart attack in progress and was moved to the Critical Care Unit in the Heart and Vascular Center. A blockage has been removed and a stent was installed in morning of June 18, through heart catheterization procedure. As there was damage to the heart muscle due to the heart attack, I am supposed to go back later, in 4-6 weeks, to remove couple more blockages and install stents.

About 7 days after the vaccine, it started to worsen.  I felt pain, chest pressure, back shoulder pain,  jaw pain,  and shortness of breath.   I called the main local  hospital number and was instructed to go to the ER.  I did go to the ER and they did blood work, EKG which confirmed that I was having a heart attack.  I was stabilized and was then transferred my via ambulance to A Medical Center which is bigger hospital and better equipped.  I was admitted and the next day, I had surgery for a heart catheter. They also placed 2 stents in my heart.   I was in the hospital for 4 days and was discharged with a prescription for Furosemide 40mg, rest, cardiac rehab, and to follow up with cardiologist.  Prior to the heart attack, I only had hypertension.

                                                The night after my first shot, I felt pressure on my lungs, It felt as if I had the onset of Pleurisy as I have had that issue in the past.  I figure I would wait to get it treated as it is not always picked up in the x-ray in its infant stages (based on past experience).  On March 2, the pain became unbearable and I went into a urgent care center to get an x-ray and something to help with my issue.  The urgent care did not take my x-ray they immediately sent me to the hospital strongly intimating that the problem was probably more serious than I thought.  I was in the emergency room, they ran tests and made me comfortable enough as they also gave me a ct-scan which is when they found the bi-lateral pulmonary embolisms.  I have since gone to my primary care physician and he directed me to a hematologist/oncologist.  The event was found to be unprovoked.  I am on blood thinners for 6 months.

After 10 minutes , One other person came to our terminal reported that there is a person on the floor. I rushed to check on him. He was on the floor flat . I asked him if he is ok and if I can call 911. He said he is fine . He was helped to sit on the chair. He was wearing a black mask and seating. I asked him if he wants to me to call 911. He said he is feeling better. There was blood dripping out the mask. I asked him to check . His lips were split and his mouth was bloody. He fell flat on his face, that resulted in the bloody mouth. I gave him a ice pack and sat next to him . He called his wife and waited in the same area. I sat next to him. His wife came in and took him to the immediate care .

The pain continued throughout May 10th becoming worse with deep breaths or any type of internal strain (cough, sneeze, etc). That evening, I took two Tylenol and later two Ibuprofen and was able to sleep. The pain persisted for the next week, slowly improving but not fully going away. On May 15th I conducted a telemedicine appointment and was advised to go to either Urgent Care or the ER. I chose the ER at  Hospital. A D-Dimer test showed elevated results and a CT scan was ordered. The CT revealed blood clots in my right lung, specifically &#34;Subpleural conslidation in the posterior basilar segment the right lower lobe is present, compatible with pulmonary infarct. Question additional pulmonary infarct in the lateral basilar segment the lower right lobe. Probable atelectasis in the left lung base.&#34; MD prescribed Eliquis @ 10mg 2x daily and I was discharged with a referral to    .

Pt is a smoker, HTN and dyslipidemia. I was just informed a patient received the Pfizer vaccine yesterday @ 1129. Arrived to ER @1700 with a STEMI. He went for a heart cath yesterday and CABG this morning. Per the cath report his LAD was occluded.  I believe he was more aware of his symptoms after receiving the vaccine and that is why he finally came in.

A 49-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6199 and expiration date not provided) intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 16Mar2021 13:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no relevant medical history. Family history included diabetes (mother). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200 and expiration date not provided) Injected intramuscularly in left upper arm on 23Feb2021, 13:30 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced DVT symptoms, soft tissue injury, muscle pull and ankle strain. The patient experienced DVT left lower extremity and bilateral pulmonary emboli on 23Apr2021. The patient called regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He had adverse events to report. He has a DVT on his left calf, which he later clarified was left lower extremity. He is currently on double dose of apixaban (ELIQUIS) since Friday. He finally went and got it looked at. He is still being treated and will be seeing a hematologist. He stated that DVT symptoms occurred after first dose and was undiagnosed. He treated it as soft tissue injury and thought it was a muscle pull and ankle strain. Eliquis was started on 23Apr2021 and dose is 5 mg. He is taking two tablets twice daily for 7 days and then 1, 5mg tablet bid (twice a day) as well. No emergency room or physician&#39;s office required but Urgent care facility was visited on 23Apr2021. During this visit, they did Lab work, D Dimer results 1590 on 23Apr2021; Venous Doppler resulted in positive DVT in Left Lower Extremity. Chest CT resulted in positive peripheral defects in small branches of the lower lobes bilaterally, left greater than right, consistent with Pulmonary Emboli. Left sided pleural effusion and left basillary infiltrate, possibly atelectasis or developing infarct. Few pleural based nodular densities at right lung base, again atelectasis versus developing infarcts. The rest just states what was normal. Eliquis was prescribed on 23Apr2021, 5 mg two tablets twice daily for 7 days, then regular dose times 7 days. He is to report to hematologist on 29Apr2021. The outcome of the events deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism was unknown. The reporter assessed the events as serious (life-threatening).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events DVT of legs and Pulmonary embolism cannot be totally excluded.

He also complained that despite his protest, the person who administered the shot insisted to inject on his shoulder joint.  He developed a bigger-than-quarter-size bruise on his right inner arm the next day. He was feeling tired the following days. On May 4 around 3:30, I heard he was making loud noises. I came to his side immediately. At the time I thought he was making louder than usual snores. I nudged him gently but he didn&#39;t respond.  After about 15 seconds, the sound stopped, and he had no breath. I then called 911 within 10 seconds, tried to do CPR on him. It took EMS 6 minutes to arrive even though we live very close to a fire station in a well-accessed urban area. EMS worked on him for about 30 minutes before transported him to hospital. They continued to work on him for a while. He never regained breath.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in left arm on 03Feb2021 (batch/lot number and expiration date not reported) at the age of 49 years old, as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from Dec2020 to an unknown date, vascular disease, bilateral stents placement, cataracts since he was born. Concomitant medication included gabapentin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date and ongoing. On 04Feb2021, the patient experienced left arm injection site pain. The patient experienced dizziness, falling, and couldn&#39;t go to work on unspecified date. He was treated by his (MD) physician, was given a CT scan, echocardiogram, and found to have some clots. He stated he has a history of vascular disease and had bilateral stents placed a year ago. He was placed back on an aspirin/Plavix regimen and referred to a neurologist because he has no motor skills anymore. He stated he failed all the tests for motor skills for his arms and legs. He was advised not to take the second dose of the vaccine and was diagnosed with neuropathy and autoimmune disorder (caller does not specify which disorder). He reported being positive for Covid-19 in Dec2020. He wanted to know what else he can do for his symptoms and is offering to be tested by Pfizer for treatment. The symptoms come in really hard seven days later. He actually had to go to the (ER) emergency and they worked on him and a whole string of doctors. He went to the emergency room and something was going on and wanted him to go to a family practitioner. They sent him to vascular, neurological and now they want to send him to a research center. It was a whole week after receiving vaccine before he began having symptoms. With the neuropathy and autoimmune, he cannot work like he did.  He can hardly walk. Unspecified autoimmune was diagnosed last week. He can&#39;t remember the name of it. They told him not to take second one because the first one did what it did to him. It hurt a little and it was quick. The next day (04Feb2021), he said his arm was sore a little. He is only taking 4 medications and they looked it up. He did not think they were relevant. He was disoriented and fell and hit his head a couple of times. They ran an MRI on his head trying to figure that part out. That was done last week.  He doesn&#39;t know the date and said it may have been on Friday. Results were good. The date he was disoriented was Wednesday 03Feb2021, when he took the shot. He has been disoriented and has been that way ever since. They kept him for 15 minutes to make sure no one passed out. He has been disoriented since then. He could not think clearly, and he could not do his job. He tore tendons in between ribs.  He first thought he actually broke his ribs, but did not. There were two different falls. He cannot feel feet or anything.  His motor skills are OK but when they did neuropathy test, they put needles in and shocked him to make his motor fire. His reflexes were really bad. He fell and hit elbow to keep from falling on face and twisted going down hitting 3-4 ribs on left side.  It has been over 3 weeks now for his ribs. They are tender but they are not like the initial blow. It feels like they are healing.  He fell and hit head a week ago.  He was unsure of the exact date. He did not go to the emergency room with this one because the bed caught him.  He fell and hit his head.  All he has left is scabs. He cannot walk or lift anything (11Feb2021). That next Wednesday, he got ready to go to work and was so delusional and could not go in.  He slept from 5:30 all that day and all that night. Then Thursday, he gets up and goes to work and goes slower, just to see what happened on Wednesday. He had fatigue and was disoriented. He did not provide start date or outcome for fatigue. He walked in and said either call an ambulance or he would go home. He went home and that was the last day of work. He then stated he laid in the car for 30 minutes and he said he is going to the emergency room.  He went straight there that day. He had stents put in lower part of his body a year before. The neuropathy and the autoimmune kicked in 7 days later after the shot. The reason he went to the ER is because he thought it was his stent. He had bilateral, 4 of them. He was having chest pain and hurting all over on 11Feb2021. He thought he was having a heart attack. He was seen in the emergency room and released. It depends on how far he goes, how the chest pain worsens. Right now, he is ok, but when he gets up and moves around, it does the same thing.

Symptoms worsened and he was admitted to ICU on May 21st via the ED for multiorgan failure including respiratory failure with R pneumonia, Shock, Renal failure, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, shock liver failure requiring invasive vent support and treatment for septic shock including vasopressor support and antibiotic therapy.  He was started on CRRT on the 22nd.  His INR continues to rise and Hb dropping consistent with worsening DIC.  Blood cultures are positive for MRSA.  He will likely die from progressive septic shock and MSOF.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route on right shoulder single dose for COVID-19 immunization; second dose with lot number: EV10161 on 22Apr2021, first dose with lot number: EP7533 on 01Apr2021, at 49-year-old. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. The patient was non-smoker, non-drinker. The patient had a little headache with the second shot but 2 weeks later on 03May2021 started having chills every night and would sweat. He was having chills and hot flashes and stomach was cramping and when inhaled like taking a deep breath, felt pressure in his back almost like pneumonia like lungs were filling with fluid or clotting. On the 07May2021, he took a little flu medication Theraflu over the counter (treatment) thinking that&#39;d clear it up. Every time he took a deep breath, it&#39;d just hurt right below my chest and in stomach and skin became extremely prickly. He&#39;d have like a low-grade fever like 99. This was 2 weeks after the second shot, so he went to the ER on 07May2021 and was given a COVID test, a fluid test and lab work trying and figure what he was having. One of his blood test - Dimer test showed kind of high levels with mainly blood clot so they gave him a CT scan, scan showed no blood clots, no kidneys stones or anything like that should had any sweating. ER doctor gave him an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) for infection like diverticulitis or diverticulosis. The doctor said the patient did not have a stomach infection, his tests showing such high levels for clots so the doctor did more lab work a PRC, CRT, TRP or CPR, a CRT lab work and some fiber or Fibrogen which was for thickening of blood. Those numbers are supposed to be between 400 and 420, his was 879 today (17May2021). The patient did have COVID, it was positive COVID antigen test, I got those results today (17May2021). Outcome of the events was unknown.

An 49-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 11May2021 16:45 (Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1st 0.3 ml single dose at the age of 49-years-old for covid-19 immunisation; testosterone cipionate, via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 (Lot Number: 88945; Expiration Date: 30Sep2021) and ongoing, at 150 mg, 2x/week (150 mg injection bi weekly ) for gonads, low testosterone. The patient medical history included low testosterone, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, COVID in the past (He did not know initially he had it, he had lost of taste and smell). Concomitant medication included dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing. None prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history relevant to AEs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 17May2021. Time of onset (24-hour clock): Roughly 18:00. Usually he took the testosterone in the morning, but he forgot. He was wrapping up the day, took the testosterone and by 18:02 he was on the ground, cold. The patient got his vaccination last Tuesday (11May2021). He was also on testosterone for gonadism. He usually administered the vaccine in his shoulders. He took the testosterone bi-weekly. On Monday he administered it his left shoulder and on Thursday it is in his right shoulder. After getting the vaccine he administered testosterone in his right shoulder on Thursday and had no issues. The patient mentioned everyone else who got the COVID Vaccine he knows had sore arm, nausea, but he did not have any of that. On Monday (17May2021) he injected his testosterone into the same arm/location, left arm, where he got the COVID vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction. He contacted his doctor and went to the emergency room. The patient confirmed he felt like he had recovered completely from the anaphylactic reaction. Caller clarified the anaphylactic reaction. He did the testosterone injection in the same spot he had the COVID injection. Within 5 minutes it was like his skin was on fire. He was sweating, had stomach cramps, and was throwing up. Once he stopped throwing up he looked at his arms and saw they were solid red. They were all inflamed. His legs were inflamed. His hands swelled up. They were red. He had to take his wedding ring off. He was itchy. It was like he was on fire. He was sore, and sore where injected the Testosterone into left arm. He confirmed he had no problems swallowing or breathing. Based on the symptoms he was experiencing he realized these were things listed to be aware of when getting the COVID shot and to seek medical attention for. He went to the ER and they verified it was an anaphylactic reaction. Treatment included: He was given an Epi-Pen. It made him feel like off, like he had too much coffee or something. he was also given Benadryl and some Anti-Inflammatory to calm his body down. Investigations: He had blood drawn at the ER. However, he does not know if was actually tested. He was informed when the nurse drew blood it would be up to the doctor, but he has no knowledge if anything was done. Action taken of testosterone cypionate was dose not changed. Outcome of the events was recovered on 17May2021.

Patient given 2 mg of lorazepam which aborted the seizure, however he remained unresponsive.  IV fluids were started, and patient remained hypotensive after 3 L of fluids.  Bedside cardiac ultrasound was performed which showed a large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology.  We continued fluid resuscitation and patient was intubated, while stat Cardiology consult was called.  Patient suffered a cardiac arrest shortly after intubation. Cardiology performed emergent pericardiocentesis at the bedside which showed hemopericardium with output of greater than 500 mL of blood.  ROSC was achieved following pericardiocentesis, and we continued resuscitative measures.  Emergent arterial line and central venous lines were placed.  Patient began to have profuse bleeding from all orifices, and massive transfusion protocol was initiated.  Patient was stabilized enough to be taken to CT scanner which showed an extensive aortic dissection extending into the RCA, abdominal aorta, brachiocephalic artery, common carotids, and into the abdominopelvic vasculature.  Cardiac and vascular surgery were consulted stat, and the decision was made to take the patient emergently to the OR.  We were informed shortly after that the patient had expired en route to the operating room and they were unable to obtain ROSC. Final impression: type A aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade. Second dose of mRNA vaccine (unknown if Pfizer or Moderna) received two days prior to event.

                                                2 days after 1st shot I felt extreme fatigue and shortness of breath for several days. Got tested for COVID with negative results. Went to hospital on 16th of February and was admitted due to heart condition and recent heart attack. I told them my next vaccine was due on the 18th and they gave it to me while I was admitted.  Within 24 hours I had another heart attack. I was sent to another hospital for an Angiogram where they expected to find blockage and prepared to install a stint. They found no blockage. There is no medical explination.

About 14 days later I started to get a rash on hands and feet with burning sensation.  I was evaluated and diagnosed with Covid toes.  About 1 week later I developed a fever and was evaluated and diagnosed with pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and a DVT.  I continue to get worse to include arthritis in hands, wrists, feet and ankles.  I was admitted to the hospital with worsening pneumonia, reactive arthritis and a rash on elbows, knees, hands and feet.  I was in the hospital for about 5 days.  I have been evaluated by rheumatology, pulmonary and dermatology since.  The ongoing theory is I have a reactive arthritis from COVID and may have developed psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis.

He was initially bleeding and unconscious and was brought by EMS to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital he had a temperature of 40 C. He was found to have 2 small left temporal hemmorhagic contusions on CT scan. He had a seizure during the hospitalization. He was initially treated for HSV encephalitis but it is not clear if that was confirmed. The hospital team may not have known of the recent vaccination. He improved during the hospitalization, but remained with a very unsteady gait. He could not return to the group home. He was transferred to a rehab facility to receive PT on 02/16/2021. He remains at rehab. Prior to the fall, on the 3rd day after vaccination, on 2/8/21 at about 10 am, the patient coughed and had a small blood on the inside of his face mask while at his day program. He was seen by his PCP and had no abnormal findings. He had a CBC, BMP and CXR and all were unremarkable.

Pulmonary embolism without acute cor pulmonale, unspecified chronicity, unspecified pulmonary embolism type (HCC) 04/26/2021   Resolved Hospital Problems No resolved problems to display.   CONSULTS: None    INPATIENT PROCEDURES: None    DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY: Patient is a 51 y.o. male with a past medical history of psoriasis, environmental allergies who presents today with sudden shortness of breath, left side pleuritic chest pain 7/10, worsened with deep inspiration.  No recent travel, no family history, no history of malignancies, no immobilization or surgeries. He had his 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on April 1.  He does not have a history of COVID-19 infection, and COVID-19 PCR test was negative in ER. His blood pressure is a little high at 170 6/83 mm, pulse 76 per minute saturating 96% on room air, troponin less than 6, BNP 16, WBC 12.3,, EKG without any significant ST T-wave changes. CT angiogram of the chest shows nonocclusive thrombi in almost all the lobes, there is no saddle embolus noted.  There is no evidence of right heart strain.  Echo: The technical quality of the exam was limited due to suboptimal acoustic windows. The left ventricle is normal in size. There is normal left ventricular wall thickness. The left ventricular ejection fraction is 60%. Regional wall motion abnormalities cannot be excluded due to limited visualization. The right ventricular size, thickness, and function are normal. No significant valvular pathology identified with Doppler examination. There was insufficient tricuspid regurgitation envelope detected to calculate right ventricular systolic pressure.  Injection of contrast documented no interatrial shunt. There is no comparison study available.  He was started on Heparin gtt. And admitted for observation. He required no supplemental oxygen. He was discharged later pm on Eliquis 10 mg bid for 7 days, than 5 mg bid for 3 months. I am questioning did he had COVID-19 vaccine related bilateral PE. His hypercoagulable profile is pending. He has no sign of malignancy, no new symptoms, no weight loss. He had normal colonoscopy 2 yrs ago.  He should follow up with his PCP.  He was given work excuse from 4/26-5/3/21. She shouldn&#39;t take non steroidal anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen (Motrin), Naproxen, Naprosyn, Voltaren, Relafen ... meds because of blood thinner Eliquis. He can take Tylenol 500 mg 1-2 tabs 3-4x a day as needed. He was also prescribed Lidoderm patch.    For HTN he was started on DASH diet and Norvasc 5 mg daily. He should follow up with PCP next week.  Also he was instructed to quit smoking.

The patient was hypertensive (197/129) with a FSBG of 95mg/dL. During stroke assessment, the patient had new onset facial palsy/droop and need speech abnormality which signaled a stroke alert. 12-lead EKG was unremarkable. EMS transported the patient to Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient presented with a headache, chest heaviness, and slurred speech, but no aphasia. NIH stroke scale was 0. Patient remained hypertensive (170/109). Labs, tests, and imaging did not indicate rtPA administration. ED physician administered 0.4mg SL Nitroglycerin, 10mg IV Hydralazine, and 325mg PO Aspirin prior to admission for suspected Transient Ischemic Attack. Upon admission, differential was TIA vs. CVA vs. ACS. Admitting physician ordered HbA1C, lipid panel, MRI brain, CTA head/neck, 2D echo, and neurology consult. Throughout course of admission, patient had recurring midsternal chest pain that was relieved with Nitroglycerin. Imaging ruled out CVA. Given elevated TGs and Cholesterol, patient was started on Atorvastatin 40mg PO. Suspected TIA and ACS.  Neurology consult reviewed the labs and imaging, and stated the episodes of stuttering are most commonly associated with anxiety or stress reaction. Neuro did not recommend any further workup unless this happened again unprovoked. Patient was discharged after a 3-day admission with diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, unspecified. The patient was prescribed 81mg PO Aspirin, 20mg PO Lisinopril, and 40mg PO Atorvastatin.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

Patient is a 51-year-old male with a PMHx significant for hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis and morbid obesity who initially presented to the ED for evaluation of chest pain, cough and shortness of breath.   On presentation, vitals were mostly unremarkable other than some mild tachycardia and tachypnea.  Patient was able to maintain adequate oxygenation on room air but was placed on supplemental oxygen for comfort.  Blood work was mostly unremarkable.  ABG was not particularly concerning.  Troponin was negative x3.  Patient underwent chest CTA which showed basilar atelectasis bilaterally and scattered groundglass opacities and scattered borderline size hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with patient&#39;s known sarcoidosis.   Patient was treated with supportive care and monitored overnight.  He was able to maintain sufficient oxygen levels.  On the time my evaluation, patient continues to complain of bilateral rib pain worse with deep breaths consistent with costochondritis.  I discussed with the patient that he will need to continue to take NSAIDs on a scheduled basis to help with his discomfort.  Additionally I offered to prescribe cough medicine. I discussed possibly discharging the patient on steroids however he states that he makes a point to avoid taking steroids due to his history of hemochromatosis.  At this point, patient no longer requires care in the hospital and can be discharged home.  Patient is agreeable with the plan and all questions have been answered appropriately.

                                                On 5/20/21 the patient was at home with his mother when he had acute nausea, light-headedness, and abdominal pain. He presented to the ED by ambulance. Excerpt from ED notes od MD follows: &#34;Initial ED interventions: iv fluids, low dose iv ativan, iv toradol, iv zofran.  ED course: patient arrives very anxious, writhing on bed, difficult to redirect. With chronic tonicity, not seizing. Mother arrives, and he recognizes her, seems to be consoled somewhat by her presence, but she is unable to direct him, and describes his behavior as irregular, and events acute this evening at her home.  Patient rests, and then HR decrease to 50s on monitior and patient found to be pulseless - I immediately start chest compressions, and achieve ROSC after PEA arrest with administration of EPI/compressions. Patient intubated per procedure note without complication. L femoral central attained per procedure note without complication. CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips. Pronounced deceased at 22:00.  MDM: Initial concern for but not limited to appendicitis, AAA, diverticulitis, renal stones, pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, toxic ingestion, ACS, obstruction, perforation, sepsis (2/2 PNA, UTI, meningitis, intra-abdominal infection), AAA, dissection, PE - as ED course progresses, differential narrows and consider more likely PEA arrest secondary to ACS, PE, dissection, AAA, necrotic pancreatitis, tension PNX (less likely). Considered but do not suspect seizures, stroke. Imaging studies reviewed - CXR with ETT in place, no acute pathology. CTA chest/A/P remarkable for massive proximal B/L PE. Labs reviewed. ECGs without STEMI, with sinus tach initially, LBBB after initial ROSC, and then AFib in RVR on subsequent ECG. Per above, patient suffered massive B/L PE, with subsequent cardiac arrest, despite heoric efforts including thrombolysis. Death called art 22:00.  Diagnosis: massive B/L PEs, PEA arrest.  Disposition: deceased.&#34;

There was a blood clot in my brain that was broken up after tPA was administered about 2 hours after the symptoms of the stroke set in. To date (May 30) I have had many tests, including 2 MRIs, CT scans, TEE, heart monitoring etc.    So far, it has been called a &#34;cryptogenic stroke&#34; because there is no cause.  The only thing different was the vaccine I received 5 days before the stroke.

A 52-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 08May2021 at 15:30 (at the age of 52 years old) (Batch/Lot number: EW0176, Expiration date was unknown) as the 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/Lot number: ER8730, Expiration date was unknown) on 17Apr2021 at 2:30 PM (at the age of 52 years old) for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was not administered at the military facility. Relevant medical history included ongoing high cholesterol, ongoing high low density lipoproteins (LDLs), ongoing high triglycerides, and patient might have borderline diabetes, possibly prediabetic, but the reporter was not quite sure. The patient had family history of heart problems. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medications, but the reporter did not know the medications that the patient was taking. It was also reported that the patient was not completely compliant with his medications. The patient had no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior to vaccinations (within 4 weeks), the patient had no other vaccinations and there were no adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations. The reporter stated that in the morning at the time of the report on 13May2021, about 5 days after the second COVID-19 vaccine, the patient had signs of a transient ischemic attack; he lost control of the left side of the face and possibly of the left side of his body; he had elevated blood pressure 180/100 and came down to 140/100 after the one-hour long episode; and he experienced weakness, but was able to move around. At the time of the report, the patient was on his way to the emergency room (ER). The event &#34;loss of control of left side of face&#34; did require a visit to the emergency room. It was further reported that the patient had signs of a transient ischemic attack and loss of control of the left side of his face and maybe the left side of his body, but the reporter was not sure; he also had some weakness and this episode lasted about an hour during which time the patient&#39;s blood pressure was 180/100. After the hour, his blood pressure came down to about 140/100. The patient was able to move around and on the way to the emergency department. No further information was available regarding the patient&#39;s visit to the emergency room at the time of the report. The reporter was asking for information on transient ischemic attacks and the Covid 19 vaccine and if there were reports of strokes as well. The reporter stated his family called several doctor friends and doctor relatives and based on the patient&#39;s symptoms, it seemed likely that he had a transient ischemic attack. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 52-years-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 21May2021 10:10 (reported as 10:10 EST) (at the age of 52-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22May2021, the patient called to report an adverse reaction to 1st dose of vaccine, and currently in the emergency room (ER) at the hospital, in a bed with heavy clotting issues in his left kidney through his bladder which was causing urinary issues, literally urinating large blood clots. He currently had a catheter in, they have done blood work and CT scan, but no results provided. The patient had no issues with anything with prostate or kidney but hemorrhaging blood clots. The patient was not yet admitted to the hospital, just in the ER somewhere around 10:00 in the morning. The patient had a follow up and still at home had a catheter and still he was bleeding and follow up tomorrow with Urology department at 10:00; had full blood work follow up tomorrow and had a CT scan. Everything came back as normal as far as his organs go. The patient added, &#34;I would appreciate it if someone would call me with some professional advice what I should do about this whether I need to take the second dose. I need some clarification on what is going on with this and then I need to have a discussion on whether I should take the second dose or not.&#34; The outcome of the event was not recovered, at the time of this report. The seriousness of the events was unspecified by the reporter.  There is a medical information request included Caller (male, age 52 years)- his question was the first and 2nd dose the same. Tomorrow he should have the full make up back and causes of this from the doctor. It has been a rather traumatic event which he thought was going to be nothing.&#34; Due date of second dose. Response included: As noted in the Fact Sheet for Recipients, the patient should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. They refer him to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. His healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.&#34; and from VR-As the Prescribing Information does not include all adverse reactions that have been reported or that may occur, please consult with doctor/healthcare provider about what he had experienced/were experiencing.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Following vaccination, patient felt achy and mildly feverish. During the night, he got up to use the restroom and felt palpitations and lightheadedness, which persisted during the morning. A colleague at work evaluated the patient&#39;s pulse, noting it to be irregular and fast, so patient went to the ED for evaluation. EKG was performed and patient was found to be in new onset atrial fibrillation.

Then that night I woke up at 2:30 AM with severe pain in my right knee.  I was unable to bend the knee or walk for the next 36 hours.  After that the pain transitioned to the back of my calf muscle for the next few days.  The pain then went back to my knee for a day and then returned to the back of my calf muscle.  On 3/30/21 I saw my primary care physician who then sent me to get an ultrasound which determined that the pain in my knee and calf were caused by blood clots (DVT).  I was then prescribed Eliquis 5 mg blood thinners.

                                                Blood clots in right leg below knee; he passed out from pain; pain in his right knee; he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all; knee was swollen; couldn&#39;t walk/limping around; his knee more stiff; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 53-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EN6206), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 21Mar2021 at 10:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing Factor V Leiden heterozygous, allergies to mushrooms from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and a torn meniscus in his right knee and he had surgery 3 to 4 years ago. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took Cephalexin and Percocet and experienced allergies. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and has not been tested post vaccination. On 22Mar2021 at night around 2:30AM, the patient woke up and started walking to the bathroom and he passed out from pain. He had pain in his right knee. He thought he had torn his knee again. He had surgery 3 or 4 years ago for a torn meniscus in his right knee and he thought he had torn his meniscus again. He passed out, his wife found him and he went back to bed. In the morning, his knee was still very very sore, he couldn&#39;t bend his knee at all. He took an Advil between 6:30AM and 8:00AM. He hadn&#39;t taken any medications prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. His knee was swollen but the pain was manageable. He couldn&#39;t walk, he was on crutches for about 24 hours then the swelling started coming down and he put a brace on his knee. He could then walk without the crutches but it was still painful. The next day he had pain in the back of his knee. He thought the pain was caused because he had put the brace on and had been using the crutches. Like he had made his knee more stiff from not using it. He was limping around and the pain was bearable. At that point, the pain was maybe a 4 on a scale of 1-10 where his pain had been a 9 on a scale of 1-10. He took another Advil and he realized the pain in the back of his knee wasn&#39;t going away. He went to see his family doctor and his doctor was able to get him in that same day for an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed 2 blood clots behind his right knee. The patient had blood clots in right leg below knee. The week of the report, he got an appointment with a hematologist. The hematologist reviewed his case and the doctor isn&#39;t 100% sure the blood clots were from the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine but the doctor isn&#39;t ruling it out either because it happened within 24 hours of receiving his first COVID-19 dose. He hadn&#39;t done anything strenuous before getting the COVID-19 vaccine, nothing that he thinks would have caused the blood clots. He would like to add, what he thinks is relevant, is that he is positive for Factor V. He reports he has one copy and Factor V only impacts about 3% of the population. The hematologist thought that he might be prone to developing blood clots. The hematologist reports that he has had patients who have had the COVID-19 virus who have developed blood clots. Maybe it&#39;s possible that the COVID-19 antibodies were trying to build up his immune system to COVID-19 and it created something similar to having the COVID-19 virus. If he is predisposed to blood clots then the COVID-19 vaccine may have precipitated the blood clots. His second COVID-19 vaccine is scheduled for Sunday, 11Apr2021. He had talked to both his family doctor and his hematologist and they both thought he should be ok in getting the second COVID-19 vaccine. He was prescribed blood thinners. If the second COVID-19 vaccine caused more blood clots the blood thinners would help him. He was asking if there is any additional information or guidance on receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine after his reaction. The pharmacist told him that the COVID-19 vaccine trials were all done in the left arm. He received his vaccine in his right arm and his right knee was affected. If he gets the second COVID-19 vaccine he&#39;s getting it in his left arm. He was prescribed Eliquis 5mg take one tablet twice daily. The outcome of the event blood clots in right leg below knee was recovering while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Shortness of breath; pericardial effusion requiring drainage/fluid around the heart that made the heart beat super fast to pump up blood; inflammation of the heart sac; fluid overload on the lung; fluid around the heart that made the heart beat super fast to pump up blood; This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) reported for himself. A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left upper arm at 53 years old on 20Mar2021 08:00 (Lot Number: EP7534) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure from 2018, he says he has had this for roughly 3 years. Concomitant medication included amlodipine at 5mg once a day for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date in 2018 and ongoing, he says he has been taking this for a few years, maybe 3 years. No additional vaccines were administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect or within 4 weeks. He was not sick at the time of vaccination previously. The patient was calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. He says he is just trying to get answers because what he experienced was very alarming to him. He got the vaccine at 8:00 in the morning. He says a student did it, she took a long time, she was very timid. He says she was being supervised by an RN. He experienced shortness of breath on 07Apr2021, he says it was in the morning that the shortness of breath started, because he did make an appointment to go the the COVID test, he got the COVID test around noon that same day. He says he was diagnosed with pericardial effusion requiring drainage and inflammation of the heart sac. He says he had fluid overload on the lungs that required IV diuretics. He says the symptoms started after the vaccine, and these symptoms were what was causing the shortness of breath. He says the fluid around the heart made the heart beat super fast to pump up blood. He says the fluid triggered the shortness of breath. He says when they removed fluid the breathing got easier but then it settled into the lungs. He says Tuesday he dropped off the cliff, Tuesday or Wednesday night, one of them, for two nights he was on oxygen, they gave him a diuretic for the lungs, after 12 hours he started feeling better, continued to get better and better after they moved the fluid from the lungs with Lasix through the IV. He says he doesn&#39;t fit the profile of someone who would develop these issues, he has no history, no cancer, no autoimmune disorders. He says they say well maybe it is the virus but the doctors currently have no specific answers for the caller. He says they told him that someone having this would be the profile of an IV drug user. He says he never uses drugs, he does not fit a profile like this. He says he wants to be fully vaccinated. He says the timing is suspicious with the vaccine shot. He says it is 50/50 on the doctor&#39;s opinions, half say to get the shot, the other half say don&#39;t do it. He says they say the second shot is worse. He says he is confused as to what to do, that he understands this is a big experiment, he wants the vaccine but not at the cost of another visit to the hospital. He says he was at the hospital on oxygen, he couldn&#39;t get out of bed for a day. He says the doctor said there was a study in (Withheld), the caller says he did a lot of research in the hospital for 6 days, that says the demographic is younger but it is heart issues with men for the heart with the Pfizer vaccine. He says they are studying it. He says a couple of doctors referred to that, the ones that say don&#39;t get the shot, not yet. He says he can&#39;t pinpoint it exactly. He says it could have been a fluke but the timing is very suspicious. He says that because of some of the side effects, his week in hospital, he was concerned for his life, he wants to be fully vaccinated but not at the cost of going though this or cost of killing him. He says he does not want to go through this again, he will not get vaccinated unless he is comfortable. He asks should he switch to (Withheld), is that a safer bet, (Withheld), should he just skip it all together or not. He says he knows they are a different type of vaccine. He says they had to remove fluid form his pericardial sac, he had 2 days of draining, they drained a liter from around the heart so it could beat normal again. He says apparently some of the fluid went to the lungs so he needed oxygen. He says this all happened Tuesday morning, he came back home yesterday, he looks pretty good. He says he just wants to do the vaccine and asks should he take the second one or not. He would like to get any information. He says the fluid in his heart was starting to build up on 05Apr2021 or 06Apr2021, he started getting symptoms that come and go. He says he was admitted to the hospital on 19Apr2021 and his procedure was on 20Apr2021 so his shortness of breath resolved the day after the procedure. He says he was hospitalized from 19Apr2021 to 25Apr2021. After reporting shortness of breath he says that was it, basically. He says he went to the nurse treatment center on 19Apr2021 because he thought it might be COVID but this event landed him in the hospital. The events required a visit to emergency room, he said he went to the emergency room on 19Apr2021 and a doctor told him he might not make it. The patient said he was scared and he didn&#39;t know why the doctor would have said that to him. He said he did not have an appointment date to physician office yet, he was waiting to get a call back. Relevant Tests included: Rapid COVID test, Date 07Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at Patient First Result negative, Date 19Apr2021 at the hospital on admittance, Result negative. Standard COVID test, Date 19Apr2021 Result negative, Date 15Apr2021 Result negative. He says at the hospital there was a lot of tests done on his heart and lungs, nothing was coming back scary, they were coming back as perhaps viral markers. The outcome of shortness of breath was recovered on 21Apr2021, of other events was unknown.

A 53-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), at the age of 53-year-old via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: EW0153) at 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history was not reported. The patient received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included famotidine (PEPCID AC).  The patient previously took flu shot in Oct2020, prilosec [omeprazole magnesium] for seasonal allergy and experienced drug hypersensitivity.  The patient experienced unexpected bruising near injection site. Bruise was the size of the bandaid, approximately 1&#34; x 2&#34;. Bruising had persisted for more than a week now. The patient had never experienced bruising like this with other vaccines. He would like to rule out possible thrombosis reaction before second shot. He did not have bruising at any other locations other than the injection site.  Bruise was purple and red splotches and has now progressed to mostly yellow. He believed the discoloration was a reaction to the vaccine and not the result of the needle. The shot itself was painful but patient felt minimal pain/stiffness following the shot. The event start date was on 20Apr2021. No treatment was received. The outcome was unknown.

Breathing issues continues to get worse over time.  Went to urgent care doctor on June 4th.  They said my oxygen level was low and could hear wheezing in chest.  They did a chest x-ray and thought I might have pneumonia.  Gave me antibiotics.  Recommended to see primary care doctor.  Went to HCF on 6/7/2021.  Saw FNP.  She did blood work.  Scheduled me for a cat scan on  6/8.  Blood tests indicated d-dimer level was high.  Cat scan showed pulmonary embolisms in both lungs.  Went to hospital.

A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0183) in the morning between 10:00 and 11:00 am as single dose for covid-19 immunisation at the age of 53-year-old.  Medical history included an open reduction internal fixation, surgery on his right clavicle 5 years ago, which is what made him want to get the vaccine. Concomitant drugs included Multivitamin, Vitamin A and Vitamin D. The patient had an exam in December and all of the test results were normal. On 16May or 17May2021, the patient has experienced redness in thumb and fingertips, numbness, and decreased sensation in left hand, tingling in left hand. Symptoms have been ongoing for 10 days; it has progressively gotten worse. It was reported that the symptoms started 2 days after getting the vaccine on 13May2021, was 16May2021 or 17May2021. He takes multi vitamins and minerals and thought it may be related to that. He takes high doses of Vitamin A and Vitamin D. He actually thought it was due to the Vitamin A and Vitamin D. He stopped the vitamins for a few days. Treatment included: Thought maybe, apart from the vitamins, it may be because he was washing his hands so much that it may be from that. He used Aveno lotion to try and lubricate them. The outcome of event Thrombosis was unknown, outcome of other events was not recovered. The reported considered the events were related to the vaccine as it was the left finger tips, especially the thumb, compared to the right. That&#39;s why he thinks it is related to the vaccine.   The clinical course was reported as: The redness was first, then the tingling. He doesn&#39;t remember the exact day. The numbness and decreased sensation were afterward. He is still experiencing all of these and has gotten worse. The thumb on the left hand looks pink and wrinkled. When comparing the right see the difference tell they are different. Seriousness: Does not really know what it is, it could be thrombosis. The redness in the thumb and finger tips is in the right as well but is not as bad as in the left.   Follow attempts needed. Further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible dose -event relationship post vaccination and no other alternate explanation the causal role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported event of thrombosis.

On day 7, I started coughing so I went to Hospital ER and was admitted. Chest X-ray and CT scan of chests showed pneumonia. The COVID-19 PCR test was again done and was negative. Respiratory panel PCR was negative. Mycoplasma titer was negative. I was given steroid and fever improved. I continued to cough until now (1/30/2021)

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                I went to the ER on 4/17/21.  Had Pulmonary Embolism in both lungs. I was in the hospital 3 days.  I have no personal history of blood clots and no family history of blood clots.  Now I must be on blood thinners the rest of my life, because the science does not know?  I understand from the doctors that 4 out of 1,000,000 cases are happening with the Pfizer vaccine.  Why is this information not being released to the public?  I almost died from the Pfizer vaccine and am not permanently disabled by it.

Patient had just finished working out for about 45 minutes when he noted tightness across his lower chest/epigastric region. Found to be in V tach upon arrival and underwent electrical cardioversion with relief of symptoms. Patient was aspirin loaded and started on heparin and lidocaine drips. He underwent cardiac cath which did not show any hemodynamically significant stenosis. Also underwent cardiac MRI which demonstrated a non-viable transmural infarct of the inferior wall. Etiology of VT was thought to be scar mediated from prior MI. Patient underwent uncomplicated ICD placement and was started on metoprolol. ICD interrogation POD 1 was unremarkable. Patient discharged in stable condition with close follow up with PCP, Cardiology, and EP. Patient with unchanged coronaries and unchanged ejection fraction. Patient received Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine IM on 3/27 (left deltioid - LOT ER8733) and 4/17 (left deltioid - LOT EW0170).

Patient was hospitalized for management of severe sepsis secondary to Covid pneumonia resulting in acute hypoxic respiratory failure.  Patient was also treated for possible secondary bacterial pneumonia given duration of Covid symptoms prior to coming into hospital.  Patient made nice recovery and was able to wean off from high flow oxygen down to 2 L with exertion.  Patient overall made nice recovery hence he was discharged home.   Patient was noted to have rising D-dimers despite clinical improvement in Covid infection.  He is at high risk for developing DVTs hence he was recommended to use Xarelto 10 mg daily for 1 month to prevent any risk of DVTs.   Patient voiced understanding of this.  In he was discharged home with home health care.   His readmission potential is low to moderate.

                                                No immediate adverse reaction, however, began developing nightly fevers/profuse sweating on June 11.  This continued for two weeks with increasing symptoms of loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, tingling sensation on scalp before going to ER.  Visited urgent care on June 16 and bloodwork results indicated elevated white blood cell count and eosinophil count.  There was a question as to whether patient had been subjected to a tick bite, so doxycycline was prescribed.  After several days, patient returned to urgent care for follow-up bloodwork (June 20th).  Results showed WBC and eosinophil count continued to escalate.  He went to ER on June 25th and was admitted to the hospital for 5 days.  During his visit at Hospital, he was seen by a team of specialists:  cardiologist, pulmonologist, hematologist, infectious disease doctor.  Multiple tests were run, as the doctors started broad to eliminate certain diagnoses - i.e., bone marrow biopsy, heart cath, CT scans, x-rays, thoracentesis, etc.  Patient had fluid around his heart and lungs and was diagnosed with myocarditis.  He had no previous heart issues nor family history of heart issues.  Test results indicated no abnormal  blockage or other issues, other than inflammation and his heart strength was at 27%.  I am unable to access his account, as it was disabled after his death.  An autopsy is being performed and results are pending; however, the question(s) at large:  what was the condition of his heart at the time of his death and was this vaccine-related?  Did his myocarditis get worse?  Did his heart muscle weaken further and rupture?    Please let me know if the autopsy results are needed and where to send them.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

There is a small caliber appearance of the aorta and a flattened appearance of the IVC is well. 4. Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6.

                                                Within 5-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported weakness and confusion. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. No signs of stroke. EKG demonstrated NSR, rate 77bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG was 290mg/dl. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. Enroute, the patient became increasingly confused, forgetting their birthday and location. Patient was hypertensive (178/104) and reported a &#34;crushing headache&#34;. EMS crew became concerned for stroke. In ED, the patient remained hypertensive (178/93). ED Physician had high suspicion of TIA versus acute reaction to COVID-19 vaccine. Administerd 650mg acetaminophen and 1mg Lorazepam. Admitted patient to critical care unit where patient stated they had developed a sudden-onset diffuse banding-like headache with associated nausea, diaphoresis, blurry vision, and confusion. MRI was negative and patient was transferred from ICU to hospital. Hospital physician believed the symptoms were likely a vagal mediated response or reaction to his COVID vaccination. Patient was discharged on 3/20 with diagnoses of TIA, Acute encephalopathy, Insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes, Essential hypertension, CAD, Unspecified mood disorder, Dyslipidemia, Obesity, and Mild neuro cognitive disorder

                                                anaphylaxis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiration date unspecified),  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 05Dec2020 11:00 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation; and amoxicillin, clavulanic acid (AUGMENTIN), via an unspecified route of administration from 18Mar2021 at unspecified dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), AV Nodal block, and pacemaker. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Mar2021 20:00, the patient experienced anaphylaxis. The patient was hospitalized for 2 days on an unspecified date due to the event. The patient reported that he was on augmentin on and off for years and when he got his first vaccine. And on 18Mar2021, he began augmentin again and had anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. The patient was asking if this was related to the vaccine, but seems to be a possibility. The event resulted in resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The event was treated with epinephrine, steroids, benadryl, and fluids. There was no other vaccine in 4 weeks and patient had not had Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The action taken in response to the event for amoxicillin, clavulanic acid was unknown. Outcome of event was recovered in 2021.  Information on batch/lot number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, the event anaphylaxis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2. The event occurred more than 3 months after the administration of vaccine and can be attributed to augmentin based on provided information, including close temporal relationship and positive rechallenge.

Then he read an article (he swear, he was not researching anything online) about a 56 year old man who developed ITP days after receiving Pfizer vaccine. since he had Afib this article worried him. He had no idea what blood clots felt like, but he was having sometimes sharp and sometimes dull pains that would last 10-60 seconds throughout her body-calfs, things, forearms, toes, finger and even his stomach.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right. He does not know how to describe it, but he has had metal slivers in his arm in the past and it felt like that, like an infection. He does not know how to describe it. He adds that in his upper right arm inside, he could see all of his veins, like a roadmap. He also had some other things, like his left side of his head rush, like it felt like blood was rushing from the top to left side of his brain. At dinner and meals he had several instances he could barely sit there, he felt like he was going to pass out or spazz out. His limbs felt like they were going to spazz out. In second week, he had several nights where he sweated a lot overnight. The second week into the third week, he did not have the thrashing stuff anymore but for pretty long his heart would go up a notch and/or the heart would be faint. He had diarrhea when he got up. It did not go up to 120, but maybe 80, Headache and pressure at his temples, ears ringing. Left arm pain from injection site. It started with a bang and really hurt. It was really sore and kind of spread into cramping. It was stiff and the source was the injection site. At work, he thought he was having a stroke. His left leg and thigh were stiff and spreading feeling. About 20 minutes after sitting, his legs did not work, and he collapsed. He had Drop foot when his legs got stiff. It took like a week to retrain his arm and leg, like he had a mini stroke. He did therapy for himself and retrained his arm to play guitar. He had a little bit of stiffness in his left arm that comes and goes, stiffness in his left thigh that comes and goes, and his ears are ringing a little bit and it comes and goes. He is not getting second vaccine. He took zinc per his doctor recommendation, but it did not go well. He felt like his arms were roided out or supercharged. He had difficulty/pain breathing in the upper chest, a pretty big at the base of his left index finger red spot like blood collection, and pain in the right thumb base. He had pain in the base of his right foot. Blood tests were in the second week. Glucose was high and he is hypoglycemic. Glucose 117 mg/dl (79-115 normal range), zinc 54 mcg/dl (60-120 normal range), CMV IGG AB &gt;10 u/mL (positive is &gt; or = 0.7 range). The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Pulmonary embolism in his left lung; Chills; Hard to breathe; shaking a lot; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 55-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: EW0164) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Apr2021 at 12:00 (at the age of 55-years-old) as a single dose in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) from an unspecified date and ongoing and urinary tract infection (UTI) from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: first letter is either a G or O but he thought it was OE8732) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Mar2021 at 11:45 (at the age of 55-years-old) as a single dose in the left shoulder for COVID-19 immunisation. Illness at vaccination was UTI.  On 20Apr2021 the patient experienced pulmonary embolism in his left lung, chills, hard to breathe and shaking a lot. The patient was hospitalized for pulmonary embolism in his left lung (blood clot) from 20Apr2021 to 26Apr2021. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient stated that he had the second Pfizer shot on 19Apr2021 and on the 20Apr2021 he had a really bad reaction to it. He had chills, it was hard to breath, he was shaking a lot and had a UTI and COPD and had to call an ambulance to come get him. When he went to the emergency room, they did a CT (computerized tomography) scan of his chest and found a pulmonary embolism in his left lung and he was put on a Heparin drip for 7 days and stayed in the hospital for 7 days. The event hard to breathe ended shortly after he got to the emergency room since he was on oxygen. The patient had a history of COPD, so sometimes he had trouble breathing, but right now he did not. The event shaking a lot ended a little after he got to the emergency room. The patient also stated that he had a history of UTI in the past and had a UTI during the vaccine but was not treated for the UTI until he was at the hospital. The clinical outcomes of the event pulmonary embolism in his left lung was unknown; chills, hard to breathe and shaking a lot were all recovered/resolved on 20Apr2021.

                                                Patient is a 55 y.o. yo male presenting to the ED with fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing and poor appetite per patient&#39;s son-in-law. Patient received Covid vaccine on April 25, 2021 and about 3 days later, started to have symptoms that they thought were just postvaccination symptoms.  Patient was having decreased appetite, fatigue and generally did not look well.  The following week, patient was tested for work and resulted as positive for COVID-19 at that time.  He then presented to the ED on May 8th, was admitted initially to the floor but had progressive decompensation of his hypoxemia and was transferred to the ICU on May 12th. He was intubated and subsequently cannulated for VV ECMO due to hypoxia. He remained on the circuit until 6/26/21 when he was successfully decannulated. He was still ventilator dependent and transferred to LTAC on 7/6. I was just asked by one of his care team members yesterday to submit this case to VAERS as he had no risk factors for such severe COVID disease other then his age of 55. He had normal BMI and no PMH. The concern from staff is that his vaccination may have not only failed to protect the patient, but could have boosted the virus&#39;s ability to infect cells; this concern is based on original vaccine and spike protein trials published back in 2005.

I experienced feeling like I would pass out and my heart not feeling right. I called 911 which their EKG machine showed I was in atrial fibrillation (I have never had before).  I was taken to hospital via ambulance. I converted back to normal sinus rhythm at arrival to the hospital in the ambulance. The cardiac workup did not show anything significant. Followed-up with my cardiologist&#39;s office.

Patient reported that there was a slight discomfort of the arm where the shot was administered (11May2021) - not enough to worry about &amp; expected.  The next morning (12May2021) he felt painful sensations in the lower left leg - sensations similar to stress fractures and palpations. It subsided and has not returned. About three/four days later (reported as 14May2021 18:00) continuing two weeks leading to the second dose - he felt a constant and migrating thrombosis/palpitations on the right side of his head. It was mildly painful - not quite a headache yet persistent and localized to the RT temporal lobe above the temple &amp; slightly above that region. It became exacerbated by critical thinking when it occurred &amp; persisted for long periods of time. The cognitive effect has become slightly debilitating &amp; stressful. No treatment received. The outcome of the event &#39;a slight discomfort of the arm where the shot was administered&#39; was unknown, of the event &#39;painful sensations in the lower left leg&#39; was recovered, of the other events was not recovered.

This is the first report of 2 reports, for the first dose.  A 56-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at age of 56-years, administered in left upper bicep on 26Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes and the patient had it for 10 years or so and was diet controlled, his blood sugars was good. And ongoing supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) for about 4 years and was medication control. And patient was an amputee from an accident many years ago. Concomitant medications included ongoing carvedilol (COREG) taken for SVT.  It was reported that the patient had a brain bleed after the first dose that might be but probably wasn&#39;t related to the vaccine. Event outcomes was unknown.  No follow-up attempts needed. No further information expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021596614 same reporter/patient/drug, different event/dose.

                                                Hemoptysis.  On 06/05, a one-time event (old, dark clots) occurred.  On 06/06, there were several instances, some older clots, some lighter/fresher blood.  Then 4 days of no blood, but &#34;normal&#34; (usual) infected sputum colors (preexisting lung infection; see continuation page).  Then on 06/11 beginning @ 7:57am, fresh (light) blood streaks/tinged sputum, which occurred a number of times over the span of approximately 5 hours, until &#34;normal&#34; pale yellow infected sputum was expectorated.  Then on 06/12 beginning @ 9:30am, fresh blood again, which again occurred a number of times over the span of about 5 hours until the usual infected colors of sputum were expectorated. Additional information for Item 18: I have a history of MAI/MAC infection and resultant hemoptysis since 2006.  However, until the first Pfizer dose, it had been 2 years since the last incident of hemoptysis, which was due, at least in large part, to malnutrition spanning a couple of months, for reasons unrelated to the lungs.  I believe my most recent hemoptysis episodes are a result of my immune system being distracted by the Covid-19 vaccine, thus allowing the Mycobacterium avium (and/or other) to more effectively attack my lung tissue.  There was no hemoptysis yesterday (06/13), but this has me concerned about the second dose causing additional, possibly worse, problems for my immune system, as it needs to be concentrating on my lung infection full-time; it has been keeping the MAC (and/or other) generally under control, assuming hemoptysis is a good indicator, which my X-rays over the years of monotherapy with Ethambutol suggest is the case.  I discontinued Ethambutol on 06/15/2012, with no further hemoptysis until 04/26/2019, and then no hemoptysis until 11 days after the first Pfizer Covid-19 dose. It seems reasonable to conclude that the vaccine led to these latest hemoptysis events and perhaps allowed the preexisting bacterial infection to cause additional lung damage.The physician noted above is my current pulmonologist.  I was to have follow-up lung CT scan and lung function tests, but did not do so in 2020 because of Covid-19 concerns.  I had planned to see Dr. and my other doctors after being fully-vaccinated, but since lung function tests cannot be performed on patients with active/recent hemoptysis, this may cause an even further delay in my obtaining appropriate diagnostics and treatment.

Notes afterward he started with symptoms of a &#39;chest cold&#39; and was having pain in left rib/lung/chest area. One morning walking at work and was noticing increased phlegm and chest congestion, spit up a wad of blood. Sharp left lung pain with taking a deep breath. Notes after episode, coughed up darker blood a few more times. Went to ER on 6/14/21 - imaging  found with pulmonary embolism/blood clot in left lung. Discharged with Eliquis started pack 2 tab BID for 7 days, then 1 tab BID.  New patient consult on 6/16/21 with myself, APRN - continuation of blood thinners initiated, referred for hematology consult, and echocardiogram ordered.

I woke up the next morning, and the crap was worse. I ran some errands and came home and then looked at my calf of my leg and it was twice the size as my other leg. I had four spots of bruising from ankle to knee. I immediately went to the emergency room.    I was hospitalized and had bloodwork and an MRI done which showed that I had a DVT and a pulmonary embolus in my right lung. I was hospitalized for two days on blood thinners. I had no shortness of breath or heart problems during this time. I was then released from the hospital on blood thinners which I have to take for the next six months.

                                                I had my first shot of Pfizer vaccine last Friday morning (March 5). In the evening, I felt fatigued. So I went to sleep early. When I got up Saturday morning, I felt dizzy. The dizziness went away in a few minutes. In the next 36 hours, I had the angina feelings - tightness in the left chest and I felt heart be squeezed occasionally. When I stand up and walk, I felt better. Finally Sunday evening (March 7), I took a walk outside and felt symptom free. Maybe the walk helped, maybe the &#34;thrombosis&#34; had run its course before my walk.   I have not had the severe angina symptoms since my PCI procedure in Feb 2018. I am sure the recent occurrence is related to the vaccine.   Besides reporting the adverse event, I want to get advices whether I should receive the second shot.   Thank you!

A 57-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration, on 25Feb2021 (at the age of 57-years-old), at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The consumer stated she&#39;s asking on behalf of her husband. He received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 25Feb2021 and had Joint pain and chills after that (on unspecified date in 2021) he was diagnosed with Blood clot (unspecified date in 2021); she stated he had no history of similar health issues and wanted to know if it could be directly linked to this vaccine. The wife further reported that it&#39;s dramatically changing his life, he can&#39;t even walk now. He had the Covid vaccine on 25Feb2021 and he has no history of blood clots. He developed a leg pain (on unspecified date in 2021) which was odd and they thought that maybe it was some arthritis or something like that. They went to the orthopedist and he was being treated for what the orthopedist thought was a bakers cyst. But then they discovered it was a very large blood clot from his thigh to his calf. They would like to know about this. They have been looking into what he had experienced, and it seems very unusual. It just seems too coincidental that this happened after the Covid vaccine. The emergency room doctor of course shut them down immediately and said that the Covid vaccine never would have done this. But the patient&#39;s doctor yesterday said that there are too many unknowns to say for sure that the Covid vaccine didn&#39;t cause this. She is not saying that they are against the Covid vaccine, but they are concerned. The patient is on blood thinners now and they just need to know if there is a possible correlation. She had heard on the world news that there is a connection after receiving the (company name) Covid vaccine and now they are shutting this vaccine down in (region name). She saw on the news last night they were asking if there is a correlation with the Pfizer and (company name) Covid vaccines and this. It is very concerning. They have been trying to do research and there is nothing that you can find. The only thing that they did see online was about the doctor that died of a blood disorder in (state name), he had thrombocytopenia. The patient is going to be sent to see a vein doctor. She stated that he has a lot of things ahead of him and he is too young to be dealing with all of this. They are going to be following up with the vein doctor and she would like to have this information when the vein doctor calls later today. The reported adverse events resulted to an emergency room and physician office visit (went to the orthopedist). The patient received corrective treatment as response to the reported events. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 57-year-old male patient received the second dose of  BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 14Jan2021 (at the age of 57 years; as reported) at a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) on 28Dec2020 in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had a stroke on 01Feb2021 at 15:00. The event resulted to  emergency room/department visit and physician office visit but was not given any treatment (as reported). The patient was hospitalized for stroke for 27 days. The event was considered serious, life threatening, and disabling/incapacitating. Patient&#39;s nasal swab test on an unspecified date was negative. The outcome of stroke was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on know n drug profile  it is unlikely that the reported cerebrovascular accident was causally  related to  BNT162B2.  This is probably an intercurrent medical condition.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product and on the conduct of the study are evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

A 57-year-old male patient received BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (at the age of 57-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included joint pain and ongoing 45-packs per year smoker. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included salbutamol (ALBUTEROL), hydroxyzine (manufacturer unknown) and diclofenac sodium (manufacturer unknown). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The physician reported, &#34;patient had anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema on separate hospitalization (I was not involved for this but reviewed photos and this was reportedly attributed to the vaccine; I&#39;m uncertain if that event was reported). On hospitalization, the patient was with small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism on a CT PE (CT scan for Pulmonary Embolus). Patient is an active smoker. No other obvious cause.&#34; As a result of the adverse events (unspecified), the patient was hospitalized for one day. The start date of the events was on 29Mar2021. The patient was treated with apixaban (for pulmonary embolism). The clinical outcome of &#34;anaphylaxis and whole-body rash and erythema&#34; and &#34;small peripheral right lower lobe pulmonary embolism&#34; was resolving.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events pulmonary embolism, anaphylactic reaction and associated generalized rash and generalized erythema. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Patient was found down on 4/25/2021 for an unknown amount of time and EMS was called. Patient noted to be seizing on EMS arrival. Blood glucose was noted to be 32 and an amp of D50 was administered. Patient arrested, received CPR (approximately 1 round) and was intubated in the field. His second glucose reading was undetectable and he received a second amp of D50. Patient also received sodium bicarb, calcium, and epinephrine and transported to ED. Patient subsequently transferred to Medical Center. He was treated for septic shock. His mentation remained very poor after pressors weaned off and sedation stopped. He likely had severe brain injury from hypoglycemia and anoxia - poor brainstem reflexed but did have spontaneous breathing - very poor prognosis - patient was extubated for comfort measures and all interventions stopped after family discussion and per their plan.

On 23Mar2021, the patient experienced event COVID-19 and pneumonia (COVID-19 pneumonia, hospitalization, medically significant).On 23Mar2021, 1 year 7 months 23 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to COVID-19 and pneumonia and discharged on 29 Mar 2021. The patient was on oxygen at the time of reporting. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose for the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was unknown.The reporter did not provide causality for the event of COVID-19 pneumonia. Follow-up information was received as solicited report on 15Apr2021 from a consumer via (pharmacy name). On 06Apr2021, the patient had pneumonia (pneumonia, medically significant and hospitalized). Additional lot number and expiration date were added to 2.5 mg concentration of PO Orenitram. On 06Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 6 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient was also hospitalized in Mar2021 for COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Action taken with PO Orenitram dose for the event of pneumonia was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event of pneumonia was unknown. The reporter did not provide causality for the event of pneumonia. Additional spontaneous information was received on 19Apr2021 from a consumer (social worker) via (pharmacy name). Event of pneumonia was omitted and subsumed under COVID-19 pneumonia. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Follow-up information was received on 27Apr2021, from a nurse on behalf of the reporting physician via a query response. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On an unreported date in 2021, the patient had fever, temperature 101.1 F (pyrexia). On an unreported date, the patient had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) (mitral valve incompetence, medically significant), steroid induced diabetes (steroid diabetes, medically significant), lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs (oedema peripheral), weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs (weight fluctuation), rash (rash), diarrhea (diarrhoea), and leg healing (limb discomfort). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia) and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F in 2021. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID-19 swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight in Apr 2021 since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea, and limb discomfort. Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded. Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities. Information on the batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known safety profile, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drug ineffective, COVID-19, pneumonia, rash, pyrexia and diarrhoea cannot be excluded. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was secondary to COVID-19, therefore was also considered as related to BNT162B2. The other events were considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2. Steroid diabetes was considered as related to methylprednisolone and other events were unrelated to methylprednisolone. Oedema peripheral and limb discomfort were considered as related to nifedipine and other events were unrelated to nifedipine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, ci 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. In 2021, the patient experienced had fever, temperature 101.1 F. On an unknown date, the patient experienced had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation), steroid induced diabetes, lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs, weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs, rash, diarrhea, and leg healing (limb discomfort). In 2021, patient weight was up by 4 lbs since discharge from hospital. The action for nifedipine in response to the events was unknown. The action for methylprednisolone in response to the events was unknown. The action for treprostinil diolamin in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events COVID-19 pneumonia, drug ineffective, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia , and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, events of COVID-19 pneumonia, Drug ineffective, Fever, Diarrhea could be related to the suspected drug of BNT162B2. All the other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  The reported events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Nifedipine.  The events of Diabetes steroid-induced is most likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus. All the other events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Medrol.   Medical history of ongoing Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH/ High BP disorder/ increased pressure of pulmonary circulation), ongoing Systemic lupus erythematosus, and ongoing Dyspnoea may provide explanations for some of the events (such as Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Volume overload, Mitral regurgitation, and Oedema peripheral).   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                My father in law suffered a heart attacked on the day he received his second shot. at the time of this he was staying in our house where he wasn&#39;t found until two days later when we received a call from his work saying he never showed up or called in to work. The medical examiner told us that prior to the second vaccine in the last few weeks he had suffered some sort of heart issue that damaged his heart, but wasn&#39;t big enough for him to notice or think anything of it. The timeline the medical examiner gave us would have been after receiving the first vaccine. He then received his second Vaccine on a Thursday which was the last time anyone heard from him and he didn&#39;t show up to work Friday and was found Saturday after we were notified he didn&#39;t show up to work and we called 911. The medical examiner said he suffered a heart attack. The medical examiner said they had to write the death date on Saturday because that was when he was found, but the last anyone heard of him was prior to getting the vaccine and then he missed work the very next day(which was Friday).

A 58-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Feb2021 17:30 (at the age of 57-years-old) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 on 02Feb2021and experienced cardiac blockage. The patient did not take any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 15Apr2021 the patient experienced a blook clot, blockage in the left anterior descending artery and symptoms of shortness of breath. The events were reported as serious (life threatening). It was reported that 15Apr2021, emergency trip to ER, blockage in the Left Anterior Descending artery.  This blockage was only 40% blocked in Feb2021, and suddenly in April became 99% blocked. Dr suspected a blook clot when symptoms of shortness of breath appeared suddenly. The events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care.

                                                After the second dose my chest started to feel very tight at first. Yet, it progressed to my right calf. I  was experiencing very severe pain in my right calf. I thought the pain will eventually go away yet it still continued. About three weeks after my second dose, May 24th, I drove myself to a local clinic, and they directed me to the emergency room to get a X-Ray of my right calf. They found a blood clot. The doctors bandaged my calf and prescribed me Xarelto to treat the pain. In addition to the prescription, they directed me to a Vascular doctor to documented the recovery. As of now it is unclear if the blood clot is completely gone, however, my calf is still swollen. In addition to that, my little toe and the heel of my right foot is numb to any sensations.

                                                About 4 days after second shot, I noticed I had bumps on by back side.   They did not itch.   I though they were from bike riding - chafing.    But they moved around.   10 days after, my lip started to swell pretty badly while I was in a meeting.   Got online with doctor was told to go to hospital.  Anaphylaxis was the diagnosis.    They gave standard care - steroids, antihistamine, pepcid, etc.    Issue went away including the bumps on behind.    Was told to go my doctor. Went to my doctor.   Said dont worry, likely will not come back again.   Just a reaction of some type.      Next night lip swelled up - other side of mouth.  Online doctor said to go emergency room.    Back to emergency same treatment - more steroids, pecid, antihistamine.   Back  to my doctor and he sends me to alergist.   I have never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life.   Allergist said the reaction is due to the covid shot and making my immune system go crazy.   He put me on regimen of pepcid and antihistamine.    Seems to work for about a week - but then the hives came back.   More swelling of the face (lips, eyes) but none bad enough to go to hospital.    Taking meds 3 to 4 times a day (pepcid and antihistamine).     Had swelling in the ankle which the doctor said basically hives gone crazy.   Then the hives got worse - and itching.   Covered most of my body.    The hives on the bottom of the feet felt like walking on air pillow packaging material.    Dr puts me back on steroids.    Go through this process twice with steroids.    Dr said we would have to go the route of Xolair.   Received first injection three weeks ago.    But after shot had bad hives again with itching this time  - more steroids.     Then things sort of leveled out - still had hives but not a large - and no itching _ thank goodness.     But then on 7-2-21 I woke up with severe swelling of the face - and into the throat.    Had difficulty swallowing.    Back to emergency room again - more shots and Epinephrine.     They prescribe more steroids and epi pen just in case because the reaction was so severe.    Second shot of Xolair is in one more week - hopefully gets things under control.

A 58-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech COVID vaccine), intramuscularly on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Concomitant medication included hypertension medications in two weeks. The patient was presumed neg covid status prior to vaccine. He worked as a Pulm/critical care physician. He reported fever, myalgia, fatigue on 16Dec2020. Next day (17Dec2020), he took off from work due to his symptoms. The following day (18Dec2020), he came to work. He c/o ongoing severe fatigue &amp; hand weakness in am. Staff noted him to be evaluating his hands during clinic. At 12:15, he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis. The reporter had suspicion for stroke. He was transported to the Emergency Room (ER), head CT showed Rt basal ganglia hemorrhage w/ edema and mass effect. Labs notable for Low platelets, 114 (unknown baseline) on 18Dec2020, normal coags on an unspecified date. BP recorded as 179/101, but it was noted in trauma room his bp as high as 200s/100. He had a history of hypertension with reported med noncompliance in the last few months due to stress. Patient was transferred for further care. Full course was unknown but had rebleed there with low plts. Adverse event (he collapsed with left sided hemiparesis) resulted in hospitalization (22 days), life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), disability/incapacitating or permanent damage. Treatment was received for adverse events. Results of tests and procedures for investigation of the patient: on 18Dec2020, Nasal Swab test: negative. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Unknown if any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient was not tested for COVID-19.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Collapsed with left sided hemiparesis/suspicion for stroke are as consequences of basal ganglia hemorrhage with edema, which is caused by worsening of hypertension.  Low platelet also contributes to brain hemorrhage. All these serious events are unrelated to the vaccine use.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

A 58-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 10Mar2021 at 16:30 (batch/lot number: EN6208) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation (wanted the protection). Medical history included deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from Jul2018 and ongoing. No family medical history relevant to the adverse events. Concomitant medication included warfarin taken for maintenance level for history of DVT from Aug2020 and ongoing. The patient experienced DVT in right leg on 02Apr2021, swelling in right leg on 15Mar2021 and discomfort in right leg while walking on 15Mar2021. The patient reported that he had a reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and he believes that it was directly related to the COVID-19 vaccine. He reported that he has a history of blood clots in his right leg going back to 2018. He reported that his most recent DVT was in Aug2020 and he was cleared in Nov2020. He reported that he received the COVID-19 vaccine on 10Mar2021. He reported that on 15Mar2021, he started to notice his right leg swelling. He reported that he called his physician on 29Mar2021 and that his physician ordered an ultrasound. He reported that he had the ultrasound on 02Apr2021 and a deep vein thrombosis was found again. Swelling in right leg: he reported that the swelling has gone down. He reported that the reason that he mentioned that he has a history of blood clots was because of his warfarin dosage. He reported that he was first diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis in Jul2018. He reported that he went through that cycle and that his maintenance level of warfarin was maybe 10 or 12 mg of warfarin per day. He reported that he had another deep vein thrombosis in Aug2020, and since Aug2020 he has been on 17 mg of warfarin daily. He reported that the blood level on warfarin maintenance was supposed to be between 2 and 2.5. He reported that now because of the deep vein thrombosis he experienced in Aug2020, his doctor wanted his level to be at 2.5 to 3.5. He stated that he doesn&#39;t think that at that blood level for his warfarin that he should have gotten a blood clot. He reported that something compromised or interfered with the warfarin, resulting in a deep vein thrombosis. Discomfort when walking: he reported that it feels like his leg was compressing. He reported that the discomfort seems to have gotten better. He was queried for details of warfarin prescription. He reported that the 10 or 12 mg warfarin tablets that he had been taking when the blood clot was diagnosed in Aug2020 have been consumed and he no longer has the bottle. He reported that he did not have the bottle with him for his current warfarin prescription. He reported that the warfarin was not auto-refilled by the pharmacy. He reported that the warfarin was only prescribed a week or two at a time. Investigations: he reported that since Aug2020 when the deep vein thrombosis returned, he started doing self INR tests at home. He reported that he constantly self-monitors his INR at home and his levels were consistently at 3.0 to 3.1. He reported that he monitors his INR at least once a week, sometimes twice a week depending on how he feels. He reported that sometimes his INR goes over 4 and he can feel it. He reported that his system was a little off when it feels too high so he knows how to adjust. He reported that he last checked his INR today, 15Apr2021, and that it was 4.0. He reported that he typically checks his INR on Wednesday. He reported that he keeps a log of his INR levels. He reported that he did not see his physician on 29Mar2021, but that he called his physician and his physician wrote a prescription for the caller to get an ultrasound. Vaccination facility type was pharmacy. Vaccine was not administered at military facility. The adverse events did not require a visit to the emergency room and physician office.

A 58-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in Arm Right on 04Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6203) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE, dose 2, administered in Arm Left on 04Mar2021 (Lot Number: EP6955) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included Stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma, Shellfish (rash), Peanuts (rash) and rash. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication(s) included cetuximab; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN); atorvastatin; cholecalciferol; levothyroxine.  The patient experienced large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade physiology on 01Apr2021. Malignancy and infection were ruled out by cytology which showed only mesothelial cells; cultures were negative. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Pericardiocentesis treatment received. The patient hospitalized for 6 days. The patient underwent nasal swab COVID test negative on 08May2021. The outcome was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Reported &#39;large pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade physiology&#39;, occurred 28 days after bnt162b2 vaccination, is considered unrelated to bnt162b2 but more likely an intercurrent medical condition. Patient&#39;s underlying malignancy, concurrent medical condition for which levothyroxine was administered, concomitant medication cetuximab may have contributed to reported event.

                                                On April 30, 2021, I received the 2nd dose of the COVID-19 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine which was 3 weeks after receiving the 1st dose. Then on May 3rd, I experienced pronounced shortness-of-breath while at work lifting objects up to 20 lbs and walking short distances of 20 to 40 m on flat ground. Then on May 4th, 2021, I went into a nearby Urgent Care Clinic (UCC) with shortness-of-breath and exertional dyspnea as the main symptoms.  At the UCC blood tests were done along with EKG and chest x-ray. Blood tests revealed several results that were not within standard ranges: troponin (1.25 ng/mL), BNP (5130 pg/mL), D-dimer (1320 ng/mL FEU), and C-reactive protein (75.5 mg/L). I was told that I had congestive heart failure and NSTEMI. UCC then directed me to go to the Emergency Department (ED) at a nearby hospital.   In the ED, more tests were done: EKG, CT scan chest (no blood clots were found in the lungs), and cardiac ultrasound (estimated ejection fraction 40-45%). That evening I was transferred to the main hospital for further observation and tests. Not much happened on May 5th and I was not seen by a doctor until 5pm. Then early in the morning of May 6th, I experienced chest pain which lasted between 5 and 10 minutes. I was given oral nitroglycerine. My primary care physician (PCP) and a cardiologist elected to move forward with an angiogram. On May 6th, I underwent cardiac catheterization (CC). The CC report states: (a) 2nd Diag lesion is 50% stenosed (b) Mid RCA to Dist RCA lesion is 80% stenosed,(c) RV branch lesion is 80% stenosed, (d) RPDA lesion is 80% stenosed. Likely spontaneous coronary artery dissection of the mid to distal RCA and postal to mid PDA status post PCI with 2 Xience drug-eluting stents.   Post-angiogram&#43;angioplasty tests were done, including carotid artery ultrasound (results within normal limits. No hemodynamically significant stenoses) and MRI brain (punctate foci of restricted diffusion in both cerebral hemispheres. Multiple vascular distributions w/o larger territorial infarct suggest emboli). Other blood test results were: antinuclear antibody (ANA) IFA screen (positive), BNP (8631 pg/mL). I was released from the hospital on May 8, 2021. Follow-up care included cardiac rehab therapy and consultations with the cardiologist, PCP, a neurologist and rheumatologist. Incidentally, 12 days after the angiogram and angioplasty, I experienced temporary numbness and loss of movement in my right arm which lasted no more than a minute, indicative of a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Root cause investigations focusing on SCAD and TIA are on-going.

                                                On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down st.  On day 04 After receiving the 2nd Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced a deep pain in my upper inner right thigh around 0600 am of the 16th of January. At the same time my calf muscle of that same right leg was in pain.  I thought it to be muscular pain as I was told by the reading material regarding symptoms of the covid 19 vaccine there could be aches an pains attributed to the 2nd shot.  I used a deep heating rub on both areas of my right leg and put heat on them to treat the soreness.  This occured over the next few days feeling this pain in my right leg and treated the same way applying heat. Within about 24 hours of the pain in my legs I started experiencing a shortness of breath while walking up and down stairs as part of my daily activities.  The symptoms of shortness of breath only seemed to appear when I was on any form of extended walking activity or physical movements or exercise this would of have been starting around the 17th of January.  The right leg pain was masked by the heating rub while the shortness of breath continued for the next few days.  On the 19th of January,  I went to an Urgent Care Facility at 0800 am to see a Medical professional to discuss my symptoms I was previously experiencing and to figure out why I was having a shortness of breath and the pain in my right leg.  The on staff Physician&#39;s Assistant had a Nurse conduct a Covid 19 Rapids test (negative) and a second swab was administered and sent to the Lab.  Which produced a (negative for Covid 19) on the 20th of January.  An Xray was not taken to determine my shortness of breath.  The Dr listened to my lungs and heart,  though I did let the PA know I had received both Pfizer shots and when they were administered.  I was carrying My Shot record for the vaccine with the dates and lot number.   He didnt appear to be interested in further diagnosis and made sure I had the paperwork to track the results of my Covid swab sent to the lab. The visit was completed and I was released to go back to work/home.    I carried on the symptoms of the shortness of breath from the 19th of January to the 22nd of January monitoring my O2 (oxygen levels) with a pulse oximeter.  They ranged from 90-93.  On the evening of the 22nd of January I was becoming very uncomfortable with my breathing climbing the stairs in my home and monitored my O2 readings with the oximeter on my finger when walking upstairs and they dropped down to 60-65.  My wife drove me to the emergency room at Hospital.  I walked into the ER and checked myself in for shortness of breath and leg pain in my right leg.  I was admitted into the emergency room and put on 15 litres of oxygen.  The emergency room Dr ordered a chest Xray,  Cat Scan of my chest and heart and a sonogram of my right leg.  The testing results came back with a noted large pulmonary emboli on my lungs/heart area and blood clots throughout my right leg (right lower extremity DVT).    Surgery was performed to remove the pulmonary emboli and I was put on a Heprin Drip to thin out my blood for the remaining clots in my chest and my right leg. The attending physician ordered a T.E.E. (transesophageal Echocardiogram) to observe my heart functions.  I was told the TEE did not demonstrate any further recommend surgeries.  I was administered a test for my cardio and heart functions prior to my discharge on 27 January 2021.   I was prescribed Eloquis for maintenance medication to be monitored by followup visits to my cardiologist and Hemotologist within the next few weeks.  I have not family or personal history of Blood Clots.  I do perform administrative duties as part of my job, which requires sitting and working on a computer.  Note however I move around very often during a work day and operate a farm tractor and have an active life style.  I have not recently had any extended trips more than 2 hours nor have I flown within the past year or so.

I then received a second dose (Lot # EN6206) on 3/13/21.  Over that weekend the pain in my leg grew worse and the leg began to swell. on 3/15, I went to my primary care physician who said it looked like a blood clot. He sent me to a radiologist for an ultrasound (?) of the leg. After confirming the clot, I went to a local ER. They started me on Eliquis to treat the clot

Underwent multiple tests including CAT scan, when no sign of bleed stroke confirmed.  At admittance, Stroke Scale score = 4.  By 3PM, speech started to return, and continued to return.  Continued tests with EEG, EKG, and TTE, but no source for TIA could be pinpointed. Unable to perform MRI due to embedded medical device. By next morning speech had almost returned to normal.  No physical restrictions noted on following day.  Discharged 6PM on 8 April.  Doctors unable to explain cause and could not comment on whether related to receiving vaccine a week prior.

Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 59-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ER8732) at the age of 59-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Mar2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. He has no known allergies and has COVID prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included metoprolol, rosuvastatin, oxybutynin, and tamsulosin. There were no other vaccines in four weeks and no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient reported that he was having some wild effects from the vaccine and did not know what to do. On 26Mar2021 at 15:00, he was having neuropathy like effects. His hands, arms, legs, and feet were experiencing pain and burning sensations, they were burning like nerve damage; he also has a little burning sensation in his nose and cheeks. He has never had this before. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. He was also having some weird sensations in his calf muscles, these sensations started within the past week and a half (Apr2021) which prompted physician office visit. The physician placed him on gabapentin 100 mg to start from 12Apr2021, but it was not enough, it was titrated up to 300 mg, three times a day and he is scheduled to see specialist soon. The patient mentioned that this vaccine has ruined his health. He also went to an urgent care center because his leg was bothering him, it was swelling on an unspecified date in 2021; he thought he had a blood clot; they did some kind of test where they looked at the leg and did not find anything. He didn&#39;t have a particular question. He would just like to talk to someone to see if this was going on with anyone else, if it will go away, or if this was permanent problem he will have. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. He received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0161), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 13Apr2021 at 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Hospital inserted stent. Spoke with all of the Cardiologists about my concerns as Heart problems ?Do not? run in my family. I have always had excellent blood pressure and low cholesterol....my father is 86 and was a smoker, and never been on blood pressure medication, same with my late Grandfather. I?ve ?never? had any type of chest pains in my life. Also, I am retired military and have had numerous vaccines, with no issues. The hospital cardiologists said that I could report this, but they believe the Heart attack is due to the fact that I smoke....I just don?t believe that....the Heart Attack occurred 36 hours after my second vaccine!!!

Found to be pancytopenic with bone marrow biopsy consistent with MDS.  He was started on chemo but stay was complicated by neutropenic fevers, epistaxis, retinal hemorrhage, AKI, fluid overload, hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with RVR, and shock.  He ultimately had a heart attack while admitted and was transitioned to comfort care after medical interventions could not stabilize hemodynamics.

                                                Patient states that he has had 2 heart attacks and 4 blood clots since second dose of covid vaccine. He was treated at the Hospital for the first Heart attack and at another hospital for his second heart attack. He does not have a PCP and was seen by a Physician at the Hospital for his first heart attack and is being seen by a doctor at the other hospital. I tried to contact the doctor&#39;s office and have not been able to get any more information. I talked to a representative at VAERS on 7/2 to see what to do. She stated to just send what I had and you would contact the patient if you need more information.

                                                The day after my second immunization, I began feeling extremely fatigued.  The extreme fatigue continued until June 14, 2021, when I went to my doctor.  The VA doctor indicated that it could be related to a heart issue.  Testing confirmed an abnormal ECG with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  I was given a prescription for blood pressure medication and sent a heart monitor to wear for two weeks.  I have never had any issue prior to the second immunization with my heart.  I had an EKG last year as part of a routine examination and my heart was deemed at that time to be absolutely normal.  I am still having issues with extreme fatigue that has not improved with time.
