He had been inactive prior to 6/22 and it was hot day. He developed leg pain that evening and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis with a CK of 21,980. Patient was hospitalized for IV fluids and since then his CK has been down trending and his leg pain has now resolved.

We walked around the store, conversed, and 10-12 minutes after injection he had syncope and generalized tonic clonic seizure for minutes. We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

                                                Date of Admission: 6/19/2021 Date of Death: 6/20/2021  Primary Care Physician: No primary care provider on file.   REASON FOR ADMISSION: Patient is a 13-year-old previously healthy male who was admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ROSC after CPR for 15 minutes in the field, found to be in the context of large cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to brain lesion (AVM vs tumor).   BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was intubated prior to arrival to the ED. Upon arrival he was started on epinephrine and norepinephrine drips to maintain perfusion and was administered bicarbonate x2. Head CTA was obtained and was notable for midbrain hemorrhage and tonsillar herniation, and no contrast enhanced blood flow in the brain.   Brain death exams were completed at 09:59 and 14:20. APNEA test was performed at 13:30, which is the official time of brain death.  Official cause of death was brainstem herniation from intracranial hemorrhage.    Mechanical ventilation was continued to allow family time to grieve and perform last rites. Time of cardiac death after mechanical ventilation withdrawal was 18:36.     HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:   FEN/Renal/Endo:  #Central DI He received 1.5 L of normal saline bolus in the ED and an additional 3 L of ringers lactate bolus overnight in the ICU to maintain perfusion and decrease heart rate.  His sodium was 141 upon presentation but reached a maximum of 160 due to central diabetes insipidus. He was started on 0.45% normal saline at 100 mL/hr to improve hypernatremia, which was monitored Q1h until normonatremic.  He additionally required vasopressin drip to be started due to central DI, which was increased to a maximum of 20 mU/kg/hr.    CV: At time of admission, epinephrine was running at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and norepinephrine was 0.1 mcg/kg/hr. Norepinephrine was increased shortly thereafter to 0.12 mcg/kg/min.   In the morning after admission, he had tachycardia to the 190s, which appeared to be narrow complex. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were discontinued. Two doses of adenosine were administered (6 mg first dose, 12 mg second dose) due to suspected SVT. The rate decreased for ~4 seconds after the second dose however returned to ~180. EKG arrived which showed sinus tachycardia so no further medications or cardiac interventions were done.  Fluid rates were increased to 2x MIVF rate and additional 500 mL bolus of LR was administered.   Norepinephrine and epinephrine were restarted and escalated due to low blood pressures in the early afternoon.to allow family time with patient.  Both titrated to effect.   Pulm: Patient was mechanically ventilated to achieve normal pH, normocarbia, and high arterial oxygen tension per brain death protocol.  He had no primary pulmonary disease during this admission.   Neuro:  #Intraparenchymal hemorrhage #Tonsillar herniation Neurosurgery was consulted. Mannitol x1 and hypertonic saline 23% x1 were administered to decrease intracranial pressures. Keppra 2g was administered for seizure prophylaxis. No sedation was needed during patient&#39;s hospitalization.

Dose #2 recieved June 17th, 2021. 6/26/21 2:00pm Grand Mal seizure (Full body convulsions, foaming at the mouth, eyes twitching and rolled back/up. Postictal immediately following seizure activity for roughly 10-15 minutes)  on June 26th, 2021, with no history of seizures or any other comorbidities. Resulted in an ER visit on 6/26/21. MRI and EEG ordered for testing. Lab worked ordered on 7/8/21. Rescue medication ordered in the event that he has another seizure. Outcomes: EEG showing absence seizure activity however that remains undetermined at this time due to the fact that the patient never displayed any physical evidence of an absence seizure during the test as he remained alert, responsive followed directions and was able to recall information, during the part of the test that displayed absence seizure activity. MRI: No acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Referral to pediatric neurologist.

Presented to ED at 12:00 AM on 6/17 and subsequently transferred to Pediatric ICU due to elevated troponin and d-dimer.  Initial EKG showed tachycardia. Cardiologist consulted. He had an echocardiogram on 6/17 AM that showed mildly depressed LV systolic function with EF ~58%. Troponin was elevated from 2.9 to 16.9. Due to echo and elevation in troponin patient received 100 gm IVIG (max dose based on  IBW). Has required one dose of 15 mg ketorolac IV and 650 mg acetaminophen PO x1 for chest pain. At 1:00 PM on 6/17, troponin increased to 54.6 and aspirin 81 mg started. Chest x-ray showed borderline cardiomegaly. On 6/18 repeat echocardiogram with normalized LVEF and considered a normal echocardiogram per cardiologist.

In the 1-2 days following the vaccine he experienced fatigue, body aches, and fever to Tmax 101F. Family treated this with anti-pyretics. On 6/18 he started having a pain in his left chest. He was again febrile at that time. On the day of admission his chest pain was worse and he was experiencing pain all over his body.   He was noted to be tachycardic in the ED. His initial labs showed a modestly elevated BNP to 593 with a markedly elevated troponin to 1233. CRP was mildly elevated at 3.8. Electrolytes were unremarkable as were LFTs. CBC w/ diff showed an absolute lymphopenia with ALC of 1000 but was otherwise unremarkable. D-Dimer was normal. He was admitted initially to hospital medicine and then was transferred to the ICU due to concern for risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia. An echocardiogram done showed trace mitral regurgitation but was otherwise normal with normal LV function. CXR was fairly unremarkable. Coags are normal. Repeat electrolytes showed a slight bump in his creatinine. LFTs largely unchaged and procalcitonin of 0.16.    He does have a past medical history of PCR proven COVID-19 disease in December 2020.

                                                Pt is a 15 y.o. with a history of chest pain here today for evaluation. He is an ex 29 weeker with no long term consequences of prematurity.     Pt has been in his usual state of health until he developed intermittent chest pain x a few weeks. Pt had a URI for which he wasn&#39;t sure if it was allergies or a cold in April 2021.  He did receive Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine (First dose 5/16/21 and 2nd dose 6/6/21). Pt came to cardiology for echo for chest pain on 6/22/21. Echo showed pericardial effusion. Pt feel that he had chest pain before the vaccine, but Mom feels like it may have no started until after the first vaccine. Pt is quite active in basketball without issues. The pain lasts for a few minutes and is on his left side radiating down. He did notice that the pain worsened in certain positions, especially while lying down. There is no history of syncope, dyspnea, cyanosis, or heart palpitations. On 6/29, Pt was still having intermittent chest pain.

On Wednesday 6/30 he had his second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. There after he had headache, tactile fever, fatigue and myalgias which resolved by Friday 7/2. On Friday at midnight, he awoke with 7/10 sharp substernal chest pain, non radiating. No recent trauma to the chest. He took Tylenol at home which did not relieve the pain.  No recent URI sx over the last month. The last time he remembers having URI sx was 1.5 years ago. He does endorse &#34;one or two sneezes&#34; over the past month, which he attributes to allergies.  Today 7/3, he presented to urgent care center where he got an EKG, which was concerning for ST elevations. He was given ASA which did not relieve the pain. He was sent to hospital for further work up where he had a Troponin to 1.59, CRP to 36, AST to 79, ALT to 64, Alkphos to 74, BNP to 119, ESR to 10, and WBC to 13.4.  EKG showed ST elevation in I, II, precordial leads V4 V5 V6. CXR wnl. He was given IV toradol at hospital, which alleviated his CP. He was transferred to ED for further evaluation.  On arrival to the ED on 7/3, he was HDS afebrile, with BP 111/69, HR of 80, and satting 100% on RA. His CP had resolved to a level of 0/10. Additional labs were obtained including repeat CBC (with WBC 10K, Hgb of 14), normal ESR of 20, normal D-dimer of less than 0.27, BMP wnl, elevated LFTs with AST 103, ALT of 61, elevated LDH to 293, normal GGT and alk phos, normal BNP to 28, elevated CRP to 3, and an extremely elevated troponin of 3.15. NP swab for COID, Influenza A/B, and RSV were negative. CXR wnl but did note findings consistent with degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 8 doses. His chest discomfort improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which did not show any cardiac dysfunction. His troponin downtrended while on IV steroids, therefore he was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were continuing to trend down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional NSVTs/PVCs; he was started on Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily to prevent arrhythmias after discharge. He was discharged home with a Holter monitor to be worn for 4 days. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.   Of note, CXR from 7/3 with incidental findings suspicious for degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine. This should be followed  by his primary care physician as an out patient.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily (for prevention of NSVT)  - Prednisone 30mg BID (myocarditis)  - Famotidine 20mg daily (while on steroids)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Cardiac MRI (7/7): ?

Two days prior to presentation to Harbor ER on 7/1/2021 he had nausea and  vomiting with a fever 101F on day of presentation. He was found to be in congestive heart failure with severely diminished biventricular function. While inpatient he had worsening respiratory status requiring CPAP and O2 though he improved with initiation of diuresis.  His inflammatory markers were not elevated and he had negative troponins. cMRI revealed an LVEF 13% with no signs of active myocarditis. Viral studies were negative and there was no evidence of bacterial infection. Prior to this, he was in his USOH with no limitations. He was seen in cardiology clinic 5/2021 and was stable at that time.  He required initiation of diuretics and oral heart failure management and was discharged with close follow-up.

A 15-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0173 F) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Jun2021 as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing known allergy in mosquito bite (sketter syndrome) an allergic reaction to mosquito bites, as his son has grown up it has become less and less relevant. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Dose:01 Lot number: EW0171 Anatomical Location: Arm left) on 17May2021 for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, was the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient been tested for COVID-19. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations dates of birth or immunizations are not available. It was reported that my son traveled on 16May2021. Covid test prior traveling negative. On Jun2021, 4 days after vaccination develop GI, heavier insomia, dierrea, vomiting, fever, hypotensive, dehydraeted. On 11Jun2021 experienced pericardial effusion. On an unknown date Jun2021, developed into MISC and was intubated. The patient was hospitalized from 14 Jun 2021 to 6 Jul 2021. Treatment was received. On 15Jun2021, admission at (withheld), (Hidratation IV and IVIGs). On 16Jun2021 condition worsen and Intubated in (withheld). On 17Jun2021, transfer to (withheld) (7 days at PICU, another 7 at pediatrics). On Jun2021, developed a strong insomnia and headache. Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event was MISC protocol IVIGsAnakinra, esteroids and others. On an unknown date, Patient said he had 4 vaccines. His son spent 7 days in the ICU and 7 days in the pediatric unit was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Reported that other researchers studying MIS-C in children have seen how the epithelium cells in the intestine become loose, then the protein goes through the blood stream and can start a cytokine storm and asked if we have studies regarding how much S protein is being produced by different age groups; can it be checked how much S protein is going into the bloodstream to see adverse effects of the vaccine and stated he needs more data to see if his son was possibly infected with Covid during his vaccination period or what he previously infected and absolutely asymptomatic. Most MIS-C occurs 4-6 weeks after having Covid. States that for his son to travel he had to have antigen testing, which was negative. His son did well until 3-4 days after the second shot. States at that time his son became ill with vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and insomnia. She took her son to the hospital and they found him to be hypotensive and dehydrated. They started intravenous fluids and their protocols; the hospital did not have all the required medications for their son and recommended he be transferred to (withheld) Hospital. He was very tired and they decided to put him on ventilation for the ambulance drive. States that when they arrived in (withheld), his son was placed in ICU where he was on the ventilator for 5 days, the recuperating for 2 more days. His son was then moved throughout the hospital system until his discharge yesterday. His son&#39;s insomnia may have started before he left for the (withheld). States that it was worsened after the vaccine, his son mentioned after his hospitalization that he was actually given 4 shots the day he got his vaccines, assumed it to be some kind of delirium from his son being in the ICU for so long, stated he told his son that was not possible that he got 4 vaccines at once because of the paperwork you have to fill out to get the vaccine, the lady at the vaccination site told him to sit down and then gave shothim four shots. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG and IgM resulted as positive on 15Jun2021, PCR resulted as negative on 15Jun2021 Nasal Swab, PCR resulted as positive on 17Jun2021 Nasal Swab. The clinical outcome of the event developed MIS-C and was intubated, vomiting, dierrea, headache, insomnia, hypotensive, dehydrated on an unknown date 2021 was resolved and the event pericardial effusion, develop GI, fever was resolving, the event condition worsen, Vaccination failure, patient said he had 4 vaccines and PCR resulted as positive on 17Jun2021 Nasal Swab was unknown; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, the causal association between the event Insomnia, Diarrhea, vomiting, fever, Drug ineffective, COVID-19, Headache, overdose and the suspect drug cannot be excluded. Also, there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, Pericardial effusion, Gastrointestinal inflammation, Condition worsened, Hypotensive, Dehydration and the suspect drug cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and investigators, as appropriate.
