We walked around the store, conversed, and 10-12 minutes after injection he had syncope and generalized tonic clonic seizure for minutes. We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

On 6/15, continued to have these symptoms then developed abdominal pain and vomited once.  Symptoms persisted on 6/16; then developed chest pain at 11:00PM and reported that pain seemed worse when inhaling and was sharp, shooting pain. Presented to ED at 12:00 AM on 6/17 and subsequently transferred to Pediatric ICU due to elevated troponin and d-dimer.  Initial EKG showed tachycardia. Cardiologist consulted. He had an echocardiogram on 6/17 AM that showed mildly depressed LV systolic function with EF ~58%. Troponin was elevated from 2.9 to 16.9. Due to echo and elevation in troponin patient received 100 gm IVIG (max dose based on  IBW). Has required one dose of 15 mg ketorolac IV and 650 mg acetaminophen PO x1 for chest pain. At 1:00 PM on 6/17, troponin increased to 54.6 and aspirin 81 mg started. Chest x-ray showed borderline cardiomegaly. On 6/18 repeat echocardiogram with normalized LVEF and considered a normal echocardiogram per cardiologist.
