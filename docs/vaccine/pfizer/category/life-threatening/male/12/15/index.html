                                                Patient received the vaccine and was completely fine immediately following. We walked around the store, conversed, and 10-12 minutes after injection he had syncope and generalized tonic clonic seizure for minutes. We were transported 911 to Hospital ED where he had normal labs, normal brain MRI, and consultation with Peds Neuro. He was post-ictal for 30&#43; minutes to follow the incident. He has secondary trauma to his R temporal and occipital bones and likely a mild concussion resulting from the fall.

A 13-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0217 and expiry date not reported), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jun2021 (at the age of 13 years) as dose 2, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the first dose, bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EW0168 and expiry date not reported) on 03May2021 (at the age of 13 years) as dose 1, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Patient had no known health problems, was healthy and was on no medications. Reportedly, patient died less than 3 days later of 2nd covid shot. The initial autopsy results (done Friday) were that his heart was enlarged and there was some fluid surrounding it. The team speculated the patient said he had a cardiac event. Reporter stated that there have been cases of myocarditis in young men receiving their 2nd pfizer shot, have others died from it or was patient the first. Reporter stated that the vaccine was saving millions of lives, she knows it was mostly safe but the patient died. Reporter stated that if patient had not received the 2nd shot. we believe he would be alive today. A vaccine for a virus he had a 99.99% chance of surviving. Patient did not receive any treatment.

                                                Date of Admission: 6/19/2021 Date of Death: 6/20/2021  Primary Care Physician: No primary care provider on file.   REASON FOR ADMISSION: Patient is a 13-year-old previously healthy male who was admitted after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ROSC after CPR for 15 minutes in the field, found to be in the context of large cerebellar hemorrhage secondary to brain lesion (AVM vs tumor).   BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITALIZATION: Patient was intubated prior to arrival to the ED. Upon arrival he was started on epinephrine and norepinephrine drips to maintain perfusion and was administered bicarbonate x2. Head CTA was obtained and was notable for midbrain hemorrhage and tonsillar herniation, and no contrast enhanced blood flow in the brain.   Brain death exams were completed at 09:59 and 14:20. APNEA test was performed at 13:30, which is the official time of brain death.  Official cause of death was brainstem herniation from intracranial hemorrhage.    Mechanical ventilation was continued to allow family time to grieve and perform last rites. Time of cardiac death after mechanical ventilation withdrawal was 18:36.     HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:   FEN/Renal/Endo:  #Central DI He received 1.5 L of normal saline bolus in the ED and an additional 3 L of ringers lactate bolus overnight in the ICU to maintain perfusion and decrease heart rate.  His sodium was 141 upon presentation but reached a maximum of 160 due to central diabetes insipidus. He was started on 0.45% normal saline at 100 mL/hr to improve hypernatremia, which was monitored Q1h until normonatremic.  He additionally required vasopressin drip to be started due to central DI, which was increased to a maximum of 20 mU/kg/hr.    CV: At time of admission, epinephrine was running at 0.1 mcg/kg/min and norepinephrine was 0.1 mcg/kg/hr. Norepinephrine was increased shortly thereafter to 0.12 mcg/kg/min.   In the morning after admission, he had tachycardia to the 190s, which appeared to be narrow complex. Epinephrine and norepinephrine were discontinued. Two doses of adenosine were administered (6 mg first dose, 12 mg second dose) due to suspected SVT. The rate decreased for ~4 seconds after the second dose however returned to ~180. EKG arrived which showed sinus tachycardia so no further medications or cardiac interventions were done.  Fluid rates were increased to 2x MIVF rate and additional 500 mL bolus of LR was administered.   Norepinephrine and epinephrine were restarted and escalated due to low blood pressures in the early afternoon.to allow family time with patient.  Both titrated to effect.   Pulm: Patient was mechanically ventilated to achieve normal pH, normocarbia, and high arterial oxygen tension per brain death protocol.  He had no primary pulmonary disease during this admission.   Neuro:  #Intraparenchymal hemorrhage #Tonsillar herniation Neurosurgery was consulted. Mannitol x1 and hypertonic saline 23% x1 were administered to decrease intracranial pressures. Keppra 2g was administered for seizure prophylaxis. No sedation was needed during patient&#39;s hospitalization.

Postictal immediately following seizure activity for roughly 10-15 minutes)  on June 26th, 2021, with no history of seizures or any other comorbidities. Resulted in an ER visit on 6/26/21. MRI and EEG ordered for testing. Lab worked ordered on 7/8/21. Rescue medication ordered in the event that he has another seizure. Outcomes: EEG showing absence seizure activity however that remains undetermined at this time due to the fact that the patient never displayed any physical evidence of an absence seizure during the test as he remained alert, responsive followed directions and was able to recall information, during the part of the test that displayed absence seizure activity. MRI: No acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Referral to pediatric neurologist.

On 6/15, continued to have these symptoms then developed abdominal pain and vomited once.  Symptoms persisted on 6/16; then developed chest pain at 11:00PM and reported that pain seemed worse when inhaling and was sharp, shooting pain. Presented to ED at 12:00 AM on 6/17 and subsequently transferred to Pediatric ICU due to elevated troponin and d-dimer.  Initial EKG showed tachycardia. Cardiologist consulted. He had an echocardiogram on 6/17 AM that showed mildly depressed LV systolic function with EF ~58%. Troponin was elevated from 2.9 to 16.9. Due to echo and elevation in troponin patient received 100 gm IVIG (max dose based on  IBW). Has required one dose of 15 mg ketorolac IV and 650 mg acetaminophen PO x1 for chest pain. At 1:00 PM on 6/17, troponin increased to 54.6 and aspirin 81 mg started. Chest x-ray showed borderline cardiomegaly. On 6/18 repeat echocardiogram with normalized LVEF and considered a normal echocardiogram per cardiologist.

In the 1-2 days following the vaccine he experienced fatigue, body aches, and fever to Tmax 101F. Family treated this with anti-pyretics. On 6/18 he started having a pain in his left chest. He was again febrile at that time. On the day of admission his chest pain was worse and he was experiencing pain all over his body.   He was noted to be tachycardic in the ED. His initial labs showed a modestly elevated BNP to 593 with a markedly elevated troponin to 1233. CRP was mildly elevated at 3.8. Electrolytes were unremarkable as were LFTs. CBC w/ diff showed an absolute lymphopenia with ALC of 1000 but was otherwise unremarkable. D-Dimer was normal. He was admitted initially to hospital medicine and then was transferred to the ICU due to concern for risk of developing a cardiac arrhythmia. An echocardiogram done showed trace mitral regurgitation but was otherwise normal with normal LV function. CXR was fairly unremarkable. Coags are normal. Repeat electrolytes showed a slight bump in his creatinine. LFTs largely unchaged and procalcitonin of 0.16.    He does have a past medical history of PCR proven COVID-19 disease in December 2020.

                                                Pt is a 15 y.o. with a history of chest pain here today for evaluation. He is an ex 29 weeker with no long term consequences of prematurity.     Pt has been in his usual state of health until he developed intermittent chest pain x a few weeks. Pt had a URI for which he wasn&#39;t sure if it was allergies or a cold in April 2021.  He did receive Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine (First dose 5/16/21 and 2nd dose 6/6/21). Pt came to cardiology for echo for chest pain on 6/22/21. Echo showed pericardial effusion. Pt feel that he had chest pain before the vaccine, but Mom feels like it may have no started until after the first vaccine. Pt is quite active in basketball without issues.

                                                15 yo M with no PMH p/w 1 day of chest pain and elevated troponin and lateral ST segment elevations.  On Wednesday 6/30 he had his second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine. There after he had headache, tactile fever, fatigue and myalgias which resolved by Friday 7/2. On Friday at midnight, he awoke with 7/10 sharp substernal chest pain, non radiating. No recent trauma to the chest. He took Tylenol at home which did not relieve the pain.  No recent URI sx over the last month. The last time he remembers having URI sx was 1.5 years ago. He does endorse &#34;one or two sneezes&#34; over the past month, which he attributes to allergies.  Today 7/3, he presented to urgent care center where he got an EKG, which was concerning for ST elevations. He was given ASA which did not relieve the pain. He was sent to hospital for further work up where he had a Troponin to 1.59, CRP to 36, AST to 79, ALT to 64, Alkphos to 74, BNP to 119, ESR to 10, and WBC to 13.4.  EKG showed ST elevation in I, II, precordial leads V4 V5 V6. CXR wnl. He was given IV toradol at hospital, which alleviated his CP. He was transferred to ED for further evaluation.  On arrival to the ED on 7/3, he was HDS afebrile, with BP 111/69, HR of 80, and satting 100% on RA. His CP had resolved to a level of 0/10. Additional labs were obtained including repeat CBC (with WBC 10K, Hgb of 14), normal ESR of 20, normal D-dimer of less than 0.27, BMP wnl, elevated LFTs with AST 103, ALT of 61, elevated LDH to 293, normal GGT and alk phos, normal BNP to 28, elevated CRP to 3, and an extremely elevated troponin of 3.15. NP swab for COID, Influenza A/B, and RSV were negative. CXR wnl but did note findings consistent with degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine.  Hospital Course: Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 8 doses. His chest discomfort improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which did not show any cardiac dysfunction. His troponin downtrended while on IV steroids, therefore he was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were continuing to trend down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional NSVTs/PVCs; he was started on Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily to prevent arrhythmias after discharge. He was discharged home with a Holter monitor to be worn for 4 days. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.   By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.   Of note, CXR from 7/3 with incidental findings suspicious for degenerative disc disease at one level in the mid-distal thoracic spine. This should be followed  by his primary care physician as an out patient.   Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued medications:  - Bisoprolol 2.5mg daily (for prevention of NSVT)  - Prednisone 30mg BID (myocarditis)  - Famotidine 20mg daily (while on steroids)  Reasons for new, changed, and discontinued equipment: NA   Relevant Diagnostic Images/Studies:  Cardiac MRI (7/7): ? Normal biventricular size and systolic function. ? No regional wall motion abnormalities. ? Suggestion of increased T2 signal intensity/edema. ? Positive myocardial late gadolinium enhancement without functional correlate. ? No significant valvular dysfunction. ? No coronary artery aneurysms. ? Small pericardial effusion.  Echocardiogram (7/3): ? Normal valvular function. ? Normal left ventricular size and systolic function. ? Normal diastolic function indices. ? Reduced longitudinal strain with normal circumferential strain. ? Normal appearing proximal coronary arteries. ? Qualitatively normal right ventricular systolic function. ? No pericardial effusion present. ? A comprehensive anatomic survey was not performed at this time.
