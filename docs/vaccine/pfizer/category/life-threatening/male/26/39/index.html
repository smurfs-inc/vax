                                                Pulmonary embolisms; lung infarcts in left and right lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 28-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL5269), via an unspecified route of administration at site of left arm at 15:00 on 08Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included psoriasis and known allergies: clarithromycin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on an unspecified date. The patient experienced pulmonary embolisms and lung infarcts in left and right lungs on 11Feb2021. The patient was hospitalized for these events for 2 days. COVID was tested post vaccination (Nasal Swab covid test with negative result on 12Feb2021). No other vaccine received in four weeks. Adverse events resulted in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient received treatment (blood thinners and CT Imaging) for adverse event. No COVID prior vaccination. The outcome of events was recovered in Feb2021.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Feb2021 at 07:00 (at the age of 30-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not have any relevant medical history. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.   The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient had no symptoms until 5 days post vaccination. On 13Feb2021 at 12:15, the patient experienced fainting episode, loss of hearing, left collar-bone lymph node enlarged (noticeable swelling to area and left lower neck near carotid artery/lymph nodes), soreness in area, cold sweats, and light-headedness. The events required a visit to the physician&#39;s office and emergency room (as reported).  The clinical outcomes of the fainting episode, loss of hearing, left collar-bone lymph node enlarged, soreness in area, cold sweats, and light-headedness were unknown.    The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Syncope: After instructed to sit in the lobby for a 15 minute observation time, the patient walked 20 feet over to my consultation window after a couple minutes reporting lightheadedness/dizziness and requested a seat in my vaccination room. Upon making my way through the pharmacy to open the door the patient collapsed from a standing position to the floor. The patient regained conscience almost immediately after the fall and reported no injuries. EMS was also on scene by coincidence, shopping. The patient declined their assistance.

                                                Anaphylaxis  Please note previous VAERS report of Bell&#39;s Palsy 8 days following the first dose and subsequently treated with prednisone and valacyclovir.   This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine.

The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 18Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)).

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

                                                I am a registered  nurse at  hospital.  On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.
