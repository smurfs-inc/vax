Brought to Healthcare Facility by ambulance for treatment, and planned to transfer.  Suspected GI bleed; when flight crew arrived, decided to intubate.  Failed first attempt, and patient when into cardiac arrest.  Was revived with CPR and 2 doses of epinephrine.  Pt also received TXA and 1 unit PRBC, and fluids.  Successful second attempt, though BPs remained labile.  Pt transferred to ICU and was notified that additional evaluation found bleed had actually occurred proximal GI tract (oral mucosal bleed, not esophageal).  Pt also diagnosed prior to transfer with multilobar pneumonitis, ascites secondary to alcohol cirrhosis, hematemesis/meme positive stool, leukocytosis and pancreatitis.  Was notified by ICU less than 24 hours later that pt was on vent and stable.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

                                                After first Pfizer dose, I was just feeling really tired. After the second dose, around that afternoon/evening I started feeling my mouth feeling weird. The next day I saw blisters filled with yellow/whiteish puss in my tongue. I went to the ER later i felt a lump under left shoulder while showering. On 28 MAY 3 AM I suddenly felt my face feeling numb and tingly along with my legs. Mind you I have been in the field emplacing howizters for the past few days in a field exercise. I also jammed my finger on an 80 lb metal bar on 26 MAY and got my finger poked with a hot device that also drained the blood after getting an xray. I called medical ER  at 242 and spoke to Dr.(?) Doctor did not give me his name spelling after I asked for the spelling and he told me that I could always come in to the ER. I told him whether the finger pricking and blooding draining could cause the left facial numbness and legs tingleness. He said no so i am now assuming it is an adverse side effect. I am a smart guy have bachelors in journalism but right now I cannot concentrate and filling out htis form hastily just i case the effects get worse and I have to go to hospital er. Talking to the Dr. (?) was harder than normal and he asked if my breathing was normal, I said i am breathing heavily, which I did not have much control over. He said breathe normally and I will be better from the tingliness. I can write well I am a journalism major but this is hard to write for me . I am also feeling chills and I am also not feeling well. I was able to get this link from my local online meeting and I am glad I can contribute to the research and science in general. I wish the doctor had tested me for possible problems when I had an adverse effect from the first vaccine but the doctor told me to come back if the &#34;viral infection&#34; gets worse after I breathe normal. I did take a PT test and my 2 mile run time increased and it was much harder to run than the 2 mile run. Time went up by at least 3 minutes.

On 5/15 in the hospital he was having a hard time breathing and they were trying to give him meds to make him better, they gave him antibiotics because his blood work showed infection, and Precedex to help him rest, and he passed away the same day, he was in good health before. They also said his heart rate was 201/123 and the doctors said pulmonary anema.  It escalated so quickly.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took myself to the hospital who confirmed that hemorrhaging and blood clots had formed behind the site of my old ostomy scar inside of my intestines. I had no other signs of ulcerative colitis when scoped and no active flare, only this clotting that arose specifically after this second vaccine dose.

                                                I felt numbness in my right leg, the numbness went up to my right arm and then I started slurring. This happened within a few minutes. I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

                                                This is reported by his mother.    Around 10:00 AM he got his vaccine.  Mother met him at 12:30 and went to lunch, said he felt OK.  She stayed with him a couple of hours, went home and apparently he went to sleep.  The next day he texted his mother and said that he felt yucky.  She told him to give it a couple of days, and he went to work all week, but said that after he ate he felt &#34;funny&#34;.  Then on Sunday, Mother&#39;s day on 5/9/21 and they face timed and was supposed to meet him at 5:30.  At 12:45 he had finished eating, ate some enchilladas and said that he felt weird.  He said that he was going to be ok to meet him at 5:30.  At 4:37 PM she texted him to say that she was on her way to meet him.  She got at the meeting place at 5:30 and he was usually there before her, this is a normal weekend ritual to exchange his dog.  She waited 9 minutes and she tried to facetime him thinking he was in traffic, and he didn&#39;t answer.  She thought he was just not answering.  She then waited 9 more minutes and then called his phone and local Hospital answered the phone and asked who she was, and she answered the questions, and she told her to get to the hospital.  She went to the hospital and the doctor came in and told her that he had the car running and he went to the gas pump to get gas and he stepped out of the car and collapsed.  The person who saw him told the attended that he had collapsed and they called 9-1-1 and he was pronounced dead.  He worked in a warehouse and was doing well and about to be certified to be a forklift driving.  They said that they worked on him and that they could not get his heart started again.   They had to do an autopsy which is against her religion and she will not find out those results for 3-6 months.  She said that he was healthy and looking forward to get tested at work.  They told her that he had an enlarged heart and an enlarged spleen, and had never had any heart issues in the past.    He walked 20,000 steps a day in the warehouse.    He was living in a sober man&#39;s facility, he has been clean for 18 months.  He had an addiction to pain pills and Xanax.    She feels that there was something in the vaccine that had something to do with it as he was perfectly healthy before the vaccine.

                                                Anaphylaxis  Please note previous VAERS report of Bell&#39;s Palsy 8 days following the first dose and subsequently treated with prednisone and valacyclovir.   This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

                                                I developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Physician.   A 32-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 at single dose via an unspecified route of administration  on left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included colitis ulcerative. Concomitant medications included mesalamine. On 31Jan2021 developed atrial fibrillation which is ongoing several months later. Treatment received included  metoprolol, sotalol. At the time of the reporting the patient had not yet recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

A 33-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose  via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm on 17May2021 (late morning or early afternoon) at age of 33-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 in May2021, 15 days before the patient received the vaccine, he was doing very well, it was a light case. There were no concomitant medications. There was no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. After vaccination, the patient was feeling much better afterwards and felt fine. The patient did not think too much of it. As the day went on, it got worse. The patient had a very serious reaction. The patient had a blood clot in the lungs on 18May2021 and was in the hospital. It was very scary. It was referring to the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The patient received it in (withheld). 15 days before the patient received the vaccine, he did have COVID. The patient&#39;s doctor recommended it was ok to go back to work and to have the vaccine. The patient had the vaccine on 17May2021 and by 20May2021, he was in the hospital with blood clots in the lungs. The lung doctor was saying that the blood clot came from the vaccine. The patient had to take blood thinners for 3 months and they are concerned about the long term. The patient was in the hospital for 2 days, in (withheld) from 18May2021 to 20May2021. On 20May2021, the reporter brought the patient home. The patient was in so much pain, reporter took him back in the morning of 21May2021. For event blood clot, it had been 2 weeks. The patient went to work and came home on 18May2021 that day early from work, around 5:00 pm, having pain. The patient called the doctor who said to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) and go to bed. By that evening around 10:00 pm, they ended up taking him to the hospital, where they said he had blood clots. His pain was in the upper part and on the side by his ribs, into the back. The reporter thought at first, it was more to the left but patient was in so much pain, she really could not tell. They said the patient had 2 blood clots, one was on each lung, but they were so small. The pain was so severe. They took the patient to the hospital and he was there 2 days. On 20May2021, they released the patient. When they went to get him on 20May2021, reporter noticed that something was wrong. They gave the patient medication, a prescription pain pill. By the morning of 21May2021, around 06:00, they took him back to the hospital. They did blood work and another CT scan, and said there was no change. When they finally got the patient back into the room, they gave him some type of injection to release the pain. The reporter literally had to call another hospital, who told her to call the nurse supervisor. The reporter was outside calling the nurse supervisor for the emergency room. Then, they said that someone would come out. It had to go that far. After that, when they gave the patient the shot, the pain did subside. When it started to ware off, they gave the patient pain medication. On 22May2021, the doctor called to check on the patient. The reporter was concerned they gave the patient the shot too soon. The doctor said that it would take a while for the medication to take effect. It felt like in his back, like the muscles were too tight and the pain was so bad. The reporter had asked about a muscle relaxer and was initially told to wait until 24May2021 but then ordered a muscle relaxer and it did seem to help some what. On 22May2021, the patient started to feel like there was not any pain and his breathing felt normal. Before that (May2021), the patient&#39;s breathing was not normal. It all started happening and could not even explain when. The event blood clots in the lungs required a visit to emergency room for twice, the first time, the patient was admitted to hospital. Treatment included pain medication or muscle relaxers, apixaban (ELIQUIS) after the blood clots. The outcome of blood clots in the lungs and muscles were too tight was unknown, the outcome of rest events was resolved on 22May2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                As a clinical monitor, I was called over to assess a driver slumped over in his seat. He had just received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine approximately 10 minutes earlier. The passenger (his fiance) said he was acting normal until she heard him grunt and then realized that he was passed out.   While attempting to lay flat, I performed a jaw thrust that yielded a stridulous inspiration but was still unresponsive. He did not have a palpable carotid pulse. Paramedics was summoned emergently. Within 30-45 seconds, he awoke but was confused and amnestic to the event. He had no physical complaints and no significant medical or allergy history.   I auscultated his larynx (no stridor) and his lungs (CTA). His initial vitals: BP 90/51  HR 61  VR 16  SaO2 100% An electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or evidence of conduction delay. His glucose was 119.   Over the next 30 minutes, he was able to drink two bottles of water and some orange juice. That said, he still said he &#34;felt off.&#34; Repeat vital signs:  BP 118/62  HR 69  SaO2 100%.    The medics advised him to follow up with his doctor, preferably today. His fiance agreed to drive him to an ED near their home for a more thorough evaluation. I provided her my phone number to provide to the ED for any questions.   His clinical syndrome was consistent with a syncopal episode associated with orthostatic hypotension. Low suspicion for anaphylaxis.

A 34-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot Number: EW0164) via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm on 20Apr2021 at 14:15 (at 34 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of BNT162B2. Medical history included mast cell activation disorder from unspecified date. &#34;Known allergies: with mast cell disorders possible everything and nothing&#34; (as reported). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient got anaphylaxis about 24 hours later, which was considered serious medically significant on 21Apr2021 at 03:00 requiring emergency room visit. The patient reported he had mast cell activation disorder and got anaphylaxis about 24 hours later. The patient suspected to have more than one tryptase alpha/beta 1 (TPSAB1) gene need genetic testing to confirm thus more hemagglutinin receptors that the spike protein attached to. Outcome of the event was unknown.

This Pharmacist reported for two patients, this is the first of two reports regards to a male patient.  A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular, administered in left arm on 02Jun2021 between 10:00 and 11:00 am, maybe around 10:30ish (Batch/Lot Number: EW0178; Expiration Date: Aug2021, NDC number: 59267100002) as 1ST DOSE 0.3ML, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation at pharmacy. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. A pharmacist from pharmacy had 2 patients who received the vaccine and both had a reaction after the dose, within one hour after receiving the dose, and EMS was called. The pharmacist confirmed the first patient had the reaction within 1 hour of receiving the dose. She clarified this person was having cold sweats, about to black out, had a hard time and trouble swallowing and was turning pale, his pupils were dilated. Pharmacist explained they make them sit there for 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine so this reaction happened maybe 3 minutes after he got the shot. The EMS came and he was brought to the hospital. The patient did come back afterwards and he said the doctor didn&#39;t know 100 percent what happened, but it might been a slight allergic reaction, not to the point where he lost consciousness, but they did release him. She clarified they checked his vitals and everything and released him. When pharmacist was probed for the event, the pharmacist thought it was an anaphylactic reaction. The events require a visit to Emergency Room, patient was brought by EMS. Not had a visit to Physician Office. Unknown if patient received treatment, the pharmacist wasn&#39;t be told that much information. The outcome of events was unknown. Causality: In this case, pharmacist did not think so. She thinks maybe it was anxiety but she wouldn&#39;t know.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on plausible temporal relationship, a possible causal association between the events and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                I suffered from acute Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 18May2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0177) (at age of 34 years) as DOSE 1, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was none. Known allergies was none. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Other concomitant medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination included vitamin C gummies. The patient suffered from acute idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura on 18May2021 19:00. At the end of the 18th, patient noticed spots on arms and legs, about the size of the average mole. Later, gums bled and patient had blood blisters in mouth, from 1 to 3 after rinsing with listerine. The next day, he noticed more spots on feet and lower legs, similar to freckles. By the end of the day, his gums were bleeding unprovoked and he had hematuria. The bleeding continued and he went to the ER the following day and was informed that his platelet count dropped to 0. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Number of days of hospitalization was 3 days. Treatment received for the adverse events included Intravenous Immunoglobulin and steroids. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of events was recovering.  Information on Lot/Batch number is available; Further information has been requested.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                According to my wife, 10 minutes post shot I had what appeared to be a mild seizure and lost consciousness for 1-2 minutes. Prior to that happening, I told her I felt light headed. She notified personnel while we were in the 15 min wait holding area and when I regained consciousness two EMTs were checking me out. They took my vitals, asked me questions and had me get out of the car and walk around. I was monitored for several minutes. It was recommended I visit a hospital or urgent care if I continued to feel unwell. My wife &amp; I left the vaccine site and decided on the way home to go to the hospital just to ensure everything was all right. We went back home for about 30-60 minutes. During this time my heart rate continued to remain elevated and it felt like I had adrenaline coursing through my system. I attributed the feeling to recovering from passing out, but it did not dissipate.  Upon arrival to the ER I began having trouble trying to breathe and chest pain. During the triage EKG it was discovered I was experiencing atrial fibrillation. I was given treatment, fluids and monitored for several hours before being released. Estimated time from receiving shot to being diagnosed with afib was approximately 2.5-3 hours.

                                                My first COVID19 Pfizer vaccine shot was on 4/05/21. My second was 3 weeks later on 4/26/21.  About 30 hours after my second vaccine on 4/27/21 I started to notice tightness around my lungs/rib cage in the intercostal muscle area. For the next few days the pain increased and I had shortness of breath as well. After a few nights I couldn&#39;t lie down to sleep because of this pain so I had to sit upright to sleep.   On 5/3/21 I went to the doctor at hospital where I was examined and had a lung X-ray as well as a COVID PCR test (it was negative). The PA diagnosed me with &#34;Pneumonia&#34; and I was given antibiotics (cefuroxime and azithromycin) to take for 6-7 days.  I started feeling a little better by 5/6/21 and actually reported here on VAERS with my diagnosis of suspected Pneumonia. On 5/17/21 I had another lung x-ray at hospital and was told my lungs were looking more clear. However, for the next 2 weeks I felt more tired and my poor breathing, a cough with bloody mucus, and more chest/rib cage area pain developed. Despite being a professional runner it became hard to walk up a flight of stairs without breathing really hard and feeling light-headed.   On  5/30/21 I woke up with fairly intense chest pain just under my heart. I was taken to the ER at second Hospital and got a CT scan with contrast that showed a bilateral Pulmonary Embolism with infract. An ultra sound of my heart (normal) and blood panels were performed as well as multiple EKGs. I was given a stomach injection of Lovenox also. That afternoon I was transferred to third Hospital. for overnight monitoring with more EKGs and Lovenox injections. Prescribed blood thinner Pradaxa for 3 months with no known cause of clots that caused this Pulmonary Embolism. Kidney test and Heart appeared normal. Still waiting on genetic testing. Lung infract has caused lasting chest pain and my breathing has yet to return back to normal.

A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26Apr2021 11:15 (Lot Number: ER8729, at age of 35 years old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mild asthma, mild allergy to latex. Concomitant medications included albuterol [salbutamol] taken for asthma; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12); vitamin d. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunisation (Brand=Pfizer ER8736; time: 11:15 AM; location: Left arm; Facility type: Hospital). The patient experienced intense chest/ribcage and Lower back pain and tightness around lungs about 30 hours after 2nd dose of COVID19 vaccine in Apr2021. Trouble breathing too. Initially diagnosed with Pneumonia a week later on 03May2021 by chest X-ray. Symptoms did not resolve after antibiotics and fatigue and breathing troubles got worse in May2021. Coughing also became a symptom in May2021. Also, lung pain intensified several weeks later along with chest pain. On 30May2021 was rushed to ER and diagnosed with bilateral Pulmonary Embolism via CT contrast scan. It appeared patient never had Pneumonia, but instead blot clots forming in his lungs on unknown date. It was also reported adverse event start date: 06Apr2021; Adverse event start time: 04:45 PM. Adverse events resulted: in [Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Hospitalization, Life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event), Disability or permanent damage] Hospitalization: 1 day. The patient underwent additional lab tests and procedures: COVID test post vaccination: Nasal Swab PCR on 03May2021 result: Negative; Blood test IGG IGM on 01Jun2021 result: Positive. The patient received treatment as Lovenox injections and blood thinner prescription. The outcome of events was recovering.

                                                I had the 1st shot on Wednesday March 10th. On Sunday the 14th, just before going to bed at about 11pm, I went to pee. The urine was very dark brown. Didn&#39;t appear to have any red for blood. The next day I felt like water was being retained and it felt that I couldn&#39;t empty the bladder and pee was coming out slower than usual. Late Monday the 15th before bed I peed another dark brown urine and a red blood clot came out. At that point I became very concerned and sent to see the doctor on the 16th. Referred to a kidney specialist for March 31st. Between March 14th to March 29th , somedays I felt like I was retaining water, most days felt like I couldn&#39;t empty my bladder with slow flow. With the recent news of the concerns of blood clots with vaccines, I felt that I should report this.

A 36-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number; Unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as SINGLE DOSE, dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 21Mar2021 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot Number; Unknown) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced he had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of pfizer biontech). (illness) on 18Mar2021, admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) (hospitalization) on 08Apr2021. The patient was hospitalized for admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) on 08Apr2021 in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 18Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)). I wanted to report since the 2nd dose Pfizer BioNTech was taken on 21Mar2021 &amp; then in hospital ICU with a stroke (at 36 yrs old) on 08Apr2021. Hospitalized for 4 days in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered, admitted with stroke on 08Apr2021. The outcome of the event for illness was unknown and for stroke was not recovered.  Information about Lot/batch number is requested.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Received injection at approx. 10:30am. Waited at vaccination site for approx. 30 minutes with no reaction. At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time. In the military...very healthy.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm, at the age of 37 years, on Apr2021 at a SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included brain tumor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. On 09Apr2021, the patient stated, &#34;I am undergoing immunotherapy treatment for a brain tumor. My doctors recommended I take the vaccine 2 weeks following my most recent treatment (administered every 4 weeks). Several hours after receiving the vaccine, the right side of my body was very weak and my balance was off. These symptoms went away by the next morning. 5 days later they came back and progressed. Ultimately, I went to the emergency room having trouble walking, using my right arm and staying balanced. All tests (MRIs, ultrasound, CT scan, extensive bloodwork, and more) proved that there were no apparent causes. Ultimately, it was concluded that I had a stroke and the vaccine was likely the main contributor. I am 37, in shape, and eat extremely well.&#34;  The patient was hospitalized for the events. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: there were no apparent causes, computerised tomogram: there were no apparent causes, magnetic resonance imaging: there were no apparent causes, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 15Apr2021 and ultrasound scan: there were no apparent causes on an unspecified date. Therapeutic measures (Aspirin prescription, Castor, physical therapy) were taken as a result of the events. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, May 18, 2021 at 1:53pm EDT. Many of the &#34;typical&#34; or &#34;expected&#34; side effects commenced about 12 hours later, including chills, night sweats, a slight fever (99.5), and headache and lethargy the following day.   Nothing was particularly off-putting until the afternoon of Wednesday, May 19, 2021, when I noticed small red spots on my legs and feet. A Google search suggested petechiae and enough cause for me to go to a nearby urgent care clinic. The petechiae were present on both legs and feet (and eventually a few spots on my hands), though a little more pronounced on the left side (with one noteworthy cluster on my left leg). I had no apparent gum bleeding or bruising (maybe one bruise, but the urgent care doctor thought it was there beforehand).  The doctor at the urgent care clinic confirmed petechiae and ran stat blood work for return that night. At ~9pm EDT on Wednesday, May 19, 2021, I received a phone call from the urgent care&#39;s centralized lab informing me that my platelet count was 2 (10^3/uL) -- dangerously low, with risk of spontaneous bleeding and in the worst case scenario brain hemorrhage -- and my PTT was 55.6 seconds. They told me to report to an emergency room immediately, the nearest of Medical Center.  The diagnosis was eventually Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP). Every physician I&#39;ve encountered has felt that the occurrence one-day post-vaccination points to the vaccine as the cause. (For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think any of the doctors or nurses I encountered had never seen a platelet count so low. Most of them said as much.) My discharge papers officially note as the diagnoses: petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and adverse effect of vaccine.  I have included details related to my platelet count, treatment course, and other figures below (and am happy to provide corroborating information where appropriate). The doctors did not run any d-dimers, PF4 HIT ELISA, or fibrinogen tests, and no imaging was performed, presumably because I did not present with any signs of simultaneous clotting (e.g., TTP or VITT). They&#39;ve also told me that my haptoglobin and hemoglobin levels were normal (see below), which I am told helps support the notion that there was / is no clotting or &#34;red blood cell breakdown.&#34;  Search terms: decreased platelet count, immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, severely low platelet count, low platelets, petechiae, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia, vaccine-induced ITP

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

                                                He presented to hospital ED with new onset chest pain.  He reports that he woke up this morning nauseous and he vomited after which he has started developing retrosternal chest pressure and some shortness of breath for which he came to the emergency room for assessment. In the emergency room he was given both a GI cocktail and nitropaste with wheeze the symptoms improved.  He was transferred to a medical center for higher level of care. At present he is essentially symptoms free.  The EKG showed right bundle branch block and all septal myocardial infarction.  The right bundle branch block is new compared to his last EKG.  The initial troponin was mildly increased at 0.18 and BNP was 118. The renal function is normal with a creatinine of 0.8 and the chest x-ray shows bilateral interstitial opacities which might represent pulmonary edema. He remains admitted

                                                10:00PM Saturday, 4/17/21 Sudden chest pain. Tried to sleep it off, pain lingered all day Sunday 4/18/21. 8:00PM went to local ER with same chest pain, had not gotten better. ER took blood draw, my troponin was 4.6 and doctors thought it was an error since I am 38 years old and otherwise health with no history of chest pain or family history of heat trouble. Second blood draw showed troponin at 5.0 getting worse. They called an ambulance and took me to the hospital nearby. Third blood draw showed 6.0 and I spiked at 10.0 overnight. I had several EKGs, a CT scan, and an angiogram. None of these showed any obstructions or blockages in the heart or blood vessels that could have caused the heart trauma. I had an echocardiogram which showed that my heart is only pumping at 50% which is low for a healthy young person who is a runner. I was diagnosed with myocarditis and with having had a Non-ST Segment Elevation Heart Attack. Again, I have no family history of this, I am otherwise healthy, I do not use drugs and I did not have any trauma to my chest, such as a car accident, that could have caused this. The only explanation is that it was related to the COVID shot, which I had roughly 48 hours before my sudden chest pain

Pt did well with immediate CPR and cardioversion on the scene but he had no hx of major heart disease.  Minor LV dysfunction ( LV 45%).  It turned out on that the next day 6/1 pt developed fever and then COVID was checked and  was positive.  He then developed true covid and was treated.  Echo revealed a new dilated CM with reduced EF.   I feel his arrest was more likely related to the active covid or his DCM but wanted to report in case given the temporal association

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EW0153), via an unspecified route of administration in arm right on 16Apr2021 12:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. Concomitant medications included vitamin b12 nos (VITAMIN B12) and colecalciferol (D3). On 18Apr2021, the patient went urgent care for breathing difficulty; On 19Apr2021, patient went ER for off balance, dizzy, and breathing difficulty and was prescribed with ibuprofin, meclazine and rest for 8 days; On 07May2021, lower right backpain started (not taken 2nd dose scheduled), on 08May2021, pain moved to right chest; On 09May2021, patient went urgent care-identified PE and admitted to hospital; On 11May2021 discharged; Under blood thinner medication (heprion). Adverse events start date of off balance, dizzy, and breathing difficulty was 18Apr2021 04:00. AEs resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, hospitalization, life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Patient was hospitalized for 3 days. Covid test post vaccination: Nasal Swab on 09May2021: Negative; Nasal Swab on 09May2021: Negative; Nasal Swab on 19Apr2021: Negative. Outcome of the events was resolving.

                                                Per hospital intake, the patient had ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest in the field just a few hours after receiving his second Pfizer COVID 19 vaccination. EMS was called, and 20 minutes of CPR were administered, prior to achieving ROSC. Patient was sedated and intubated and taken into Hospital. Cooling protocol was initiated and CT angio did not show any evidence of pulmonary embolism. Patient also underwent cardiac catheterization, which was was negative for clear intracardiac or coronary abnormalities or stenoses. Ultimately, the patient was transferred to medical center for implantation of AICD device. No other obvious source or etiology of arrest, but did think worth reporting given temporal proximity to vaccination.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 38-year-old male with no significant past medical history other than a BMI of 37 and a past history of COVID-19 infection in February 2021 which was asymptomatic with  no sequela after he was required to test after his wife tested positive .he is on no medications prior to arrival, he smokes an occasional cigar and drinks alcohol only occasionally who presented to the emergency room on 6/6/21 With a chief complaint of difficulty breathing,  fever, malaise and significant left-sided chest pain that have been ongoing since May 23 slowly worsening.  He denied any recent travel any recent illness any recent sick contacts.  He denied any illicit drug use over-the-counter supplement use .patient reported he received his first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 5/17/2021 and a few days after began to feel congestion with mild coughing which progressed.  He initially thought he may be having  allergies and took some Claritin without relief.  As the week went on he developed increasing shortness of breath and cough and also developed a fever.  He went to the well now urgent care on June 3 and was told he may have pulled a muscle and was sent home.  He returned back to our emergency room in the early morning of 6/4 complaining of again of left-sided chest pain radiating into his ribs with associated shortness of breath worse with inspiration associated with coughing but no hemoptysis.  At that time he had no complaints of fever or chills.  He works at a hardware store and thought perhaps he may have strained himself lifting heavy boxes of flooring.  During that ER visit he was hypotensive and tachycardic with respirations of 30.  CTA of the chest did not show any pulmonary emboli but showed inflammatory changes in the left side in the lingula consistent with possible acute community-acquired pneumonia.  He was given Toradol and morphine and was discharged home on oral antibiotics.  His EKG at that time showed sinus tachycardia the ST segments were normal.  He was afebrile.  He returned back to the emergency room the morning of 6/5 with complaints of worsening left-sided chest pain worsening shortness of breath and worsening fatigue.  He reported any movement he develops a cough and he cannot lie flat as he develops significant chest pain which is relieved with sitting up.  He had been taking some ibuprofen with minimal improvement.  He also reported some nausea and fatigue.  He had a fever at home of 102 °F just before coming to the hospital but arrived afebrile.  Patient admitted to having COVID-19 infection in February when his wife tested positive.  He was asymptomatic other than a headache for 1 day and recovered without any incident.  In the ER he was again tachycardic but was afebrile.  His blood pressure was 137/81 his O2 sat was 97% on room air.  He however was quite tachypneic with respirations of 35 at times at rest.  Lab work revealed a white blood cell count of 13.2 with significant elevations of his erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP at 75 and 20.8 respectively.  Covid testing was negative.  Repeat chest imaging reveals a large left pleural effusion and atelectasis with no pulmonary edema.  CT scan of the chest revealed no pulmonary emboli but now reveals right middle lobe and bibasilar infiltrates suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process.    EKG revealed sinus tachycardia but no ST changes were apparent.  Was clinically dehydrated with an elevated specific gravity positive nitrites but 0-9 white blood cells on urinalysis.  Troponin at 0-hour was low -3 1 hour was -3 with no change in his delta.  BNP was normal at 14 lactic acid was normal at 1.1.  Procalcitonin was normal at 0.60 and lipase was normal at 21 with a normal CMP.  He was subsequently admitted to the hospitalist service.  In the emergency room he was given Rocephin and azithromycin. The following day his condition worsened with continued fever and increasing shortness of breath. . ESR was worsened from 75 to 82 and cardiac crp now &gt;200. A stat echo was ordered and his case was reviewed with the cardiologist. there was concern for possible myo/pericarditis so pt was started on colchicine and ibuprofen tid and the decision was made to transfer the patient to a larger tertiary care facility. stat echo showed normal ef and no sign pericardial effusion. He was transferred to another hospital where he was followed by cardiology and pulmonology. He ultimately underwent thorocentesis but the fluid reaccumulated so a chest tube/drain was placed. He was treated for a peripneumonic effusion. cultures and cytology were ultimately negative. acid fast bacilli was negative, blood cultures were negative. covid 19 pcr testing was negative x 2. He was discharged home on 6/11/2021 with instructions to continue augmentin bid for 4 more weeks with close follow up with pulmonary and repeat chest x ray in 1 month,

                                                The heart rate was 245; A blood clot in the caller&#39;s neck; It was thought he might have lymphoma; Felt like he had a golf ball in his left arm/that little golf ball in his arm started traveling to his whole body- his back, his chest, legs, calves; Sweating; Didn&#39;t feel too great; Breathing was off/trouble breathing; Throat was hurting/sore throat; Neck was swollen; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer (patient) reported for himself that:  A 38-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8131 or ER8231 and Expiration date were not reported) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 18Apr2021 (at the age of 38-year-old) as first dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 18Apr2021, he went to get the Covid shot through name withheld which Pfizer sponsors and it was done at name withheld. He went there and took the shot. He was told to wait 15 minutes and then left. When he got to car, immediately he felt like he had a golf ball in his left arm. The next couple of days, that little golf ball in his arm started traveling to his whole body. He felt it in his back, his chest, he felt it in his legs. Literally, in the next 3 days, he felt it literally travel through his whole body. He felt it in his calves, it was crazy also mentioned they felt sore or like ball in the arm. He started sweating and didn&#39;t feel too great. He thought it was standard side effects and didn&#39;t think much of it. A couple of days past by and then Thursday morning, he woke up and his breathing was very off. He clarifies his throat was hurting. He thought it was a sore throat and took some cough medicine and cough drops. Then the next day, it wasn&#39;t going away and was still hurting, wasn&#39;t getting any better. His breathing was very rough. If he was just standing still like laying down, then felt okay. But if went to move or do something it was very difficult. Again, expecting these symptoms, some people have said these symptoms and he didn&#39;t&#39; think much of it. The next morning patient woke up and breathing felt fine. His neck was swollen. He thought maybe he had a sore throat or something. He was taking cough drops to soothe his throat the following day, the throat was still hurting, and it was the same. The patient called the doctor and did a telehealth. The patient told the doctor when he received the first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine and all his symptoms. The doctor said it is a little unpredictable, nothing the doctor hasn&#39;t heard. He went to the doctor office the next day and was hooking to a nebulizer for breathing and prescribed an asthma pump. The doctor thought patient had Lymphoma in the neck. The doctor wanted to go the following day for an ultrasound. He went to the ultrasound and they checked the neck and immediately there were red flags. His heart rate was checked, and the heart rate was 245. The patient was hospitalized from 27Apr2021 to 08May2021. The minute they saw heart rate and started putting intravenous and received treatment to low down heart rate. The heart rate went down to 170 or 165. He had x-rays and a CAT scan done. He had fluids in his heart and fluid in the lung and a blood clot in neck. He had a hole cut open on left side to lungs and the lungs were drained. He went back to the ICU, they ran another CAT scan and X-ray and gave the medication. He does not know if this medication was antibiotics or what the medication was. The CDC received this information because the patient case was so rare. When the CAT scan and X-rays were run again, the fluid is right back up in the lungs. Then he was taken to surgery for the heart. An incision was cut from where itches is to back on the side, a very big incision. The heart was gone into to cut a little piece around the heart. Something was cut out so the heart could drain, and fluid could get out of the heart. While all of this is happening, he wasn&#39;t getting any better, was getting worse. The patient health deteriorated, breathing was about 10 percent and was hooked up to a breathing machine. He was sedated at that time and not awake anymore. The machine was keeping him alive. Now, every day for basically five days he was asleep and not knowing what was going on and was tested for Leukemia, cancer, and A to Z every disease you can think of to try to find common ground. Everything came back negative; nothing was wrong with the caller. He was given this or that medication every day and was sedated for about 5 days. Every day of the sedation was getting worse. He was dying and time was ticking. On the 5th day, everything was getting worse. The woman kicked everyone out of the room and went into his mouthpiece on the ventilator that was keeping the alive doing the breathing for the patient. The woman pulled something out of his lung. The woman started pumping him with steroids. What the woman took out of his lung stopped the fluid from going in. The fluid wouldn&#39;t fill back up in the lung. Once the woman started giving the steroids, the steroids killed the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. The steroids reversed the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. He was started breathing on his own again. After a couple of hours, the patient finally woke up. The patient is now recovered and has been home the past few weeks on a whole bunch of medication. He is on blood thinners, steroids, and stomach stuff. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Left leg DVT.    I am a nephrologist practicing in my area.  10 days or so  after receiving Pfizer vaccine I started noticing left leg swelling and some redness. I didn&#39;t pay attention to it because I thought this could be a muscle or tendon issues because of my exercise. But the swelling did not go away, however, it decreased overtime with leg elevation, etc but when I checked my leg I found out that I have a DVT.   I am a healthy 39 ( when I received the vaccine but I am 40  now). I don&#39;t smoke. No family history.  I am on a blood thinner now.   I need to report this as I think that it is important to be reported.   I read in the news that a 40 year-old man was diagnosed with DVT after Pfizer vaccine  Please call or email if you need further info

                                                Passed away from a Pulmonary Embolism; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 39-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 39 years old, on 11Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included wolff-parkinson-white syndrome from an unknown date to 15Mar2021. The patient was diagnosed with this later in life, but was told he probably had it his entire life it just hadn&#39;t caused any issues for him. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously got the flu vaccine for immunization every year with no issues. The patient passed away from a pulmonary embolism on 15Mar2021. The patient was not hospitalized prior to his death.  He died from the pulmonary embolism in his sleep. The reporter denied any medications, labs, testing, or treatments for her husband relevant to these events. The patient died on 15Mar2021. There was a private autopsy performed and they said that the Pfizer Covid Vaccine was one of the contributing factors to the patient&#39;s death. The autopsy said the vaccine was a contributing factor. The reporter stated she told them since they said it was the pulmonary embolism that killed him, then that&#39;s what it should say. The Medical Examiner was saying that the science for the vaccine is so new, they just don&#39;t have the data that they need.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Pulmonary embolism

He did not seek medical treatment and it resolved. He called it an anaphylactic reaction. I did not administer the second dose of Pfizer vaccine as a precaution. I told him to seek advice from his doctor and if he chooses to get the second dose, he should get it at a medical facility or doctor&#39;s office.

                                                Adverse Event: Pericardial effusion (15 mm). Signs/symptoms were growing chest pain and shortness of breath for 8 days until a CT angiogram revealed the condition.  Cardiologist was not able to identify the condition despite, EKG, echocardiogram, and nuclear stress test. ER administered IV steriod, and new cardiologist prescribed Indomethacin and Cochicine.  The condition lasted approximately 3 weeks the first time.  I am now experiencing a recurrence of the pericarditis/effusion which has been going on for 2 weeks.
