On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

                                                syncope; fell from standing; hit head on table; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable health professional. A 27-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EW0164), intramuscular in the left arm on 15Apr2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccinations within 4 weeks of the vaccine. On 15Apr2021, immediately after the vaccine, the patient experienced syncope due to which he fell. He fell from standing and hit his head on a table. There were no signs of soft tissue injury. The patient was brought into the emergency department from the vaccination room. The patient was not treated for the events. The clinical outcome of syncope, fell from standing and hit head on table was resolved on Apr2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of  BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot  be excluded based on temporal association.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient reported chest pain for 2 days and intermittent jaw pain after receiving his second Pfizer COVID vaccine on 4/22, and presented to the ER on 4/25 with a headache and emesis. An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 28Dec2020, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). A 29-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1685), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 21Dec2020 at 05:30 at 0.3 mL single (first dose) for Covid. Medical history was reported as &#34;none&#34;. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received Flu vaccine in Oct2020 for immunization. The patient is an Occupational Therapist, and he called to report an adverse event that he experienced with the first dose of the COVID Vaccine. He received the vaccine last Monday, 21Dec2020 at 5:30AM before his shift at work, then 20 minutes later, he was having severe stroke like symptoms. He experienced severe left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in his left hand and foot, he had issues finding his words and he couldn&#39;t speak, and he had an oral motor impairment where his mouth was weak and not coordinated. The staff at the hospital did a neurological exam on him, and he failed, so he had to go to the emergency room (ER). The patient added that he was already in the hospital when this happened, and the ER doctors suspected that he had a CVA, and they gave him TPA to prevent any permanent brain damage and it worked. The patient then added that due to the shock of this whole event, from  everything that happened, it has weakened his heart. Reportedly, he is a healthy 29 year old man, with no preexisting conditions, and he works out, and he has no heart conditions, but he had to get a cardiology follow up a few days after he got the vaccine, because he started going in to Ventricular Tachycardia, which he had never had in his life. So, the doctors at the hospital went ahead and did an Echocardiogram and an EKG, and he was told that his Ejection Fraction is down to 25%. He stated his heart is so weak, that he cannot work right now, but the structure of his heart is fine and has not had any damage. The hospital staff thought that maybe the patient had a chronic heart issue that he just did not know about, and that the stress of this event maybe made it kick into overdrive, but he states that the cardiologist said that was not the case, because the structure of his heart is fine, and the only thing they can see is that the heart is pumping weak. One physician even suggested that due to the shock of the event, he might have Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, which is a broken heart, but because the structure of his heart is okay, it should be reversible. He stated that he is hoping he will heal up good, because he is young and has no pre-existing conditions. He added that his heart is in such a state right now; he has to wear an external defibrillator. The patient stated that all these happened about 20 minutes after he received the vaccine, and he was admitted to the hospital from 21Dec2020 to 25Dec2020. His neurological symptoms have resolved except that he has a stutter that he did not have before and his mouth is fatigued easily, so he has to slow down when he is eating, but now he can eat regular for the most part. The patient confirmed that he was not specifically prescribed the product; it was administered to him at his place of work, but it was optional. He stated he considered how he is working with COVID patients every day, and given the circumstance, he thought that it would be a best practice for him to get the vaccine. He had not gone to his primary care doctor in a while because he had been fine and healthy, but he called them and found out that his primary care had retired, so he has to find a new one now. Regarding the issues finding words and trouble speaking, he stated that he has improved, but it is still ongoing, he is just stuck in a plateau zone. With the Ventricular Tachycardia, he stated that this is an ongoing issue, as he has to wear the life vest even though he has no need to activate it yet. He did have one minor bought of the VTach, but because he is a therapist, he knows how to take care of it with relaxation techniques, he knows how to manage it. He had one bought of VTach the evening prior, but he was able to get it under control. The doctors have him on medication to help keep his heart rate at bay. He has never had to use medication before and is on the following medications to help keep his heart rate at bay: Metoprolol 25mg one tablet once daily by mouth and Lisinopril 5mg one tablet once daily by mouth. The VTach has improved, it was good enough he was able to discharge home, but it is still a concern. His cardiologist said that, basically his hope, is that once his body recover from the whole shock of everything, then his ejection fraction will heal, and his heart will heal. He again stated that the doctor told him that the structure of his heart is perfectly fine; he has thick walls in his heart, no leaking valves, and the heart was not conducting any abnormal signals. The doctor just said that right now, his heart is super weak and that it is an acute problem. With the Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, he states that two doctors mentioned this diagnosis, but he confirmed that he was not actually diagnosed with this issue, he was just diagnosed with Ventricular Tachycardia. The outcome of the ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown to the patient at this time as he has not had another EKG or echocardiogram, but the cardiologist told him that the cardiologist expects that this will not be resolved quickly anyway. The patient confirmed that he did not receive any other vaccines on the same day he received the COVID vaccine. The only other vaccine he had this year was the flu vaccine which he got back in Oct2020. He has gone on to his online portal and there are the bloodwork results and all the imaging results on there from his CTs and MRIs, but he did not see the EKG or Echocardiogram results yet. He does not have this pulled up at this time, but he does have access to this stuff and can provide it later, if requested. He is curious about the next steps from here to how his case is processed. He is also curious if this information would help Pfizer make modifications to the vaccine if it is found that a lot of people are having the same reaction as he did. He is also wondering, given his situation, that probably he is not going to get the second dose, for his safety, but he is wondering what percentage of effectiveness the first dose does having just covered. The events left sided weakness, loss of balance, extreme numbness and tingling in left hand and foot resolved on 25Dec2020; severe stroke like symptoms and oral motor impairment; mouth weakness and not coordinated/mouth is fatigued easily resolved in 2020. The events ventricular tachycardia/help keep his heart rate at bay and issues finding words and trouble speaking were resolving, stutter had not resolved while the outcome of the events it has weakened his heart, and ejection fraction down to 25% was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is unclear and does not allowa meaningful assessment of the case. It will be reassessed upon receipt of follow up information. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EK4176) in the hospital, via intramuscular route on 10Feb2021 at 10:30 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma from 2010 to 2011 and allergies to penicillin on an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination, was the patient not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: H9899) in the hospital, via intramuscular route at 01:15 PM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Since the vaccination the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that on 12Feb2021 at 08:00 PM (also reported as &#39;3 days after injection&#39;) the patient experienced flu-like symptoms that included fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, and a persistent headache. On 13Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 4th day&#39;, the patient developed pleurisy and difficulty breathing and had 2 syncope events the morning of 14Feb2021 (also reported as &#39;on the 5th day&#39;). The patient was taken by ambulance and admitted to ER for further testing. It was determined that all symptoms likely related to the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine recently received. Pleurisy persists one week following vaccine dose. The patient went to the emergency room/department or urgent care due to the events. As treatment for the event, the patient was monitored and given IV fluids over 12 hour stay in CDU. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae (reported as recovered with lasting effects). The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                I felt soreness and pressure build up in my arm starting a few hours after the receiving the dose. The soreness and pressure got progressively worse over the course of two days. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, just uncomfortable. The second day after the vaccine I had stretched my arm pretty good for minute, when I released the stretch I felt a rush of something for from my arm into my torso. I got really dizzy and passed out, my wife was in the room at the time and said I never closed my eyes; but I had completely blacked out. My wife had woken me up and I wasn&#39;t sure what had happened, it took me about 30 seconds to realize I had passed out after stretching that arm. My arm had felt better after waking up from passing out, and soreness had passed a couple days later. I didn&#39;t get checked out,  after I woke up I started feeling fine.  I&#39;m honestly not sure if it&#39;s directly related to the vaccine or not, I just thought I should let someone know just in case.

                                                Patient received his 1 dose of Pfizer vaccine and was waiting in our lobby for the recommended 15 minutes. He fainted after about 10 minutes. He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

I was sitting on the couch with my family and my sister said I had only fallen asleep for about 20 minutes. I take seizure prevention medication each night prior to bed. I had not taken the medication yet but I was up to date on taking this medication. I had not had a seizure in 6 years since starting my medication. I did not have a fever before or after this seizure. I was generally feeling normal prior to the seizure ,after receiving the vaccine.

A 30-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 23Mar2021 13:00 as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cervical spondylosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no history of COVID prior vaccination. The patient was not COVID tested post vaccination. There were no concomitant medications. On 05Apr2021, the patient experienced Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), arrhythmia resulting in syncope event, and heart palpitations following. The event resulted in a doctor or healthcare professional office/clinic visit, emergency room/department or urgent care, and has caused hospitalization for one day. It was unknown if a treatment was received for the events. The patient was recovering from the events.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                After receiving the vaccine, I was instructed to wait i for 15 minutes to ensure there were no reactions. I sat down in the provided chair, put my headphones in my ears, and started my timer on my watch for 15 minutes. after about 5 minutes I began to feel like my injection arm was a little weak, as if perhaps my arm was stiffening from the injection sore. I remember feeling slightly warm and started to read over the COVID-19 Vaccine symptoms sheet and then I blacked out (Fainted). The nurse in the hallway woke me up and was asking me if i was alright and then rushed me in the back room where they tested me and ensured I was ok. I had not eaten anything the morning of the vaccination shot and barely anything the night before. I have been experiencing higher levels of anxiety recently due to pressures of day to day life; school, work, etc. The nurses are thinking it is likely I had more of a reaction to the anxiety and low food or blood sugar (I am not diabetic), than a reaction to the vaccine itself. They did refer to my experience as sounding like Vasovagal syncope. I have never had this experience with any flu vaccine or shots before; I do not have a fear of needles or shots.

                                                I felt fine the rest of yesterday but started to feel really tired and worn down late last night. I took my sleeping pill like normal and went to bed. I woke up feeling really achy and cold so I went to take some Tylenol in case I had a fever. Started feeling dizzy and light headed and I passed out. I cut my foot on the glass I dropped and scraped my back as I fell. I don?t remember being blacked out very long. I just remember sitting on the floor feeling really lethargic. My whole body felt tingly and my ears were ringing really bad. Was able to get up and get back to bed. Decided to go back to sleep and not go to the ER. This morning I?m still a little dizzy but mostly just have a headache and am extremely tired. I plan to get into my doctor today so I will keep you updated. Just wanted to let you know what happened so you could report it.

                                                Patient has a fear of needles, which was not mentioned initially. The patient got the vaccine and was told to have a seat outside the immunization room for 15 minutes at least to ensure no side effects. The patient wanted to get something in the store. Pharmacist was immunizing the next patient already. Patient knocked on the door and stated he didn&#39;t feel good and was dizzy. I told him  to take a seat I was going to get him some water. As he was about to sit down he passed out and hit the door with his head. EMS was called and patient was taken to hospital. The patient woke up 30 seconds after and was dizzy. He felt better after about 5 minutes.

Approximately five minutes later he mentioned to his female colleague who was with him that he felt feverish and sweaty and when he reached over to get a drink from his water bottle he fell over and passed out for a few seconds.  By the time I ran out to check on him he was already getting up and I had him sit in the chair while my technician called 9-1-1.  The paramedics soon came out (I think it was about 10 minutes) and checked him out.  Both theirs and my IR thermometers showed a normal temperature.  His BP was normal according to the paramedics.  They asked some more questions and ultimately let him go home under his own power with his female cohort.

                                                Syncope: After instructed to sit in the lobby for a 15 minute observation time, the patient walked 20 feet over to my consultation window after a couple minutes reporting lightheadedness/dizziness and requested a seat in my vaccination room. Upon making my way through the pharmacy to open the door the patient collapsed from a standing position to the floor. The patient regained conscience almost immediately after the fall and reported no injuries. EMS was also on scene by coincidence, shopping. The patient declined their assistance.

I laid down and called a  nurse adviser. I was recommended to go to ER, so my wife took me to ER. They did CT scan of my head, then CT scan of my head and neck with contrast, then MRI of my head, then MRI of my head and neck with contrast. It was confirmed that I had an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE. It was decided to perform carotid endarterectomy surgery to remove a clot in the neck carotid artery. The clot was removed.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 19Apr2021, this case now contains serious adverse reaction. Information processed together.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) via Medical Information team. A 31-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number and Expiration date were not reported) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was in excellent health and had no known allergies. The patient had took the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 18 days prior reporting (on 01Apr2021) and had blood pressure dropped to 70/50 and emergency medical services (EMS) was called an hour with him. The reporter was asking if the patient should take the second dose being that he had this reaction. The reporter further asked for the efficacy of one dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and how long was the coverage of the vaccine as far as needing a booster shot. The reporter also asked about the 6 months topline analysis results of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. It was further reported that fifteen minutes after the COVID-19 shot on 01Apr2021, the patient passed out; the patient had a big blood pressure drop from 110/90 to 70/50. The EMS was called in and attended to the patient. The patient was there for about an hour. The reporter was just calling to find out if the patient could get the second shot. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

Called virtual appointment tele doctor who prescribed Katorolac which I took from Wednesday night to Thursday morning per prescription with no effects. On Thursday evening called tele doctor again and got Ibuprophene 800 mg prescription. It helped for 20-30 min only. Same evening coughed some blood. On Friday kept taking Ibuprophene for very temporary relieve. On Saturday April 10 was admitted to hospital and was hospitalized with blood cloth diagnosis for 4 days.

                                                Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; Slurring his speech; Stroke; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 35-year-old male patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in deltoid (unknown if right or left) on 17Dec2020 at 30 ug, single for &#39;Preventative&#39;. Medical history included hypertension. There were no concomitant medications.(Physician) He is calling about the Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine. States what is going on with the patient may be associated as a side effect. The patient got the vaccine two to three weeks ago, he clarifies the patient received the vaccine on 17Dec2020 and the patient ended up acutely developing (states it is a presumptive diagnosis) Acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis, states it looks like a radiologic diagnosis. The patient is an employee at hospital. When querying seriousness states it is medically significant but could be disabling but he thinks the patient will recover. Reporter seriousness for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis: Medically significant, Hospitalization. Patient was hospitalized on Sunday and he is still admitted at this time. Dates when patient was in hospital for acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from 03Jan2021 to ongoing. Caller thinks the patient was flown to (Place) yesterday. The patient&#39;s mother asked the caller if the caller thought the acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis was from the vaccine and the caller responded that he did not think it was from the vaccine. He confirms the patient is still admitted in the hospital and the patient&#39;s attending neurologist is doctor. The caller heard about the patient from doctor. When querying covid vaccine dose, the caller states the standard dose is 30 mcg. This was clarified and documented as provided. The patient has not received his second dose yet. He asks if the patient should receive the second dose. He asks a general question if a pregnant patient can be given the Pfizer covid vaccine. He heard the patient had a stroke then the CFO tried to talk to him and the patient was slurring his speech. Caller spoke to the patient&#39;s mother this morning and caller told the mother that he would try to find out what is going on with the patient.  He asked that the patient get an HIV test even though he does not think the patient is at risk. Vaccination facility type was Hospital. Vaccine administered at military facility was No. None additional vaccines administered on same date of the PFIZER suspect. AE acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis require a visit to Emergency Room, not visit to physician office. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. He has heard of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis being associated with vaccines in the past and states that it is rare and usually in kids. States he saw patients that may have had acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis back in the 80s and 90s. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (Patient will get steroids tonight pending the review of the x-ray). The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported stroke with speech slurred, and the presumptive diagnosis of acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (looks like a radiologic diagnosis by the reporting physician), was most likely an intercurrent disease, and unlikely causally related to the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 35- year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Lot number: EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration, on 12Apr2021 at 09:30 am (at the age of 35-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination, in left arm. The facility where COVID-19 vaccine was administered was a hospital. No known allergies. Patient has no relevant medical history. States: I live a healthy lifestyle diet, exercise, proper rest. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 12Apr2021 10:00 am, the patient stated: I passed out and or blacked out on my drive home from the hospital. I was careful to follow the 15minute wait period before I left the hospital and was ok at that point. I had tense nerve feelings came over me as it grew so strong, I was forced to try and get my car on an off ramp to leave the highway I was on. I thankfully did not get any real injuries to my body as I spun and landed on the side of the road in the grass area. However, this experience was horrifying to say the least. I had a delayed reaction to this vaccine, other than this one incident, I really only had the typical body aches or pain for 24 hours and a bit of nerve twitching. I will not mark this as a risk of death, because it was my driving a car that risked my safety not the vaccine, however, the vaccine did cause the black out. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.  Information about the Lot/batch number has been requested.

Began to feel flu like symptoms approx 1800 on the evening of 1/19/21. Symptoms worsened through the night rapidly, beginning with uncontrollable chills/shivering, body aches, restless, slight vertigo, weakness/fatigue. At approx 0100 the morning of 1/20/21, blacked out while in the bathroom of which awoken and found myself disoriented, weak, and on the ground (no injuries noted as i must have eased myself down).  I was able to hydrate afterwards and tolerate eating some dry cereal to help with the weakness. Symptoms began to dissipate while an intense headache continued throughout the night and even through the daytime. The time is now 1020 on the day of 1/20/21 and i still have quite the headache but all other symptoms seem to be relieved at this time.

Led to development of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade physiology, atrial flutter, and subsegmental pulmonary embolism. Workup of other causes of pericardial effusion (e.g., infection, malignancy, autoimmune), and hypercoagulability were otherwise negative. 2nd dose of vaccine was on 1/4/2021 and pericardial effusion was diagnosed and evacuated on 2/14/2021. Patient hospitalized from 2/14/2021-2/17/2021. Patient is also healthcare provider.

Woke up morning of 2/19 and observed extensive petechiae and bloody nose consistent with low platelet count and ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura). I was previously diagnosed with ITP and platelet count was 262k confirmed by blood work a couple days before 2nd vaccine. Morning after got blood draw confirming platelets dropped to below 1k. Medical emergency and sent to ER. Admitted and received emergency treatment to increase platelet counts. Ended up requiring splenectomy on 2/22/21. Just discharged from hospital. Multiple medical providers advised me to submit report to VAERS.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient was hospitalized for admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident) on 08Apr2021 in ICU currently/still as of 11Apr2021, not yet recovered. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 18Mar2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 08Apr2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of admitted with stroke (cerebrovascular accident). A 36 year old brother in law of my friend. He had symptoms of an illness (perhaps covid like symptoms) starting on 19Mar2021 (between his 1st &amp; 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech). He went ahead and got his 2nd dose on 21March2021. He then went to see his dr in the last week (week of 05Apr2021 I believe) because of not being well. That primary care dr thought the patient had perhaps been exposed to covid between the 1st &amp; 2nd doses (due to symptoms that the dr thought seemed like body&#39;s over-reaction to covid) but a covid test was done and it was negative. Then the patient has been admitted to (Hospital name) in (city name) (state name) suffering from a stroke on 08Apr2021. He still has not tested positive for covid (again) but he is in ICU at (Hospital name) with stroke symptoms. This was all related to my by the sister-in-law (my friend (name)).

Right away I had the following symptoms briefly: chills and blurred vision. Around 4:20 or so I left in my vehicle. Shortly after, I had a few chills. I needed to use the restroom and pulled into a gas station. After starting to go the bathroom, I quickly began to feel warm and my vision began to blur. The next thing I knew, I opened my eyes laying on the bathroom floor. I then left the restroom and headed to my vehicle where I noticed I had perspiration on my forehead and was really warm.  Over the next hour or so I experienced chills frequently. They have since subsided.

He then sat down (all in a matter of 1 minute)  after about 2 mins of sitting in the chair he fell to the floor.  He cut his head and also bled from his nose.  He became conscious again quickly in less than about 1 minute.  He was then aware of where he was, date and his name.  EMS responded and took over.

A 37-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EL9267) on 26Feb2021 and the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH COVID-19 Vaccine; lot number: EN6202) on 12Mar2021, via an unspecified route of administration on Left Arm at single  dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The administration of first dose of BNT162B2 resulted in Palpitations, dizziness, hyperhidrosis and Syncope the same day of administration. Relevant medical history included allergy to penicillin.  Relevant concomitant medications included testosterone cipionate (TESTOSTERONE CYPIONATE). During second dose of vaccine the patient stated that he feels the medicine in his body, almost to his toes. The patient was fine for a minute or two but then he reported a big rush of the room spinning, struggling to catch my breath, racing heart. EMS personnel was called over and they monitored my heart rate. It was swinging from 120&#43; BPM to 50 BPM in an instant and during the low BPM was when he passed out.   The patient was treated with Epinephrine due a potential reaction and transported to hospital.  The reported events were feeling abnormal, vertigo, dyspnoea, palpitations, heart rate irregular and loss of consciousness. All events were serious as hospitalization and Life-threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event).

At approx. 11:10am (40 minutes after injection) I started to feel tightness in my chest and developed moderate wheezing. I immediately took two puffs of my albuterol sulfate HFA inhaler. The wheezing stopped after I used the inhaler. I did not need to use my epi injector but it was definitely anaphylaxis based on prior experience. I did not report this to the vaccination site as I had already left. It is now 12:45pm and I feel fine.

                                                I received my second shot of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine on Saturday, March 20th at noon.  Saturday at midnight, I woke up in full body sweats and aches.  I took two ibuprofen and tried to go back to sleep, but I would toss and turn in full body sweats and aches for the next 8 hours.  I took another 2 ibuprofen around 400am.  Sunday morning I woke up feeling OK, not great, but OK.  Sunday night ? it was very strange ? the full body chills and aches came back.  Not as bad as Saturday night, but they returned nevertheless.  I had another restless night of sleep, and I took another two rounds of ibuprofen to try and help me sleep.  Monday I woke up feeling OK again.  Monday evening, around 8:00pm, I could feel the full body chills and aches coming back again, creeping up slightly.  This time, I also felt a mild burning in my upper chest and throat.  I went to bed around 8:00pm, then woke up at 9:00pm, this time in a lot of pain.  It felt like burning and a stabbing sensation in my throat and upper chest.  I took some ibuprofen, and tried to fall asleep.  I tossed and turned in agony for the next few hours, apparently falling asleep at some point around 1:00am.  At 2:00am I woke up in severe pain again.  It was very bad, like an 8 out of a 10.  It felt like a burning and stabbing sensation in my lower throat and upper chest.  I had my wife call 911, and I was brought to hospital in an ambulance.  I would stay in the hospital for the next 3 days, getting discharged Thursday at around 5:00pm.  I had peak troponin levels of 5, so I basically had a moderate heart attack.  I had a cardiac catherization procedure done, as well as a cardiac MRI.  The cardiac catherization procedure showed I had no blockages at all in my arteries.  The cardiologists diagnosed me with myocarditis.  The cardiologists told me they believe the vaccine triggered a heavy response from my auto immune system.  The response from my auto immune system in turn caused my heart to become inflamed, giving me myocarditis.  It was a horrible experience, and my doctors are convinced that it was brought on by the second coronavirus vaccine shot that I received.

ER staff were unable to determine the cause of the pain. Exactly one week after the shot (Tuesday), I start sweating profusely and nearly passing out at work. A day later (Wednesday), my heart rate went through the roof and I was dizzy, out of breath. By Friday night I was in an urgent care clinic with a resting heart rate of 145BPM. (My normal is in the 50s). I was diagnosed with Arterial Fibrillation. I have no history, or family history of heart issues. I run 3-5 days a week....3-10 miles at a time.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

On 12/25,   seven days after  receiving the  shot  I started to get right lower leg pain and I kept complaining about it till New Years Day. I had no symptoms of a DVT.  I triaged on 1/1/21 and the doctors  ordered  labs/imaging  and the results were  as followed: D-Dimer  biomarker  (&#43;) , Ultrasound of the Rt lower leg ( - ) ,  CTA showed a PE (segmental right upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with pulmonary embolus). I  was discharged on  Xarelto and advised to follow  up with a hematologist. On 1/5/2021,  I went to hematology and they did a whole bunch of labs. I was sent to get a  ultrasound   of the leg because the pain persist and they found  a clot hidden by my soleus. The plan is to continue on the Xarelto for 6 months. Come back in 3 weeks to scan my leg again and get my lab results.  On 1/12/2021, I received the 2nd shot of the Pfizer vaccination.

Got up in the night to check on my kids, had been standing for about 2-3 minutes when symptoms started, and passed out in the hallway about 60 seconds after symptom onset.  Recovered consciousness within a few seconds, had to lay on the floor for about 5 minutes due to nausea, then got back in bed and went back to sleep.  Woke up 3 hours later and felt completely fine except a little fatigue - all other symptoms had resolved.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

I was initially able to walk from the area where the injection was administered about 50 yards to the observation area. Sat down &amp; shortly thereafter could feel myself getting woozy. I laid my head back &amp; closed my eyes hoping to avoid it. I was given two epinephrine shots the second of which woke me up. Several medical staff were around me when I opened my eyes. I was taken to the patient wing and checked into my own room for observation for a few more hours. Blood was drawn and sent off for a Triptase test which came back negative a couple days later. After being kept under observation for a few hours I was release around noon. I have a history of problems with shots/needles. Haven&#39;t actually passed out from it in over 20 years, but it is a known problem.

                                                Hey guys, just a heads up if you know anyone with a CPAP machine who just received a second dose of the vaccine.   I received the shot on Friday.  No reaction all day.  No reaction all day Saturday.  Saturday/Sunday night I started vomiting into my CPAP mask/machine while still asleep. I wouldn?t have woken up unless my wife was there to hear me choking. She cleaned out my mask and had me lay on my side all night while monitoring me.  Scary stuff. Just thought you should make your friends with apnea aware. I still don?t remember the incident at all. I have a mild fever right now, 99.8. I used to tell my wife she saved my life, but now I don&#39;t mean it figuratively. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I passed out Saturday night.  I was standing in the kitchen and the next thing I knew I was on the ground.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.
