                                                multi-phase anaphylaxis/several anaphylactic reactions; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (parent) from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 17-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), intramuscularly in the right arm, on 17Mar2021 at 12:45 (at the age of 17-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to sticking plaster (adhesive) and diabetes type 1. Family history included allergies to some antibiotics in the mother. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient experienced multi-phase anaphylaxis/several anaphylactic reactions in Mar2021, which caused hospitalization and was reported as an important medical event and life-threatening. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient had multi-phase anaphylaxis following his first dose of vaccination. He went to three different hospitals and was in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at the time of reporting. The patient was heavily sedated, intubated, and on a ventilator for 3 days. The clinical outcome of multi-phase anaphylaxis/several anaphylactic reactions was unknown.   Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information expected.

                                                17-year-old male who presents with 8 days of headache.  He received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 4/21.  He felt like he had the flu after getting the vaccine and developed right-sided neck pain and a temperature to 100.  The patient did endorse being elbowed in the neck playing basketball during this time as well, as he played in a basketball tournament in right after this.  He got his Covid vaccine in his right deltoid.  He saw his pediatrician on 4/26 and a CT scan of his neck with IV contrast was done and this showed significant diffuse right-sided deep spatial neck edema and right-sided adenopathy.  The pediatrician discussed the findings with ENT who recommended augmentin and a medrol dosepak.  The patient developed a headache several days after this and went to urgent care for evaluation.  There was concern that the augmentin and steroids had caused the headache, so the steroids were stopped and he was switched to keflex on 4/30.  He was given phenergan and toradol at Urgent Care and discharged home.  His mom notes that several days ago he had fevers of 101-104.  He has not had a fever for several days now.  His headache continued and he felt unwell at basketball practice so he returned to urgent care on 5/4.  A CT scan of his head was done which showed right sigmoid and transverse sinus thrombosis as well as thrombophlebitis of the right IJ. He was sent to ED for further management at that time.  In the ED, the patient was hemodynamically stable and well-appearing.  The CTs were overread by our radiologists here.  The patient had some labs done at the outside urgent care but PT/PTT/INR and a CRP were drawn here, which were unremarkable.  A Covid PCR is negative.  Neurosurgery, neurology, and hematology were consulted.  Neurology recommended heparin and a hypercoagulable workup and hematology agreed with this plan.  The patient was admitted to the ICU for neuro checks and monitoring during initiation of heparin.

Symptoms included body aches, runny nose and general malaise. However, over the last few days he has felt worse and developed more congestion, cough, and sweating. He did improve a little bit 2 days ago but then started to feel worse yesterday and had a worsening cough that is resulting in some chest tightness. Cough is productive sounding. Mom describes it as barking. No appreciable wheezing but he sounds hoarse. He has some SOB after coughing repeatedly. He states it simply feels like it is hard to breathe for 10-20minutes after a coughing attack but then it resolves. He developed sweating yesterday as well. He states he will just start sweating for no reason. No measured fever. No chills. Today he has dried skin and cracked lips from blowing/wiping his nose all the time. No fevers. No vomiting.

                                                After 1st shot; Patient developed multiple blood clots (lungs and legs) about 10-11 days afterwards. All tests for cause of clots were inconclusive.   Patient received his second dose and with in 48 hours was hospitalized for appendicitis.   If it was a reaction after just one shot, I would normally think it was a coincidence. With him have severe reactions after both shots, it seems very suspicious!

By Saturday, 4/17, the pain was severe enough to warrant a trip to the emergency room. After receiving an ultrasound of my leg, two blood clots were found in my left calf. One fully occluded a vein and another partially occluded a different vein.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

                                                heart failure; heart attack; fluid in his lungs; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 19-year-old male patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 25Mar2021 (received at the age of 19-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing seasonal allergies and cardiac murmur he had as an infant. When probing medical history, the consumer reported that as an infant, her son, had a heart murmur. Her son saw a heart specialist in (State) who did an ultrasound/sonogram of her son&#39;s heart. The specialist said the heart murmur was fine and nothing needed to be done. She also adds that for family medical history, she and her husband don&#39;t have any early onset heart issues in either side of their families. She also reported that her son has horrible seasonal allergies. Concomitant medication(s) included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; triamcinolone acetonide (NASACORT) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; montelukast (MONTELUKAST) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The reporter stated that her son (patient) had a heart attack (26Mar2021) after receiving the first dose of bnt162b2. The patient also experienced heart failure on 28Mar2021 and had fluid in his lungs on Mar2021. She called regarding the COVID-19 vaccine on behalf of her 19-year-old son who received his first vaccine on 25Mar2021. Her son received his first Covid 19 vaccine at a PRIVACY where he attends college. On Friday, 26Mar2021, he was feeling crummy, on Saturday, 27Mar2021, he was feeling crummy. On Saturday night, 27Mar2021, her son started texting her around 11:30PM saying he had pain in his left shoulder and left arm. He had already taken 2 Advil and it wasn&#39;t helping with the pain, her son asked if he could take a third Advil. The reporter told her son he could take a third Advil because it had been an hour and a half since he had taken the first two Advil. The texts from her son continued. He was getting no relief. He took a hot shower and tried self-massage and warm compresses. He ended up throwing up and he said he felt a little better. Her son tried to lay down and couldn&#39;t get any relief from his pain. The pain was tremendous in his left shoulder and arm. Her son told his mother, he thinks he needs to go to the emergency department. His mother is two hours away from him and told him to call 911. Her son had a friend take him to the emergency department instead of calling 911. Her son went to PRIVACY. While at the emergency department, the doctor thought that her son&#39;s pain was muscular. Her son received an injection of Toradol. Her son was discharged from the emergency room and went back out to his friend who had brought him to the hospital. Her son and his friend didn&#39;t even make it out of the emergency department parking lot when her son suddenly couldn&#39;t see anything. His eyes were wide open and all he could see was black. His ears started ringing. Her son went back into the emergency department. Her son received Benadryl and an Epi-pen thinking maybe he was allergic to the Toradol and having a reaction to the Toradol. Her son had blood work, an EKG, and vital signs done in the emergency department on 28Mar2021. His blood work were over 3000 which the reporter reports, indicates a heart attack. The emergency room doctor did not think the Toradol would have pushed his Troponin levels that high. With her son complaining to her about the pain in his left shoulder radiating into his left arm and throwing up, those are signs of a heart attack. Her son was maybe playing off the seriousness of the pain he was experiencing. It was agreed at that point it might be her son&#39;s heart. She was about 18 minutes away from the hospital when she received a call from the hospitalist, the doctor taking care of her son. And that doctor tells her that her son is not doing well and is not responding to treatment of the bag of saline fluids. The doctor is trying to get her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate back up. The doctor was afraid he might have to air flight him to the PRIVACY hospital. She told the doctor she is 18 minutes away and asked if he can wait that long or does she have to turn around and drive the opposite direction to the PRIVACY. At this point her son was having a COVID-19 viral test in case he needs to be transported to the other hospital. The doctor tells her that her son can wait the 18 minutes until she gets to the hospital. She arrived at the hospital and wanted to see her son, her son is on high flow oxygen and she has to gown and glove up to be in his room for fear of Covid particles since he&#39;s on the high flow oxygen. His COVID-19 viral test results have not come back at this time. Her son was admitted to the hospital for heart failure. He was in the hospital for 5 days. He was admitted in the wee hours of the morning on 28Mar2021. During the time he was in the hospital he had chest x-rays and he was given Lasix to get the fluid off his lungs. His white blood cells were way up so he was given an antibiotic. He had an MRI, Chest X-rays, and a Heart Catheterization through his wrist that would indicate that he had blocked arteries in his heart. He had no blocked arteries. The heart catheterization revealed an artery going into his 4th heart chamber was slow to open and close. The cardiologist prescribed Metoprolol for six months with monitoring. The cardiologist feels the Metoprolol will repair his artery and get his blood pressure and heart rate numbers where they need to be. He was admitted to the hospital at around 3:00AM on 28Mar2021 and was discharged on 01Apr2021. Her son&#39;s COVID-19 viral test came back negative, but his COVID-19 antibody test showed that he did have COVID-19 antibodies. The doctor didn&#39;t know if that meant that her son had a previously undiagnosed case of the COVID-19 virus or if he developed COVID-19 antibodies that soon after he received the Covid 19 vaccine. She reported when her son was discharged, he was feeling better, but still had residual fluid at the bottom of his lungs. Her son did have to go for a chest x-ray on Tuesday, 06Apr2021, after he was discharged, to make sure the fluid was making its way out of his body. When he was discharged from the hospital, he had some shortness of breath and he was tired and weak feeling. The pain in his left arm began before he was admitted to the hospital. The shortness of breath started during his hospital admission. At this point in time she would say her son has improved. The Metoprolol he was prescribed by the cardiologist is one half of a 25mg tablet once at nighttime. She stated that she does not have any information on how low her son&#39;s blood pressure and heart rate were during his time in the hospital. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the adverse events. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

A 23-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 25Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3247), as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was vaccinated in the hospital. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient did not have known allergies. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Previously the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EL0142) on 04Jan2021 at 11:30 AM in left arm and experienced nodule on extremity and vaccination site nodule. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis leg (medically significant, life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, nodule on both forearm (life threatening) on 25Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered. It was reported that within hours from second dose the nodules reappeared. At this time, patient was told to take Allegra and did so for 4 weeks. A month later, patient began to see some swelling along his veins and they became painful. This developed into a DVT, deep venous thrombosis, in leg and 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg. all the events required physician office visit. None of the events occurred at vaccination site, but physician believed they were triggered by receiving the vaccine. Treatment of Eliquis was initiated the day before report. Patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Patient, &#34;Starting just hours after the vaccine I felt exhausted. I slept for a long time and woke up the following day with the standard arm pain but I also had extreme fatigue and a headache as well as a productive cough. That lasted for over 48 hours. On the third day I had fatigue, cough, body aches and a headache. I received a rapid  covid test on the 31st that was negative and the nurse practitioner said that she believed that I was either having a bad reaction to the vaccine or bronchitis or pneumonia. Last night I had all of the same symptoms as days prior as well as tightness in my chest and a obvious upper respiratory infection.&#34;
