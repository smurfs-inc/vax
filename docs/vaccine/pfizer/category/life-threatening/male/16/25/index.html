                                                Patient walked out fine after receiving the vaccine. Was able to walk up to the registration desk and carried a conversation with the staffs. He sits down in the waiting area to be monitored. We heard his phone dropped, looked up and saw him tilting over on the right side was about to fall off the chair. Staff grabbed him and held him back onto the seat, proceeded to picked up his right arm and held him in place. He looked unconscious while staff held him. He came back to his senses approximately 10 seconds later. After he regained consciousness, staff took his blood pressure which was 111/44, SpO2 was 100%, and heart rate 58. Patient looked pale but not critical. Conversed with our staff and stated that this has happened before when he receives other vaccinations. Patient&#39;s father is a physician and reported that the patient is scared of needles and did not need any medications from anaphylaxis kit or crash cart. We gave him water and he left after sitting for a while.

On the third day I had fatigue, cough, body aches and a headache. I received a rapid  covid test on the 31st that was negative and the nurse practitioner said that she believed that I was either having a bad reaction to the vaccine or bronchitis or pneumonia. Last night I had all of the same symptoms as days prior as well as tightness in my chest and a obvious upper respiratory infection.&#34;
