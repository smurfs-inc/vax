Presented for routine heart transplant follow up visit 3/22/2021 and was found to have new decreased cardiac function by echo, new 1st degree heart block by ECG, and new gallop.  Patient taken to cath lab 3/22/2021 for biopsy and hemodynamic assessment, but he had V fib arrest with anesthesia induction.  After initiation of CPR, patient was placed on ECMO.  Biopsy shows ACR 2R (moderate cellular rejection) and pAMR 2 (moderate antibody-mediated rejection).  Labs show new donor specific, complement-fixing Antibody against the cardiac allograft.  Patient is in ICU being treated for acute rejection.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

While in parking lot, patient experienced blurring of vision, lightheadedness, nausea, SOB, and left-sided chest pain with return for re-evaluation. Pt treated for possible allergic reaction and concurrent EKG and blood work showed elevated troponin and transient ST elevation. Cardiology consulted and evaluated patient to have severe acute onset systolic heart failure, cardiogenic shock with pulmonary edema, Idiopathic fulminant myocarditis with myonecrosis, and hypoxic respiratory failure. Placed on furosemide, supplemental oxygen, and pending MRI.

                                                Approximately 7-10 days or so after receiving the first dose of the pfizer Covid vaccine I started to develop this red, nodule-like, painful &#34;rash&#34; on both of my forearms. Not only the left arm where the vaccine was administered. This did not go away after a couple of days, and I was instructed by a physician to being taking Benadryl. This appeared to alleviate the symptoms (no visible red nodules anymore)  4-5 days prior to my second dose, so I stopped the medication and presumed it was done. Then, within 4-5 hours of receiving my second Pfizer covid vaccine, I broke out into the same red, painful, nodule-like &#34;rash&#34; along both of my forearms. This time was worse than the previous reaction. I was instructed to take Allegra at the time by a physician, which I did for approximately 4 weeks. This seemed to get rid of the symptoms I was experiencing, and I could not visualize the nodules on my forearms anymore. However, after approximately 2 weeks, I noticed a painful and swollen vein in my right forearm, opposite arm to the one I received the vaccine in. I did not think much of it at the time, since I had no other associated symptoms. Then, over the next couple of weeks, it appeared to become more swollen and painful. Also, I saw another swollen vein near my knee. On April 6, I had labs drawn and CBC, CMP, TSH, and ESR came back normal, but the CRP was elevated. Thus, I was instructed to begin aspirin 325mg, which I took for 4 days beginning April 8th and ending April 12th. On April 13th, an official ultrasound confirmed a DVT in my right popliteal vein, a superficial thrombus in my proximal great saphenous vein, and a superficial thrombus in my right forearm where the pain originated from weeks prior. The initial presumption at this time is that the clots are vaccine-related, but could be linked to an underlying blood disorder that was triggered by the vaccine. Blood hyper coagulation labs have not yet come back. I was initiated on Eliquis starting April 12th for the DVT.

A 23-year-old male patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 25Jan2021 (Lot Number: EL3247), as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient was vaccinated in the hospital. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient did not have known allergies. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Previously the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EL0142) on 04Jan2021 at 11:30 AM in left arm and experienced nodule on extremity and vaccination site nodule. The patient experienced deep vein thrombosis leg (medically significant, life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, nodule on both forearm (life threatening) on 25Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, swelling along veins and they became painful (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered, 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg (life threatening) in 2021 with outcome of not recovered. It was reported that within hours from second dose the nodules reappeared. At this time, patient was told to take Allegra and did so for 4 weeks. A month later, patient began to see some swelling along his veins and they became painful. This developed into a DVT, deep venous thrombosis, in leg and 2 superficial venous thromboses, one in arm and another in leg. all the events required physician office visit. None of the events occurred at vaccination site, but physician believed they were triggered by receiving the vaccine. Treatment of Eliquis was initiated the day before report. Patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

I slept for a long time and woke up the following day with the standard arm pain but I also had extreme fatigue and a headache as well as a productive cough. That lasted for over 48 hours. On the third day I had fatigue, cough, body aches and a headache. I received a rapid  covid test on the 31st that was negative and the nurse practitioner said that she believed that I was either having a bad reaction to the vaccine or bronchitis or pneumonia. Last night I had all of the same symptoms as days prior as well as tightness in my chest and a obvious upper respiratory infection.&#34;
