I began to feel fatigue around 7 pm that afternoon and fell asleep. When I woke up at midnight on 12/30/20 I noticed numbness beginning in my left foot and spreading into my face over a course of 30 minutes. I never noted any muscle weakness, but felt a tingling sensation on the left side of my body. Then I began to experience chills and sweating. I was able to return to sleep around 2 AM. When I woke up at 5:30 the numbness had resolved.

                                                On 12/24 at around 10 PM, circulation to my 4th left digit significantly decreased after being outside of my car for around 15 minutes during a temperature of about 50 degrees. I realized when sharp pain was felt at the digit. After about 5 minutes the digit felt numb. I got in my car, turned on the heater, and massaged my finger. Sharp pain was felt again as circulation returned to the digit. The event last approximately 10 minutes from the moment I realized the finger was pale until color returned.   This occurred again on 12/27 at around 2 PM as I walked from my car into a store at a temperature of about 40 degrees. This time, discoloration occurred bilaterally on my left 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits and my right 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th digits.  The event lasted more than 15 minutes with constant massaging.   This has occurred two more times since then, both times occurring bilaterally with minimal exposure to cold.

After 48 hours I had a lot of pain in my injection arm and my armpit lymph nodes were swollen. I treated the pain with Advil and a heating pad. 72 hours after the vaccine I felt faint, dizzy, and nauseous. I began to vomit and have diarrhea that entire night and next morning. I felt very weak and was unable to keep any foods or liquids down. I was unable to walk around. I took Zofran 8mg which helped with the severe nausea and weakness.  These symptoms are ongoing.

                                                On 01/07/2021 I woke up  at 0300am with chills, headache, body aches, joint pain, fever of 101.2 and swollen left axillary lymph nodes. I took Tylenol and Benadryl and it relieved the fever/headache/body aches/joint pain, however the lymph nodes in my left axillary remained swollen. I continue to take Tylenol for the fever/body aches/pains without relief for the swollen and painful axillary lymph nodes. Warm  compresses do help to relieve the pain temporarily but they remain painfully swollen. On 01/08/21 I called my doctors office to ask if it was normal to experience such painfully swollen axillary lymph nodes to which they stated ?we don?t know, it is too soon for us to tell what?s normal and what isn?t normal right now.? They did not offer any suggestions to relieve the pain or swelling. The morning of 01/09/2021 , I called Employee Health at my hospital (my place of work and also where I received the vaccine) and they also stated they didn?t know if this was a normal reaction due to the newness of the vaccine. A couple hours later, employee health emailed me a link to the VAERS reporting website and asked me to file a report.

                                                Approximately 15 min after vaccination began to experience tingling sensation under tongue. It was not bothersome so I proceeded to go home. At 2:04 pm, approximately 40 minutes after vaccination was driving home and began to experience an elevated HR, shortness of breath/difficulty breathing and throat tightness. Proceeded to pull over to a gas station and felt extremely weak when trying to walk and a tingling sensation all over.  Took 25 mg of Benadryl tablets and symptoms began to subside within about 10 minutes or so. Proceeded to continue driving home and had another episode at 2:49 pm, experienced significant shortness of breath and tingling sensation in mouth spread to back of tongue and it felt swollen. I bought liquid Benadryl instead and took ~20 mL. This episode resolved within 10-20 minutes as well and was okay for the rest of the evening.

After 15 minutes the dizziness did not go away and my vitals were checked. My BP was elevated 136/106 and HR 105, I was taken to the ED after repeated BP readings continued to show increased diastolic pressure. I was observed in ED for a period of almost 6 hours. Within an 1.5 hours after receiving vaccine, I had right neck stiffness, headache, and some weakness to the right side as well along with the dizziness and high BP. I received a 1L bolus of NS, 2 doses of antivert, Toradol, Zofran and Lidocaine patches. 24 hours after receiving vaccines, I was having pain at the insertion site, headache, neck stiffness and occasional dizziness. After 36 hours my symptoms subsided and I felt back to baseline.   Vaccine Dose 2 01/07/2020: I received my second dose of the COVID vaccine and within the first 15 minutes I experienced dizziness, nausea, flashing spots in vision, right sided weakness, increased BP &amp; HR, redness and sweating. After 30 minutes the symptoms did not subsided and I was taken to the ED. An hour after receiving the vaccine, I had right sided weakness to arm and legs with no numbness, dizziness, R. sided neck stiffness, right sided headache, nausea and flashing spots. I received Ativan, Reglan, Tylenol, Toradol and Benadryl in the ED. I was in ED for 3.5 hours after vaccines was administered and was able to ambulate to the car independently.   16 hours after receiving vaccine, I had muscle weakness to bilateral lower extremities and was unable to ambulate independently along with dizziness, headache, arm soreness, cough, congestion, neck stiffness and fatigue. 36 hours after vaccine I regained movement to bilateral lower extremities however still was experiencing fatigue, occasional dizziness, intermittent neck stiffness and headache, body aches and some shakiness to lower extremities. 55 hours after receiving vaccine I was still fatigued and experiencing intermittent headache and neck stiffness. 72 hours after vaccine I was still fatigued and having occasional headaches but feeling much much better from initial reaction. 96 hours after receiving vaccine I experienced occasional headache, woke up with neck stiffness and was finally able to drive a car without any dizziness or nausea. 144 hours after vaccine I am not completely back to baseline still fatigued with occasional neck stiffness and headache but able to go back to work.

                                                12 hours after administration, woken up from sleep by tingling, throbbing in lower legs. Described as a nerve and muscle ache/throb, or &#34;growing pains&#34;/RLS symptoms. Put on compression socks which helped, but still too uncomfortable to sleep. Was able to sleep after taking ibuprofen 800mg and drinking water. 6 hours after the ibuprofen was administered, pain returned in lower legs as well as neck/ears  with body temperature swings (cold, teeth chattering to sweating uncontrollably in a few minutes). After 1 hour of trying to sleep but failing, put compression socks back on. Temperature rose to 100-100.2 F, chills causing whole body to shake under multiple blankets. Tingling/muscle pains extremely uncomfortable and unable to rest, took another ibuprofen 800mg and water and was able to sleep. Tingling and muscle pains have continued as soon as ibuprofen wears off and come back more intense each time, most notably in the lower legs and near ears/neck and elbow of arm administered in (similar to &#34;tennis elbow,&#34; assumed to be provoked by inflammation, happened with first dose).

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

                                                Within 24 hours of getting my 2nd COVID vaccine, I began to feel weak and achy. My neck and face got really hot while the rest of my body stayed cold. A small headache began to turn into a migraine. During the night, my body began to hurt beyond achy causing me to toss and turn. When I woke up in the morning, I couldn&#39;t stand even the littlest of pressure placed on my body. For example, my cat jumped on my leg and it felt like someone wacked me with a baseball bat because of how sensitive my body was. The only treatment used for myself during this time was Tylenol. It helped with the head aches. Overall, it took me about three nights to actually feel ok again.

A 26-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiration date was unknown), intramuscularly on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 14:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was at the workplace clinic. Relevant medical history included COVID-19, which was diagnosed prior to vaccination and migraines (before). The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medication included melatonin. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 30Dec2020 at 15:45 or 1 hour after the vaccine injection, the patient had an aura like a bad migraine and she had bright spotty vision in the peripheral right field for 15-20 minutes; the patient has had migraines before, but they&#39;re not common for her. Two hours after the vaccine, on 30Dec2020 at 16:45, the patient had mental confusion and an inability to speak; she tried to say things to her husband and it was a jumbled, meaningless string of words. She also felt very cold and she had tingling around the mouth. Her husband thought she was having a stroke and called 911 on 30Dec2020. All her vitals were stable, and within 10 minutes she could speak again. On 30Dec2020, the patient&#39;s electrocardiogram (EKG) showed peaked T waves, common with dehydration and high potassium. She was encouraged to go to the emergency room (ER). Instead of taking the ambulance, she drove herself several hours later. The patient wanted someone to tell her it wasn&#39;t a stroke. After a brief neurological exam on 30Dec2020, the doctor said it was likely a severe migraine and wrote the reason for her visit as a vaccine reaction. This took place in the late evening to early morning, and she missed one day of work. The events did result in an emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient did not receive any treatment for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from all the events on 31Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event stroke with BNt162b2 can not be fully excluded.

Otherwise hemodynamically stable on exam ambulates with no difficulty no focal neurologic deficits. Patient did describe on her initial presentation that she noted some weakness of her bilateral legs. Given her possible viral reaction and description of weakness it is possible the patient is developing an early autoimmune reaction however she has no evidence of GuillainBarré or transverse myelitis on my exam. We will plan to discharge with neurology follow-up as outpatient.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

I got my vaccine at around 3, and didn&#39;t have any immediate reaction. I have an exercise bike at home, and tried to work out but had to stop after only half an hour of very low effort biking because I couldn&#39;t get a deep breathe. usually I can bike for an hour at high intensity no problem and have never had to stop because I felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.  I woke up in the middle of the night feeling achy and unwell. When I woke up in the morning I was extremely fatigued and my eyes were itchy and puffy.

                                                The morning after getting the 2nd COVID-19 vaccination, I walked to work and started to feel more fatigued than usual within about 40 minutes after starting to walk from my apartment at 0600. I had a hard time staying awake, started to become flushed and feeling feverish at 0700 at work, and began to develop a headache and nausea around 0745. I went to sick call on my ship after realizing I couldn&#39;t power through the symptoms around 0800, and my Senior Chief  mentioned earlier in the report) sent me home with motrin, tylenol, and mucinex for any congestion that may come up. Today (14JAN21) I seem to be a little more active and have an easier time staying awake, the headache and nausea have dissipated completely. However, I am still feeling more fatigued than I have been lately, and I began to feel flushed and feverish again around the same time in the morning.

Majority of the spots appears within the bra line of the patient, started about a week and a half after the first done (1/22/21) but became increasingly worse two days after the second dose (was received on 2/12/21).  First there were many more on the trunk with some patches increasing in size and rash starting to appear on arms and legs as well. Tried benadryl, fexofenadine, and hydrocortisone which helped minorly. Sought medical advice in the clinic (5 days post second dose) and couldn&#39;t identify other source of rash (no new product, no bugs bites, etc). Was prescribed triamcinilone acetate cream to help relive itching and redness, which as of 2/24/2021 is improving slowly.

                                                Less than 5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I experienced tingling in my left fingers. Less than 15 minutes of receiving the Covid-19 Pfizer vaccine, I experienced chest tightness and shortness of breath.  I thought I was having an asthma attack, so I proceeded to use my inhaler. After using the inhaler, I started coughing while trying to breathe.  Next my tongue started swelling, followed by my throat and back of the tongue.  The nurses / EMT reported that my face turned red and my heart-rate was elevated.  The EMT proceeded to give me EpiPen, which almost instantly caused the swelling in my tongue to go down.  While being monitored for 3 more hours at the emergency room, the swelling went down even more and breathing became more normal.  The following day, I visited my allergist doctor, and I was still experiencing some swelling in my neck and chest tightness.  I was given a steroid shot, which seemed to clear the rest of the allergic reaction.

While sleeping I could feel that I had chills and felt very warm. Woke up at about 0200 to take my temperature. Felt dizzy when I got up, still had a headache and a fever of 101.0 (taken orally). Contacted a nurse triage line to ensure I can take t=Tylenol to bring the fever down and get rid of the headache. She said yes, which is when I took 500mg Extra Strength Tylenol rapid release. Continued to feel not so well, and broke my fever around 0630 timeframe. Once I woke up around 0900 (day after administration) still felt a little warm  (99.5)  and a mild headache. Will keep an eye on any other adverse reactions.

The muscle aches lasted about 24 hours. The injection site was my left arm and I now have swelling in my left axilla which started the evening of 1/6/21 and is still currently swollen. I am an ultrasound technologist and was able to scan myself this morning when I came back to work. It appears I have a cluster of reactive lymph nodes in the area of swelling within my left axilla, the largest measuring 3.0 cm. It is very tender in the area of swelling and the pain radiates down my left arm. I had a lot of pain at the injection site that lasted for about 24 hours, it is now subsiding. However, for the last 24 hours it has been very painful to bend my arm. Any time I tried to bend my arm it sent a throbbing pain down to my left hand, it is still occurring today.

A 28-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EJ1685), intramuscularly in the left arm on 17Dec2020 at 11:00 (at the age of 28-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medications included famotidine and fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), both for unknown indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient previously took and had an allergy to amoxicillin. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 23Dec2020 at 13:00, the patient developed pain in her left axilla (6 days after vaccination). The patient was able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla. It continued to become more painful requiring ibuprofen and hot compresses. By 31Dec2020, her symptoms had largely resolved. She saw her physician who also felt the lymphadenopathy and had no other explanation than possible vaccine side effect. The clinical outcome of pain in her left axilla, swollen lymph node in her left axilla/lymphadenopathy, able to palpate a swollen lymph node in her left axilla was recovered on 31Dec2020. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                I woke up with chills and diarrhea . I started to sweat out of no where but I didn&#39;t have a fever, towards the end of the night I lost my taste for the next two days.  I still had chills and was sweaty, I believe the second day I had a sore throat.  My boss sent me to get a Covid test and that came back negative.

                                                Immediate arm soreness after injection but otherwise felt fine until about 2130 when over about a 30 minute period onset of fever, myalgias, chills, and nausea. Called off work from my job as a flight nurse at midnight. Tried to sleep it off until about 0430 when the body aches became unbearable. Ate a few bites of yogurt and took 400mg of ibuprofen. No change in symptoms until 0530 when I took a hot shower which helped relieve some muscle pain. Took 400mg ibuprofen again at 1030 with a small snack with no change in pain or fevers. Took hot shower again which helped briefly. Nausea subsided around 1630, enough that I had a small meal of bland food and another 400mg of ibuprofen. By 1700 more tolerable myalgias and fever came down some. 2230 another 400mg dose of ibuprofen, fitful night of sleep waking again at 4am with shooting lower back pain and fever. Took another dose of 400mg ibuprofen and a hot shower. Woke up at 1000am sweaty with mild myalgias and low grade fever. Took another dose of ibuprofen 400mg, 30 minutes later profusely sweaty but afebrile. Fatigued all day and poor appetite until late evening. Woke up next day after better night of sleep at 0730. Mild fatigue and bad heartburn all day and night. Left arm still sore to touch. This morning (1/11) feeling mild heartburn but better.

A 28-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3246), intramuscular in the right arm on 02Jan2021 at 11:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included polycystic ovarian syndrome, prehypertension, prediabetic, and vitamin D deficiency. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took amoxicillin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), erythromycin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates to unknown dates and experienced drug allergy. On 02Jan2021 at 18:00, the patient started having soreness. On 03Jan2021 at 16:45, the patient had nausea. On 03Jan2021, she also had swollen lymph nodes,  was tired all day, and &#34;she just did not feel like herself-like she had the flu&#34;. The patient was not given any treatment for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the soreness, nausea, swollen lymph nodes, tiredness, and &#34;she did not feel like herself-like she had the flu&#34; were recovering.

I have cold sores in every branch of the trigeminal nerve on both sides and this has been ongoing since 10/25. I even have one on my rib. I started taking 3grams per day of valtrex on 12/8 when there was one by my eye and I am still getting so many cold sores everywhere. I called my clinical trial site and they are not impressed.

                                                I noticed on January 12 that my left arm where I received the shot my bones were aching and my joints (my shoulder, my elbow, my forearm bones, and all my hand joints) were aching and my hand was slightly swollen. My coworker reported aching joints two days after she received the vaccine. So I?m not sure if my aching joints are related to the vaccine but I?m suspicious they are.

I took my temperature twice in the absence of antipyretics and did not have a fever (98.7 and 98.2) but my skin felt hot and painful as it does when I have had a fever in the past. By about 5:00 or around 24 hours post vaccination, all symptoms resolved aside from fatigue and headache, but the headache was less than it was before. I experienced those symptoms for the rest of the evening and woke up this morning feeling completely normal.

Mostly burning sharp pain, but some restricting tight pain as well, radiating to my back mostly. It would be relieved for maybe 10 minutes at a time but then flare back up for about 5 hours. I went to the emergency room, where they did a cardiac work up including blood work and EKG, vitals and a chest X-ray, all which were unremarkable. At about 0200 am on 01/13, the pain subsided. Previous to the chest pain, during the morning and afternoon of 01/12, I had a low grade fever (99.9 F), an intense headache, and fatigue. 01/14/21 sore swollen lymph node under L arm.

Took Benadryl 50mg before bedtime.  2 days after vaccine: woke up with voice changes, coughing/choking with speaking. Used epipen once, felt full relief for about 1-2 hours. Trouble speaking again. Then went to ER, had epipen again twice, over two hours, Benadryl 50IV and Pepcid and steroids. Sitting in the ER now debating admission. Likely being admitted., home epipen are too expensive to treat q2h by myself.

                                                Developed a rash around my neck and swollen eyes (thought to be poison ivy) on 1/3/2021. Since that time, the rash has spread to my back, abdomen, chest, neck, ears. It appears to be urticaria and is extremely itchy. I completed a steroid taper early on and the rash is no loner affecting my face. I am taking daily antihistamines and using hydrocortisone cream for the itching. The rash continues to spread and is made worse with scratching.  I am unsure if this is related to the vaccine, but this has never happened before and I have no known allergies. I got the second vaccine on 1/8/2021 (at the time the rash was improving and I thought it to be poison ivy).

                                                I received the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine on 1/8/2021. The following day I had mild hives on my neck and thigh creases, I attributed it from sweating, hives went away after taking Claritin. The evening of 1/11/2021 I had 1 glass of wine and subsequently broke out into hives all over my chest and neck, took Benadryl that night. In the morning of 1/12/2021 the hives had worsened. I started Prednisone 40mg, Claritin, Pepcid 20mg in the AM and Prednisone 20mg, Benadryl, Pepcid 20mg at night. The following day the hives had mostly resolved and I only took the OTC medications. In the afternoon of 1/13/2021 I rode my stationary bike. After the ride I had broke into hives again on my chest and neck and where my headband sat. I then took Prednisone 40mg, Benadryl 25mg, Pepcid 20mg. Hives have mostly resolved today 1/14/2021, still have the sensation of itchiness. Never had throat closing or shortness of breath.

It was not one of the possible reaction from covid vaccine but rather administrator error in injecting the vaccine.  The symptoms appeared about 3 hours after receiving the vaccine,  now have numbness, tingling, pain and burning sensation on my left pam in the arm of given vaccine.   Obviously, the person giving the vaccine, hit the nerve.

After the observation period, she left the facility and started to notice tightness and what she describes as a &#34;bubble&#34; at the top of her throat. She also noticed a tingling sensation in the top of her lip, but did not notice any swelling. Reporter took 25 mg of liquid Benadryl and within an hour the sensation in her throat began to go away. Reporter received the second COVID-19 vaccine on 1/20/2021 at 08:25 AM. She had proactively taken diphenhydramine following the reaction to her first dose. Around 08:40 AM, she began to feel tightening in her throat and some heaviness in her chest. She was evaluated by a nurse who took her blood pressure (normal), however, her heart rate was elevated (noted this could be that she was nervous following initial reaction and repeat tightness in throat). Around 08:55AM, she began to feel like her tongue was swelling and that she had a &#34;bubble&#34; on the top of her throat. She was taken to the Emergency Department for evaluation. She was given hydroxyzine, famotidine, and dexamethasone in the ED and was discharged and felt stable. She reported a continued odd sensation in her throat the evening of the second vaccination. This feeling resolved the next day, and she reports no additional side effects from the vaccine.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Next morning, I woke up with severe positional headache (headache with standing or sitting up, resolved completely with ibuprofen and tylenol within 20 minutes). The next morning I also had a sore left deltoid, and soreness extending into my left chest and shoulder, which diminished throughout the day after ibuprofen and tylenol. I also had a left swollen armpit, which I interpreted as swollen lymph nodes. My left armpit was sore and was visibly swollen compared to the right. The left lymph node is still visibly swollen as I report this (approximatley 36 hours after vaccine administration), and is sore but less sore than initially.   Of note, when I received the first vaccine in this series, my left deltoid was more sore than with the second administration, but soreness was limited to the deltoid and resolved within 3 days.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction; hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (Physician Assistant). A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter stated that she is treating a patient in ICU that got the COVID-19 vaccine on 29Dec2020. The patient developed hives in the first 10 minutes of the vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction 1 hour later. Seriousness of events was reported to be hospitalization. Outcome of the events was unknown. The reporter also mentioned that it was not a mild reaction and patient was still in the ICU, 48 hours later.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylactic reaction and hives cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 29-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number EL1284/expiration date: not provided), via intramuscular route of administration in the right arm, on 30-DEC-2020 at 11:30 AM (at the age of 29 years old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Relevant medical history was none. The patient did not have any known allergies to medications, food, or other products. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication (other medications taken in two weeks) were none. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On an unknown date, the patient experienced right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy - five freely mobile lymph nodes, tender to palpation, roughly 1 cm in size. The patient did not receive treatment for the event right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The outcome of the event right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy was not recovered. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Since I have extensive family history of brear cancer and lymphoma I got lab work and a CT scan with contrast of my chest and neck.  Labwork (cbc, cmp, ana, crp) was normal. Peripheral smear showed increased in Roloux phenomenon. CT showed unilateral generalized lymphadenopathy on axillary, infraclavicular, supraclavicular and cervical region. With some noted measuring &gt; 1cm.

                                                1/8/21 - 15 minutes after second dose of COVID19 vaccine I had flushing (warm rash like) all over my chest and neck that lasted for about an hour. No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

                                                During the first few hours following vaccination, I had soreness at the injection sight and a mild headache. About 10hours later, I started to experience more severe symptoms including a fever of 101-102deg, chills/cold sweats, a moderate headache, and body aches. This continued throughout the night and into the next day. In addition, I began to experience a burning sensation in my chest, similar to heart burn. I have consistently been taking Tylenol and recently took Tums to aide with the heartburn feeling.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea and decreased appetite. This persisted throughout the entire next day following vaccination. The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

But at night I started wheezing, had sweats and chills, did not check my temperature but I had pretty severe chills that night. In the morning I checked no fever, but still chills, severe cough and sore throat.. Headache and fatigue.  All got worse more severe on Saturday and then I decided to go get tested for Covid on the Care Clinic. I had a known exposure to COVID before I got the vaccine around  01/04/21 - my husband who tested positive on the 6th) I tested positive. All symptoms continued (except the tingling on the mouth it stopped on the 8th) and I saw my OB-GYN on the 11th due to a low amniotic fluid - I had an ultrasound at the facility and was referred to MD and saw him on the 11th as well.  Now I lost my sense of taste and smell. The chills have subsided a little bit and so the headache, but fatigue, congestion and cough are still there. I had increased intermittent shortness of breathe but could be the baby&#39;s position.

Arm soreness was quite severe on 1/8, as it was painful to even lift the left arm for much of the day.  I also noted, about 5 hours after vaccination, that my jaw felt slightly tense, bilaterally.  On Friday, 1/8, I also experienced headache for the entire day, and I was fatigued for much of the day.   I noted clavicular lymph nodes as well.  About 18-20 hours after vaccination, I developed soreness in my back, and about 24 hours after vaccination, I noted some myalgia in the left leg.  These symptoms were responsive to acetaminophen.  The headache, clavicular lymph nodes, arm soreness, and myalgias were resolved by the time I woke up on 1/9.  Finally, I noted development of an axillary lymph node during the evening of 1/8, about 28 hours after vaccination.  This axillary node persisted until Monday, 1/11.

I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

                                                cold sore; body aches; They have worsened as the day went on; stress; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient, Physical Therapist) from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A 29-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included cold sores. Concomitant medication included valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX) from 2009 and ongoing for cold sores, ongoing fluticasone propionate (FLONASE ALLERGY RELIEF), ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (BLISOVI FE 1/20) from 2006 and ongoing for birth control. The patient previously received first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EH9899) on 15Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced fever and body aches. The reporter wanted to verify if it was an interaction. She didn&#39;t feel like it was a drug interaction. She was questioning if there could be a drug interaction. She took Valtrex for cold sores on her face. She received her second dose of the COVID vaccine yesterday on 06Jan2021. Today 07Jan2021, she got a cold sore this morning and took Valtrex. She was wondering if the Valtrex, being an antiviral, could affect the vaccine in any way. She got the cold sores randomly anyway. They come on because of stress. She has a history with them. Caller didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She got the vaccine through work. This time for second dose she developed body aches only. She received the vaccine yesterday 06Jan2021, and developed body aches today 07Jan2021. They have worsened as the day went on, but she was at work. Since she was home now and not moving around as much they weren&#39;t as bad. She got the vaccine because she worked in a nursing home. She was an essential worker who was at high risk. The outcome of events was unknown.

I am still feeling under the weather but wanted to get these down before I forgot them.

A 29-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE Solution for injection, batch/lot no. and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on arm on unspecified date at a single dose (2nd dose) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out. She lives alone, she is an adult, she hit her nose, got the scar in the nose, and the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop, she was bleeding from that scar. She told me it took two hours for bleeding to stop from that scar.&#34; When asked when the events started, Physician stated, &#34;Last night (08Jan2021), at 4:00 am she took the shot during the day while she was at work. She said, she started to getting chills and then she was nauseated.&#34; When asked if patient was still experiencing the event, the parent reported no as patient was just resting. Also stated, &#34;She didn&#39;t take any treatment but she said she took Tylenol.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;I am concerned, we are going to be taking her to the urgent care now but I am concerned about what is going on with platelets and all of that because of what had happened, last night the bleeding wouldn&#39;t stop for two hours and she was alone at the night and weekends. She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well. I want her to go get checked up as soon as possible in urgent care.&#34; Patient was taking some Ibuprofen (later clarified that patient took Tylenol as treatment). She was not taking any other medication. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

It?s the top 3 to 3 teeth and my gums that feel as if I was getting numbed at the dentist. It still hasn?t gone away I can?t feel my lip and my teeth hurt to chew anything and are sensitive to cold and hot and throbbing. I went to the dentist and they said it was fine. So I?m here reporting it and now I will be going to my PCP. Thank you

I don&#39;t like to take medicine and I had no choice but take Panadol every 4 hours and apply ice to treat the muscular pain. I went to emergency and was told that I had an urine infection  (which is very rare on me), and was treated with antibiotics.   With the second dose I took acetaminophen 500 mg befor the vaccine, that helped because the day of the shot I didn&#39;t have pain, but the numbness was like if I couldn&#39;t connect my body to the brain. Couldn&#39;t talk properly, sleep 2 hours during the day, is funny that I applied ice on the injection site (Me thinking) but the pain doesn&#39;t go away, when the ice melts I notice that I applied the ice on the wrong arm. That&#39;s what I mean when I talk about numbness. Fever of 39.8F and Chills even today . Some cough and dry throat (Dryness can be because I&#39;m a teacher) and constant tiredness.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

Feber has subsided.  Cough, shortness of breath and intermittent wheezing remain as well as some chest pressure, sore throat, headache and chills. Coughing fits are bad enough to cause urinary incontinence but I did give birth 4 months ago so this may not be significant. No signs of allergic reactive such as redness, urticaria or swelling.

Not much longer and the hives/itching spread down my back and chest. Face became swollen. Benadryl cream was initially attempted, but only briefly subsided the itching and reaction continued spreading. I took oral quick release Benadryl and was able to prevent the reaction from continuing. I had to take a secondary Benadryl dose a few hours later and extreme joint pain accompanied the allergic reaction.

                                                For 2 days after the vaccinations, my left deltoid/ upper arm was sore. Approximately 7-8 days after my vaccination, my left armpit started feeling sore. This has continued to today where I have left armpit swelling and what feels to be a swollen, hardened lymph node in my armpit. It feels like a hardened lump that is not fixed and is tender when I palpate it. On visual inspection, I can tell that my left armpit is more swollen than my right armpit (which is normal). It hurts to have my arm at my side and it hurts to lay on my left side at night when I am sleeping.

She reported prior to receiving her flu immunization she would take 50mg diphenhydramine. We had her take 50mg diphenhydramine &amp; then wait 30 minutes prior to receiving the first COVID-19 dose. After receiving the vaccine we had her stay in the room directly in front of us for 30 minutes so we could monitor her. It was noted she seemed to be having difficulty breathing &amp; at that point we administered the first epinephrine 0.3mg dose. She reported feeling better &amp; her color got better. We continued to closely monitor her &amp; in approximately 7 to 8 minutes her breathing became labored again. A second epinephrine 0.3mg dose was administered &amp; we called to have her transported to the hospital.

The next morning I had a fever and my joints, muscles, head and even my skin was hurting. My fever never came down to normal even with advil and I was extremely tired all day.  The arm that had the injection is extremely sore with splotches of red (which is expected.) Today, 01/08, I woke up in a pool of sweat. My head is still hurting and I still have a fever. My arm is still sore but my skin and joint pain has improved. I am still very cold. Have been wearing my winter coat in my house even with the heat and the fire place on. I had to take the last two days off work.

                                                periorbital edema, lip swelling Narrative: ED note: This is a 29 year old employee who got her COVID vaccine yesterday. This morning she noticed facial puffiness, mostly around her eyes. No swelling of lips, toungue, no trouble swallowing or speaking, no swelling of throat, no SOB, no n/v or dizziness. Here she had some mild periorbital puffiness that I would not be aware of if she did not point it out to me. There is no swelling of her lips, airway and no SOB or problems with her voice. Her symptoms are improving in the ER. I think it is unlikely that this delayed symptom is related to the vaccine, however, she also states she had some swelling of the right side of her lip yesterday (none today), so I&#39;m going to prescribe her an epi-pen.

My hands and feet became clammy. A small fan helped subside symptoms momentarily. Within minutes my lower extremities became shaky. I developed chills and felt faint. VS were measured. I was hypertensive (BP 134/100, baseline BP usually runs 110/80s). I developed intermittent tachycardic and heart palpitations, with a max HR of 124. Symptoms lasted approximately 1hour post vaccine administration.  I work at a COVID testing site, chances of me being exposed to COVID-19 are high. I was not tested prior to receiving either dose of the vaccine; however, I have remained asymptomatic for the duration of the series.

Around 2:30am felt pressure and warmth (coming in waves) up towards my chest, lasting 1-2 seconds and occurring about every 5 minutes . Was able to withstand feeling until it became difficult to breath. Lips and face turned white and blue, fainted. Felt extremely nausea when awake.  Called 911. Vitals were normal apart from BP was very high 130/100&#39;s. EKG was NSR. Blood sugar taken was normal around 113. After 1 hour of event, I took a shower and drank water. I felt the wave one more time before trying to fall asleep. Then stopped. Woke up fine.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

The Caller wanted information on side effects specifically looking at platelet or clotting or bleeding issues. Her daughter, (female, age 29 date of birth) received the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, received it at the (State name), last night. She felt very unwell, nauseous, chills, and then blacked out, fell, knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed; fainted and hit her face, didn&#39;t stop bleeding for 2 hours. There&#39;s a humongous scar on her nose. It took 2 hours to stop bleeding. She&#39;s going to urgent care today. Her daughter was healthy, yesterday was 2nd dose. In her hand, there&#39;s a rash with different dots/red. She has petechiae/rash on the forearm. Thankfully it (bleeding) did stop. The outcome of events for &#39;knocked out, hit her nose, started to bleed&#39; was resolved on an unspecified date, for other events was unknown. The case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based solely on a chronological association a causal relationship between events blacked out  and fainted and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), cannot be completely excluded. The case will be reevaluated should additional information become available.

At 14:20 the patient was given Benadryl liquid PO given along with 8oz of water. Patient able to drink without issues. At 15:00, EMS called for ER transport to due prolonged recovery. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events.

The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

A 31-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Dec2020, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient stated she got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Monday, 28Dec2020. She mentioned that she read the list of side effects and all the print outs and stated her events were not on there. She wanted to make sure and stated maybe it was not even from the vaccine. She reported she just came from the hair dresser, had hair colored before many times, but today (30Dec2020), when she put the dye on her hair, she broke out with what felt like a million bugs on her head and face, stated it is burning and itching, maybe it is her imagination. She knows there is a lot of paranoia. She reported that she has had hair colored before and this has never happened, it occurred during hair coloring treatment. She also mentioned that on 30Dec2020 (also reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;, pending clarification), she felt dizzy and nauseous; on 29Dec2020 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;), she felt bad and did not feel right all day, but says she knows those were listed symptoms. The outcome of the events dizziness, nausea, burning sensation and pruritus was recovering; the outcome of events paranoia and feeling abnormal was unknown.

There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including EKG at baseline and during subject drug therapy, echocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, electrolytes, chemistry panel and serum toxicology screen, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My body began to feel tingly all over even my tongue but it never swelled.  I was given 25mg of benedryl and monitored for 30 minutes and finally my body began to normalize and my BP went down to 130/70.  I went back to work but when I got home I took more benedryl because my body still had the same tingly feeling.  After about 24 hours all symptoms had subsided.

I had a little nausea.  I went back to work and finished out the day.  I took more benedryl when I got home to help with the tingling feeling which finally deminished after about 24 hrs.

                                                Developed a &#34;scratchy throat approximately 20 minutes post vaccination. Symptoms worsened and she developed shortness of breath. Required evaluation and treatment in the Emergency Department. Received Benadryl, dexamethaxone, famotidine and solumedrol. Second COVID vaccine, no reaction with the first vaccine. ED provider notes below: This patient presented due to concern for allergic reaction to COVID-19 vaccine and was seen by myself immediately upon arrival.  When in triage the triage nurse noted her oxygen saturation was 81% so she was placed on 2 L nasal cannula and brought directly back to her room.  When placed in the room she was hooked up to the monitor and her oxygen saturation was 100% and I took her off of the nasal cannula and her oxygen saturation remained in the upper 90s.  She had no stridor and respirations were nonlabored.  She was speaking without difficulty and had no vocal changes.  She did not appear to be in any acute distress.  Her posterior oropharynx was widely patent and she had no uvula or tongue swelling or lip swelling.  She did have some blotchiness to the upper chest area but no hives.  Abdomen was soft and nontender.  Pulse was regular.  Blood pressure was stable.  She was nontoxic in appearance.  An IV was established and the patient was given Decadron and Benadryl for initial treatment.

This was controlled 3 hours later by tylenol. For the next 36 hours post symptom onset my sinuses were still affected, my muscles felt very weak and the glands in my neck felt swollen. Everything has resolved except the swollen glands in my neck and my sinsuses being dry and painful.

By 2030 I had severe full body chills and could not stop shaking. I had a severe headache/migraine. Every muscle in my body hurt. This continued on for the entire night. Got tested for COVID the next morning with the rapid results and the symptoms continued with the muscle aches and severe headache. Vision became blurry and I became very dizzy. Slept for 8 hours during the day on 1/7/2021 and then slept another 12 hours that night. The body aches and headaches continued until 1/8/2021 at which the symptoms finally subsided

A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at single dose in deltoid right for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history or concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine on 03Jan2021 and within 15 minutes had a generalized headache. Later that night she had generalized muscle weakness and pain, but really didn&#39;t think too much about it. The next day at work (04Jan2021), she had numbness on the right upper side of her lip and a pins and needle feeling in the right upper quadrant of the face. Had a lot of pain in the area as well on the right upper side of the face as well as a dull aching pain that lasted for hours. Later that day when using the computer and she was trying to reach for her mouse she noticed her right hand wasn&#39;t able to feel anything and that lasted about 20-25 minutes. Kept slapping the mouse with her hand, but could not feel anything, her hand went numb. Yesterday (05Jan2021), she had the same pins and needle feeling in the same area of the face and that dull achy feeling and it occurred for hours and it was very kind of debilitating for her at work.  Later that night she had pain in her right leg and felt the same way, that very severe achiness, which was the pins and needles feeling up and down the leg and underneath the right foot. All these symptoms tend to be on her right side and it definitely lasted for hours. It started about 1 and didn&#39;t end until 6-7pm. It even hurts to move the right eye in one direction and hurts to speak, the pain was so bad. This morning (06Jan2021) she had to call out of work because at 3am the generalized headache, pain was unbearable. She was still experiencing the pain in right leg and bottom sole of right foot. She did not receive any vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in past. She had made an appointment with a neurologist and will have a MRI done on Friday, 08Jan2021. No further details provided. All events required a visit to physician office. All events were reported as serious per medically significant. The outcome of all events was not resolved. The reporter considered all events were related to the vaccine.   Information about Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal relationship, causality between reported events and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be excluded.

                                                On  12/25 I was driving home and my left arm got numb, tingly and weak to the the point where I thought I was suffering from a stroke.  I  rushed to my moms and had her to drive me to the hospital where they did a neuro check to include a CT scan which ruled out the stroke but the symptoms lasted about 4 days which came and went with the pain and intensity varying each time which ended around 12/29.  I suffered from body aches and night chills one night.  Around the 12/29 I began to have pressure around the back of my head which felt as if I was laying on bricks when I laid down.  It got to the point to where I couldnt sleep which caused me to go back to the ER on  1/1 where I was given  toradol, decadron and sudafed which allowed me to sleep. I was released from the ER with Motrin 800 and contined to take that and Tylenol until the headaches ceased  which was about 3 or 4 days later. The headache went away but the pressure still remained.  My lymph glands were swollen so I was also given a prescription for amoloxicillin.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

I took 440 mg of Aleve around 8:30 when the fever did not subside. The fever broke and did not return. I slept most of the day and was unable to work. My left axillary lymph node is still palpable as of today, 1/15.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiration date: Mar2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 07Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included testing positive for COVID in Apr2020. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took flu shot and experienced soreness. The patient did not receive any vaccination within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient called in regards to Pfizer COVID Vaccine. She received her first vaccine last Thursday, 07Jan2021. She was not sure if she can report this as a side effect, but she had some rashes appear just today (11Jan2021), at midnight, in her neck and chest area. The rashes were going away, but she still has some itching. She also stated that she took some over-the-counter diphenhydramine (BENADRYL, UPC: 1254717031, lot number: PJF044, expiration date: Jun2021) tablets to relieve the symptoms. She explained that she started to experience soreness/ pain at the injection site a few hours after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The pain in her arm has already went away. She noticed a swollen lymph in her armpit area on Friday morning, 08Jan2021 and it&#39;s still a little bit swollen. She didn&#39;t expect on getting a rash since she read symptoms only appear around 2-3 days only. Therefore, she is not sure if she can report this as a side effect because its been like 3 days already. She noticed the rash just today, at midnight. She stated that she is still itchy. She stated that there is just a little bit of itchiness in her neck. She felt a little bit warm and itchy in her chest area, at midnight (unspecified date), and she kept scratching. She knows she shouldn&#39;t have done that but it was itchy. The patient would consider these events to be non-serious. She did have some soreness with a flu shot before so it&#39;s not too serious. She explained she is a healthcare worker. She works in a nursing home facility and they asked if she wanted to receive the Covid-19 vaccine and she filled out the form. She also explained that she doesn&#39;t have any allergies to any medications. So, with the rashes that came, she is not really sure what is the cause of it. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. She stated she wanted to report this information but she also needs advice on whether she needs to continue taking Benadryl. Her rash is improving, but she is still a little bit itchy. She doesn&#39;t have any shortness of breath or anything. It&#39;s not a major reaction, just a little bit of a rash/itchiness in her chest and neck area. The outcome of the event vaccination site pain was recovered on 10Jan2021, for lymphadenopathy and rash was recovering, for pruritus was not recovered and for feeling hot was unknown.

I gave her oral  benadryl 50 mg and 40 mg of famotidine oral. The difficulty in breathing did not lessen. She began to use her accessory muscles. Her O2 sats were 99%  via finger pulse oximeter. Breathing became increasingly labored. An Epi pen 0.3 mg was administered. An ambulance was called. Her breathing became less labored, she was transported to the hospital  via ambulance to be checked out.

Very fatigued. At night I threw up and about 2AM I woke up drenched in sweat and I did not take my temperature. I woke up around 7AM and I had a migraine for about 2/3 hours - pounding headache. I took Tylenol, My body was really achy and my arm was like it was dead. General malaise, fatigue, it felt like I had a hangover, from my pounding headache. I threw up once again in the afternoon. Not sure if pregnancy related or the vaccine. Sunday morning I started feeling a little better. Saturday I felt horrible.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient claimed that on the first dose, she felt part of the dose run down her arm or at least had that sensation. The inoculator thinks the complete dose was injected. The patient was upset and wants a recommendation on if she should need a repeat of her first dose. The patient asked if there was any data on repeating the first dose vs. no action and proceed with the second dose in 21 days. Outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I missed a week of week then was released to work again on 1/25/21.

                                                The night of the second dose of my Pfizer Covid vaccine, my face began to feel hot and tight. The next day, I began with the expected flu like symptoms of the vaccine, accompanied by a red, fine bumpy rash with some swelling on my face where it had felt hot and tight the evening prior. The flu like symptoms lasted about 24 hours. The facial rash persisted and I began oral antihistamines - diphenhydramine and famotidine. The rash continued for one full week, only improving after beginning to use topical hydrocortisone on my face at the suggestion of a friend who is a nurse practitioner. After improvement in the rash I stopped hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash reappeared about 5 days later, and continues to randomly reappear about once a week to every 10 days. Flares only last about 24-36 hours now and will go away without medication but it does clear faster with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. The rash only flares at night, and no triggers like heat, alcohol or certain foods seem to bring it out.  I have been consistently taking famotidine and cetirizine daily since the last flare of the rash, and have not experienced a flare again yet.

A 31-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 20Jan2021 13:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included having one thyroid and had a benign tumor removed from behind heart when she was young and birth control. Concomitant medication included benzalkonium chloride, sodium chloride (ALIVE) and desogestrel, ethinylestradiol (ISIBLOOM) for birth control. After taking the shot she got light headed as she was walking to her car on 20Jan2021 15:00. Didn&#39;t think nothing of it since she was nervous about taking the shot. Then once she got home, she got really tired. She only had one thyroid so the shot made me really sleepy and she had a few skipped heart beats while laying down. After she slept, she felt fine but weird then after being up for a few hours she would get restless again. She got light headed again the next day going to the grocery store then back restless. She didn&#39;t feel normal until this Tuesday, she was not feeling weird and she was not as tired as she had been since she took the shot. She had tried to get seen from her doctor but she was booked up. No treatment was received for the events. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. No known allergies. Outcome of the events was recovering.

Fatigue has gone down to where I can resume daily activity  12/29 Wake up with moderate sore throat Stabbing arm soreness at injection site Moderate fatigue  and nausea persist. Mild chills. Tried to go for a walk outside and found a 30 minute very slow walk extremely tough  12/30-1/2 Moderate sore throat continues. Other symptoms gone 1/1-2 Arm/ injection site soreness slowly fades  1/2: exercise for the day= 70 min yoga and 7.5 miles of walking. Had a couple glasses of wine at dinner (possibly relevant if issues with vaccine are related to high histamine food issues)  1/3  Moderate headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Skin feels hot. Sore throat worse than the previous days. Mild runny nose. Severe nausea. Go to Urgent care for COVID test and Zofran Rx. COVID rapid test and PCR test both negative. No fever, higher than usual blood pressure  1/4-5 (current) Nausea lower but still moderate, requiring Zofran. Sore throat persists. Mild fatigue and muscle aches. Skin still feels warm. Mild vertigo during exercise

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

                                                Patient received her covid vaccine on 12/28/2020 in her left arm. Three days after vaccination she had pain and swelling in her right arm. She was seen by a health care provider on 12/31/2020 and an ultrasound showed extensive deep venous thrombosis in the left arm. She was started on a blood thinner (eliquis).  She had blood tests done on 1/1/20 and this showed leukocytosis. She was found to have acute myeloid leukemia and admitted to our service for treatment. We do not have blood tests prior to 1/1/20 so it is unclear when her leukemia started. Her deep venous thrombosis could be related to her acute leukemia but I decided to report it due to the proximity to the time of her vaccine. Her arm pain and swelling improved after administration of the blood thinner. She is currently being treated for her leukemia.

                                                within 1 hr post-vaccine on 1/7 I had a mild headache that resolved with Tylenol. At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

                                                At approximately 5 minutes into the 15-minute monitoring window, I became severely dizzy, flush, and light-headed while simultaneously experiencing right-sided tingling, the altered sensation from my forehead to collarbone (right side only). At approximately four hours post-vaccination my right eye had mild blurriness to my vision. The vision resolved within a few hours but the altered right-sided sensations continued for 6 days, gradually improving.  The lightheadedness and dizziness that required cool clothes and elevated feet resolved enough to stand after 30 minutes.

                                                Severe soreness in left upper arm at location of the shot about 5 hours after the shot, the pain extended into the armpit/lymph area of my left arm and the pain remained steadily severe until Friday 1/15- 3 days after the initial injection. At 1pm on day of shot (1/12/21) had feelings of chills, sweaty and whole body aches. This lasted until Thursday morning 1/14 around 7am. During that time, took Tylenol for the aches and feverish feelings.    Arm soreness finally subsided Friday. migraines started Thursday evening into Saturday morning. With little relief from Imitrex (prescription medication for chronic migraines). Went to the emergency room Saturday for a shot of Torodal for the migraine to subside.

                                                0710 January 19th I received the second does of the Covid -19 vaccine. The site was very sore all day.  Around 2230 that night, I started having intermitted sharp pain in my leg arm pit. 0430 January 20th I woke up with sharp pains still in my left arm pit. By 1030 the pain was now constant and extreme.  I called my doctor and he told me to come into the office to see him. NP saw me and explained that the lymph nodes in my left arm were swollen. Very tender to touch also. He prescribed me Prednisone twice a day for three days, Ibuprofen, and use hot compresses. So far the pain has gotten better.

Exam demonstrated 4/5 strength of left arm and hand. Started prednisone 40mg on 1/11. Swelling, pain, and weakness persisted. Seen in ER 1/15, exam with persistent weakness and lymphadenopathy. MRI brachial plexus performed which showed multiple enlarged nodes adjacent to brachial plexus. No overt inflammation or compression of brachial plexus. Received IV dexamethasone, and PO prednisone course. Finished 10d of prednisone 40mg with improvement in soft tissue edema, but still with residual weakness and pain. EMG pending. Diagnosed with brachial plexopathy secondary to compressive adenopathy from COVID 19 vaccine.

                                                24 weeks pregnant at time of 2nd shot. Shot given at 1430 on 1/27 in left deltoid. Felt great rest of day. @0500 on 1/28 woke up shivering uncontrollably. Mild fever of 100.5(highest recorded during this whole episode). Body aches, chills, sweats, headache rest of day. 1000 mg Tylenol helped with fever/chills but headache progressed to migraine w/nausea. Took 50 mg sumatriptan and 25 mg doxylamine in evening and this seemed to help with headache and allow me to get to sleep 1/28.  Woke up at 0300 1/29 with chills/cold sweats. Took 1000 mg Tylenol again (didn&#39;t check temp) and went back to sleep. Woke up at 0530 for work - checked temp since I&#39;m a healthcare worker and it was 100.4 (with tylenol). Waited until clinic opened up and called them at 0700 for recommendations on going to work or not (temp by then was 99.8, with tylenol). Was advised to stay home and if febrile tomorrow to get COVID tested on 1/30. As of right now (1300 on 1/29) headache has returned but mild. Body aches still. Temp 99.4 w/tylenol redosed at 1000.

A 32-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unknown route, on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation, administered at hospital. Relevant medical history included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD), hypothyroidism and anxiety. Past drug history included allergy to cefprozil (CEFZIL). Relevant concomitant medications included bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN XL), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), and levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID). On 12Jan2021, the patient had tachycardia, facial flushing, fatigue, arm pain and swelling. The events required a physician office visit. Therapeutic measures taken as result of the events included levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). On 14Jan2021, the patient underwent a COVID-19 virus test (nasal swab) which resulted positive. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) on 12Jan2021, and COVID-19 test positive on 14Jan2021.  No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                I received the vaccine in the left arm on 12/23 with no immediate symptoms. On 12/24 I had body aches mostly on my left side. On 12/25, I started having a strong headache, focused mostly on the left side. On 12/26 the headache continued and I also noticed swollen lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, and behind my ears. Also, it felt like someone had broken my nose and when I would try to bite down or chew I would have a sharp pain and pressure in my nose and sinuses. On 12/27, the headache continued, and I had severe left eye pain, as well as pain chewing and the swollen nodes, that became painful to touch. On 12/28, I went to my PCP and was tested for covid, which was negative. She diagnosed me with a sinus infection and prescribed amoxicillin. On 12/29, I noticed my scalp had lumps on it that were painful and I had a very itchy spot on my forehead, which became swollen as well to about a quarter size lump. I also had other painful spots on my scalp all over and a continued severe headache and left eye pain. I tried to follow up with my PCP on 12/31, but their office was closed, and the on call nurse referred me to urgent care. More painful, swollen lymph nodes have appeared on my face and neck. I wasn&#39;t able to be seen at urgent care until today (1/1), and was then diagnosed with Shingles. I was told to continue amoxicillin and to start taking Valtrex. I am very itchy, mostly on my face, scalp, and left side of my body.

                                                15 min after the vaccine I was flushed and felt hot , ears felt hot as well.  I had a  macular rash on chest and arms. My throat felt itchy and they immediately gave me benedryl.  I was tahycardic as well. When I got home from the ER that night I had to take more benedryl and then the next morning  I was still itchy and my voice was hoarse so I took more xyzal and famotidine. The rash subsided and I continued taking xyzal twice a day , benedryl and famotidine for a week.  After my vaccine the itching did not subside for about 48 hours and it was very difficult to control. I had to take max doses of antihistamines to control the hoarseness In my voice and itching

My whole left side from my neck to my elbow I would feel tremendous pain.  Days passed and nothing would get better so I spoke with my supervisor and she recommended me to go to the ER where they did some labs (blood work).  About 2 weeks later the pain in my left side subsided but the swelling on my neck and the &#34;bump&#34; never went away, although not painful. I received the second dose on 01/04/2021 and the same pain returned from my neck down to my elbow and the neck is swollen again and in pain. I decided not to go to the ER for the second dose and did not obtain medical help so far.

The patient received COVID Vaccine on 18Dec2020 and ended up on Christmas she went to take a bath that was on 24Dec2020 or 25Dec2020 and noticed that her legs were all swollen and she was not used to that at all having swollen legs. She did work on her feet but she wasn&#39;t working on her feet for that week, so she just didn&#39;t know what was causing the swelling and within the last couple of days in Dec2020 she had a quick heart rate like her pulse, it&#39;s not that high but for she it was high it was like 112, 115 as her resting heart rate, so it&#39;s just been having like heart palpitations kind of, she just wanted to report that and kind of see if other people were getting that as a symptom possibly from vaccine. She had in her past had sort of allergic reaction not to a vaccine but &#39;a bad reaction&#39;. She had swollen legs like edema, so she was just hoping. And then the patient stated that she wasn&#39;t tired at the starting, so she wasn&#39;t tired the same day&#39; (could not be clarified further). No treatment was received for all events. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I notified the provider on watch that was monitoring me during my 15 mins after injection and as the walked me to the room I became more and more dizzy, my throat continued to swell and close, my mask was removed where my face was covered with a rash and hives . The dr. Gave me 50 mg benedryl, and a shot of epinephrine.  After wards 911 was called, my heart rate was eventually brought down with the epinephrine as my symptoms began to be controlled. An inhaler was administered because I was short of breath. 3 hours later I was stabilized. I then was recommended to go to urgent care rather the emergency room since the wait was 13 hours to be monitored at the local hospital MLK. I went to urgent care near my home at Hoag hospital and they monitored me and gave me a steroid injection IM. I was discharged with an epi pen just in case abs to take benedryl every 6 hours . The following morning 1/8/21, at 8 am the swelling of my throat retuned I became light headed abs my tongue became numb. I was taken to fountain valley hospital where an IV was started, 500 mg of iv benedryl, another epinephrine injection was given abs I remained under surveillance for another 6 hours. They stated that a lot of people are coming with reoccurring episodes of anaphylaxis after the phizer injection.

It was very mild and resolved within 1 day.  On 1/4/21, she noticed L axillary lymphadenopathy returned. On 1/5/21, it had spread to her right axillary lymph node.

She still has swelling and tenderness at both axillary lymph nodes today 1/11/21. Severity is moderate in that it is painful, but not debilitating.

Which is still a little swollen but improving; pain at injection site/painfulness at the injection site; shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. A 33-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; lot number: EK9231, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included immunosuppression. Concomitant medication included ongoing vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for immunosuppresion. The patient got a couple of the side effects listed. She developed painfulness at the injection site, and it was red a couple of days. She is wondering if she needs to be worried about getting the second one. It was pretty painful that night. It was pretty painful for the next day. If someone barely brushed up against it, it was very painful. Two days later, her husband noticed her shoulder was very red. And then she realized there was a defined red mark where the injections was. The pain is fine now. She didn&#39;t get a rash or have trouble breathing. She did have a swollen lymph node a couple of days later. Which is still a little swollen but improving. She does take an immunosuppressant. The outcome of the events pain at injection site and shoulder became very red/painfulness at injection site and redness/ was a defined red mark where the injections was recovered, while recovering for the event swollen lymph node a couple of days later was recovering.

                                                about 10 hours after administration, I developed SOB, mild chest pain, hoarseness, and right sided wheezes. I self treated with albuterol (2 puffs) inhaler that I have on hand in case of environmental allergy triggers (I rarely have to use it- last use 3 years ago). The wheezing resolved and chest pain improved but the hoarseness remained. Over the next 2-3 hours I developed headache, malaise, mild dizziness, arthralgia, myalgia, and eventually fevers and chills (by 13 hours after vaccine administration). When fever reached 101 I self treated with naproxen 250mg. I slept for 4 hours and awoke diaphoretic, but the fever had resolved and I felt much better. However, I developed urticaria that started on my flexor surfaces of the elbows, hips, and knees, and spread to my adbomen, thighs, and face, with swelling about my right eye. I self treated with 25mg benadryl and itching and urticaria improved to the point that I was able to sleep. When I awoke the next morning my symptoms had largely resolved with the exception of mild headache, body aches, hoarseness, slight chest tightness, and mild residual swelling of the right eyelid.

After body aches subsided at around 2 AM  1/12/2021  experienced mild allergic reaction of hives and lip swelling. This allergic reaction subsided by morning 1/12 with benadryl.   I have never had any side effects or allergic reaction to a vaccine.   I did experience similar mild allergic reaction with antibiotic bactrim, a sulfa based medication.

Throbbing in temples, eye pressure, pressure on top of head, worsened when I would bend over. Did not take any medication, worried it would impact immune response. Drank a lot of water, slept, did some sled massage, and gentle yoga/stretches. By that evening pain level had dropped down to about a 4. Woke up the next morning with 2-3 level pain, was able to go to work without being distracted by pain. Still felt more pressure behind eyes and top of head when I bent over. Next day all symptoms resolved, except very minor tenderness at injection site only when palpated.

                                                allergic reaction; large red itchy rash on her neck / chest area; trembling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 33-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route of administration (lot number: EL1283) in the arm right on 07Jan2021 09:00; at single doses for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies: latex. Concomitant medications included magnesium oxide (MAG OXIDE) at 200 mg, daily (every day) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) at 10 mg, daily (every day); and toprolol at 25 mg, every day (pending clarification for the drug). The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 17Dec2020 (lot number: EK5730) for COVID-19 immunization. Patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination; and has not been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. Within the 15-minute observation period on 07Jan2021, the patient developed a large red itchy rash on her neck and chest area; she stated she felt fine but was observed trembling. She was transported to ED (emergency department, 5 min transport). She was treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) at 25mg IV X1 (intravenous), and methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL) at 60mg IV X1 and famotidine 20mg IV X 1. Patient diagnosis was allergic reaction on 07Jan2021. Patient improved after treatment and was discharged (after being in Emergency room/department or urgent care) as she was observed from 09:11 until 10:33. Final outcome of the events was all recovered on unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time association, the allergic reaction, rash erythematous and trembling are possibly related to suspect BNT62B2 administration.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the COVID vaccine a couple hours ago on 02Feb202 and was very lightheaded. When the patient was asked to provide her mailing address, she stated she was feeling really weird, the vaccine was really taking a big toll on her brain function, she was super dizzy and feels just weird, like everything is in slow motion. Lightheadedness started probably about 20 minutes after she had the shot, they made her wait for 15 minutes, now she just feels really weird. The patient was healthy, she just got blood tests back and everything said she is healthy. She thought they said to call if she was having a side effect of dizziness or weakness, as they are more serious, but she called her doctor and they said to call Pfizer. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: unknown results on unspecified date.

                                                Patient was being held for monitoring after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.  Within 1-2 minutes, patient developed facial redness and itching.  She then started to feel as if her throat was itchy and started coughing uncontrollably.  Denied lip or tongue swelling.  Was feeling normal prior to receiving the vaccine.  Was not recently seen/assessed for other medical care.  No similar symptoms previously.  Patient was taken to the Emergency Department.   Ptaient did have a few red splotches on her chest, but these did not appear consistent with urticaria per the ED physician&#39;s report.  ED physician felt patient&#39;s symptoms may be secondary to anxiety.  However, given history of anaphylaxis and feeling of throat itching it was felt necessary to treat for possible allergic reaction.  Patient was given epinephrine, Benadryl, famotidine, and Solu-Medrol.  She was then monitored in the ED for 4 hours.  During this time, she developed no new symptoms.  She continued to breathe easily with normal and stable vital signs.  She was discharged with instructions  to buy OTC Benadryl 25mg PO to take every 8 hours for 48 hours.  Prednisone 20mg, 3 tablets orally daily for 5 days weas prescribed.  An EpiPen was also prescribed.  Patient advised not to receive second dose of the vaccine and to follow up with her primary care provider.

A 33-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL9264 and Expiration Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 02Feb2021 at 17:45 at 33-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; with no other vaccines administered within four weeks of the bnt162b2 administration.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to an unspecified date, prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date to 16Feb2021.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: Bell&#39;s palsy on left side of face (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, vision has been off/ vision is blurry (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, numbness and tingly/burning sensation in right leg (medically significant) on 06Feb2021 12:00 with outcome of recovering, brain fog (medically significant) on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which required a physician office visit. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, she began having symptoms on the following Saturday and was seen by her doctor and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. The patient stated she has reported this via VSafe and the Pfizer website. The patient also reported other symptoms that have not been reported as follows: had tingling in both legs, brain fog, and vision has been off. The patient was not sure if it was related to the vaccine or steroids. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The patient had been on a steroid, so she did not know if she should wait to get the second dose. The patient just stopped the steroid on 16Feb2021, and the second dose was scheduled for 23Feb2021.  The patient also said she had other symptoms that she had not reported and she said she had tingling that started in one leg now in both legs, brain fog and her vision was off and she was not sure if that was related to the vaccine or the steroid (later clarified as prednisone). The patient was not taking the steroids at the time of diagnosis. &#34;Correct I mean it started after the vaccine, but I was also on medication (Clarified as Prednisone) so I am not really sure what the difference is at this time.&#34; Treatment in response to event: the patient stated, &#34;No I mean for the tingling in my leg I have been just putting heat and Ice on it but I have not done anything actual big treatment and then for my eyes no, my doctor is not sure what is related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy and what is to medication.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included lab work: unknown result on an unspecified date (patient stated, &#34;Yes, I have many&#34;).  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of facial paralysis, hypoaesthesia, burning sensation, and paraesthesia; which included steroids and anti-viral and anti-nausea medicine. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination.

A 33-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Mar2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: asthma and lactose Intolerance- not allergy though (as reported). Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included: fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), loratadine, bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), and vitamins (as reported), all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 20Feb2021 12:00 (at the age of 33-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient stated that 24 hours after her second dose (14Mar2021 12:00), she felt the worst feeling about to faint, all color drained from her face. She got tunnel vision/hearing and felt a &#34;static&#34; feeling all over her body. Then started throwing up. She took a nap and woke up an hour later with 101.2 (degree) fever (14Mar2021) and fought that, along with migraine, aches, chills, hot sweats (14Mar2021). About 8 hours after initial fever (14Mar2021), it spiked to 102.4 (degree) for two hours. It came down quick. The next day, 15Mar2021, it felt like the back of her skull was fractured. And since then (unspecified date), the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore especially when laying down. She has been sleeping on heating pad for 10 days now, and it got a little better but still super sore (head). The events involved a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was received for the back (mostly left side) of her head gets so tight and sore. There was no treatment for the other events. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequelae. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                I received the vaccine at 10:30 am. About two hours later I noticed a minor headache. By 4pm I had a moderate pounding headache. Around 4:30pm, I noticed minor unilateral scalp, facial and neck numbness on the left side. These symptoms lasted about a week, but slowly improved. Four days after the vaccine I had very tender lymph nodes on the left ear area. Today marks two weeks exactly since I received the vaccine and two days ago I noticed slight increase in numbness on the left cheek again which again, is slowly improving.  However, I also wear Invisalign at sometimes notice that I bite my cheek while asleep. I also wear N95 masks four days of the week which are quite tight on the face.   The injection site (Left deltoid) was moderately sore for the first few days and still two weeks later has minor soreness the comes and goes.

I started to feel flush and my heart rate rapidly increased. I felt it was nothing so i tried to calm myself and watch my heart rate on my watch and it continued to increase. It started at 100 and within a minute was at 130. I finally honked my horn for assistance and my symptoms continued. I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

That night, I developed fevers that persisted for about 24h (spiked about 5 separate times - highest fever was 102). Then, on the third night after the vaccine (about 60 hours post vaccine), I had two separate episodes of night sweats (clothes were drenched, no fever). Later that night I had a bowel movement with bright red blood.  I then went to an urgent care where they drew labs, send a Covid swab, ordered stool studies, and ordered a CT abdomen.

                                                On Tuesday 12/28 I started to have severe leg pain in my right leg.  The next morning the pain was still in the right leg and had moved up through my right side in my joints to my knee, hip then went to the with shoulder down that arm.  My forearm became very painful on 12/30 and started to swell then radiated into my wrist joint and finger joints.  12/31 the pain continued in all those areas and had moved to my left side of my body starting with the left arm following the same course as the right side.  On 1/1 the pain has persisted and I am unable to perform any ADL&#39;s.  I saw an urgent care physician who told me to take ibuprofen.  I have been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol with no relief. Now all my joints are swelling in bilateral hands, wrist.  On 1/2 my bilateral ankle joints and feet started to have similar pain.  Know all my extremities are difficult to use and it is hard to walk due to the pain.  Because of the pain in my hands things feel heavier than what they should.  I am a medical provider and this almost seems like polyarthralgia rheumatica, I am going to go see a physician on Monday

                                                Estimated due date:  04/10/2021 I started to get very flush and warm, dizzy so I had to sit down for a moment (I had to stop the procedure I was doing in order to sit down and drink some water). I kept trying to hydrate and had a headache the rest of the day and it went through the evening and night. I did not take anything and went to bed with the headache and woke up and felt fine.

                                                Anaphylactic reaction 6 days post vaccine 24Dec2020; I had severe chest tightness; SOB; throat soreness; hoarse voice; mouth swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician, the patient.  A 34-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Dec2020 at 15:30 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included severe dust mite allergy (based on skin test).  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included cetirizine hydrochloride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol (NORCO), ibuprofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and ondansetron (ZOFRAN); all for unspecified indications from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination.  On 24Dec2020 at 10:00, 6 days post vaccination, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling; all reported as life threatening.  The events led to an emergency room visit and she was given epinephrine (EPI-PEN), methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) as treatment. The patient stated that she developed the reactions 45 minutes after she took premedications for a dilatation and curettage procedure. The premedications included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron. She stated she had taken these medications several times before and this was the first time she had this reaction. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the anaphylactic reaction, severe chest tightness, shortness of breath, throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling were recovered on unknown dates.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Anaphylactic reactions presented as chest tightness, shortness of breath,  throat soreness, hoarse voice, and mouth swelling, developed 45 minutes after premedications including included ibuprofen, hydrocodone bitartrate/paracetamol, ondansetron for a dilatation and curettage procedure and 6 days post vaccination with BNT162B2, the event therefore is most likely attributed to these premedications unrelated to the vaccine use.

                                                At around 11:45pm tingling started in my left eyebrow. I thought there was something in my eyebrow and after time of wiping it a few times I went to look into the mirror and realized that nothing was there. about and hour later I got a drink and a snack to eat and I realized I had a numb sensation in the left corner of my lip.  As a nurse I went though the signs of a stroke with 2 other nurses I called. Everything was normal other than that sensation. Thinking I was just overly tired I went to bed. When I woke up the next day I felt okay until I went to drink some coffee and the numb sensation in my corner lip was still there. Now I was concerned and called employee health and was instructed to go to the ER to role out a stoke. I followed employee health&#39;s instructions and went to the ER. I was diagnosed with facial paresthesia and discharged with instructions to come back if symptoms got worse.  Symptoms persisted all day and around 7 I called my mom on video chat to show a visual facial twitch on the left side of my face. right after I got off the phone with her the left side of my face drooped and my fiance immediately drove me to the closest ER. I was seen immediately and they decided to admit me. The did labs and head CT. They admitted me to labor and delivery because there were no other rooms. The next day I was seen by a neurologist and many doctors.

                                                I have an infection at the injection site. I believe this could happen with any vaccine but wanted to report just in case. I am experiencing a large circle (a little smaller than a baseball) of swollen red skin that is painful around the injection site. Last night, the lymph nodes in my armpit, neck and collar bone on the right side swelled up and were painful. I feel fatigued.

Normal is 110s/60s-70s. No anxiety feelings.  -0740 throat started to have increased mucous production. Had the tickle and tightness in throat. Asked and received 25mg Benadryl with cup of water. -0742 started clearing throat frequently and slight cough. Knew it was anaphylaxis and told the team I need to go to the ER. Asked for additional 25mg Benadryl. Also took 20mg Famotidine and 2 puffs Albuterol inhaler--this is my prescribed anaphylaxis routine. Had Epipens on standby. -0743 put on O2 saturation monitor and watched O2 drop into 90-92 range. Asked for epipen on standby as I know when I need to start it. Didn&#39;t want to take that when I knew I was about to get it in the ER and knowing self hadn&#39;t progressed that far. Felt chest tightness and shortness of breath. Voice started becoming hoarse. -0800 EMS arrived (delay as team didn&#39;t know if they were supposed to call 911 or a Code--they chose EMS even though in hospital). Then staff at COVID vaccine clinic kept emphasizing need to go in ambulance while EMS and self fought to go through hospital (much quicker route). Finally cleared to go through hospital to ER. To get some air via breathing in had to sit up leaning forward. Voice completely hoarse by this time. -About 0817 arrived to ER bay. At this time, frequently coughing and cough started to sound stridorous. Difficulty getting breaths in. Had chest pain near heart. Greeted by MD, 2 RNS, and technician. -0819 received IM epinephrine. Attached to 5 lead EKG monitoring and O2 monitoring. Blood pressure done again. Higher than previous. -About 0821 had working IV (previous two attempts failed as veins were constricting). Given IV Solumderol. Started bolus of 1L Normal Saline. -Not sure how long after by cough subsided, increased mucous production subsided, as well as hoarseness decreased. -Held for observation for 2hours (would be longer if not resolved). - Discharged around 1015. At this time, hoarseness almost all gone. Minimal throat clearing. Cough resolved.  -Prescribed epipen inhalers (mine expired) and Prednisone. Prednisone is PRN for mild breathing difficulties if it starts again tomorrow 1/13/21.  -At 1400 took 50mg Benadryl and 20mg Famotidine as previously prescribed for anaphylaxis maintenance. Will continue this as previously prescribed every 6hours until symptoms stay resolved. -Made follow up appointment with Primary Care Physician per protocol

Later that morning 6:30am, I developed severe fatigue, dizziness upon standing and walking,  a L sided headache, L sided arm pain extending from elbow to sternocleidomastoid muscles on the L side, and axillary lymphadenopathy in the same arm as the vaccine (left). I took 650mg of Tylenol and went to work. Walking at a normal pace, my heart rate was 145. At rest inside the hospital it was in the 110s (measured by watch). the headache lasted all day on 1/9 and 1/10 and my neck felt slightly stiff (it was difficult to turn my head to look at traffic behind while driving). I took additional doses of Tylenol on 1/9 and 1/10 and by the AM of 1/11, all of my symptoms had resolved except for the L axillary lymphadenopathy.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                I had one day of sweats, body aches, and fatigue in which I stayed in bed the calendar day after I got the second vaccine.  I planned to get the vaccine on a Friday when I was off the following day in case this happened so I could rest, but if I had been scheduled to work I would have taken the day off to rest based on the symptoms. I felt normal the next calendar day. I was 31 weeks pregnant at the time, had no adverse events related to the pregnancy, and am due 3/10/21 with a delivery scheduled 3/3/21; baby and mom are doing just fine.

                                                On Tuesday, 11/19 about 10 pm, I started feeling some discomfort in my left breast.  The next morning, I was fatigued, had a headache, and woke up with an elevated basal body temperature (I&#39;m normally between 96.0 and 97.5 in the mornings, but ran at 98.2. Not a fever, but enough for me to think it was odd), and some discomfort in my left breast.  By the afternoon, part of my breast was red and warm to the touch.  My temperature was still in the normal range at 98.7 (I checked since I work in a hospital and wanted to make sure I reported any illness quickly).  I went to the ambulatory care center and was diagnosed with mastitis of the left breast and prescribed cephalexin 500 mg capsule QID x10.  After 7 doses, I am feeling better and the tenderness, discoloration, and warmth are gone.

                                                The day of my 1st vaccine, about 10 min after I was in the waiting room and I started feeling &#34;weird&#34; in my whole body and lightheaded. I got some juice. Then I started to get hot and was sweating, my whole face and neck were flushed; I also felt mild burning sensation on the R lower lung area. They took me in back and gave me more juice and water and put ice packs on me. It took 30&#43; minutes to feel better. They called a team to come do my vitals and my HR was in the 100s and they said my eyes were dilated. On my way home I had a weird throbbing pain in my L upper chest just above my boob. When I  got home I had chills/felt freezing for a few hours and was fatigued. The next day (Sun) I had moderate joint pain, fatigue, and was very achy; my chest felt tight and I needed my inhaler and some tramadol. On Mon I felt better and went back to work, but then Tues I was achy again and my coworker said I looked pale; I took some tramadol and felt better, just tired. On wed I was having pains in my neck, shoulder, down my arm L arm, and down my scapula- the arm I had the injection. Throughout the day the pain was throbbing and ended up a 7/10 and edema in my neck/shoulder/axillary occurred; I couldnt carry anything heavy and was guarding that arm.  Tramadol didn&#39;t help the pain and I eventually took 600mg  ibuprofen and made a telemedicine visit w/ my MD for the next day. After 3 days the pain was subsiding but the edema took ~ 1 week- it subsided the weekend before my next vaccine.  The day of my 2nd dose I did ok after the vaccine at 4pm. While they were injecting it I felt burning down my arm. I felt lightheaded and &#34;weird&#34; afterwards and warm, but no eye dilation or flushing. 3 hours after the vaccine at 7pm I felt tired and a little achy and slept from 7-9pm. At 9pm I woke up very achy, I had 1 itchy hive that popped up on my R inner forearm.  The next day I had joint pain in every joint and very achy and fatigued. The joint pain subsided on day 2 after the vaccine but I was very achy and fatigued for a good 72 hrs. Vaccine was wed and saturday the pain in my neck returned and the edema came back and was a little worse than before, and the area where the edema was, was painful to touch. It started subsiding ~ a week after the vaccine, but a little bit is still currently here- but no pain to touch. My allergist has been following up w/ me this whole time.

At 12:30: I went to the ER for tingling on my face and right arm, I thought I was having a stroke. In between home and traveling to the ER, paralysis started on my right side of face

A 34-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine; lot number: EL3284), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 11Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing anxiety since she was 13 years old. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the vaccine on Monday at 12 o&#39;clock. She got it for work. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She developed the side effect Tuesday at 2 am. The left side of her face started tingling and had numbness, which is the same side she received the vaccine on. She doesn&#39;t have weakness. It is not resolving. It is from her lower eyelid to her bottom jaw bone. When asked if it was improving persisting or worsening, she said it depends. Sometimes it gets worse and affects her lips, and sometimes it is on and off. It won&#39;t be completely gone. It switched between her cheek and jaw and then her nose and mouth sometimes. If she bends over, it tingles worse. It is just very annoying. It felt like if she had Novocain on the top and bottom of her mouth. It is irritating. She got it because she doesn&#39;t want COVID and she works as a nurse. She does have really bad anxiety. She has nothing else medical. She is just really nervous. It is not going away. She is freaking out. She would like more information. The outcome of the event &#34;It is just very annoying/It is irritating&#34; was unknown, while for the other events was not recovered.

The next day I woke up with an intermittent headache, little bit fatigue, very very tired, my arm was super heavy and I was in bed all day. The third day I felt dizzy at times, tired, my eyes itched a lot and my body.  I didn&#39;t take any medication at any time.

Developed low grade temp, flushed face, fatigue, muscle stiffness, body aches hours following vaccine. Aches and fatigue continues and it?s now day 8. The fatigue is constant but comes in waves. I?m taking unexpected naps which are abnormal for me. Caffeine and methylphenidate are ineffective. I?m still sore. I also have brain fog, maybe from the fatigue. I can?t think straight and it takes me longer to process and do tasks. I woke up 2 hours ago and I can?t wait to sleep again.

As the day progressed, I began to have pain in my joints and muscles. I felt very tired all day as well. I also experienced skin sensitivity which basically just made my skin hurt if anything/one touched me. Sunday my headache persisted, still had pain at injection site and felt warm to the touch. Swollen lymph nodes also still there and fatigue. Monday morning symptoms of headache, injection site pain and warmth and swollen lymph nodes still felt.  Taking Tylenol to help with headache, warm compresses to help swollen lymph nodes and ice pack for injection site pain.

                                                I am an APRN, and received the vaccine not quite one week ago. I waited 15 minutes within the facility and then left. Sat in my car working for about 8-10 minutes when a sudden rush of heat ran through my body.  I felt lightheaded, my tongue was prickly, and I felt like I was going to pass out.  I was able to get back into the facility to let them know of the sudden symptoms.  At that time I felt like my heart was racing and was diaphoretic. They continued to watch me for another 15-20 minutes, they did have an epi pen but it was not given. I was feeling slightly better and then left again.  I waited in my car approximately 20 minutes before deciding it would be safe to drive away.  After driving for about 10 minutes I had another rush of heat, lightheadedness, and then I started having shortness of breath.  At this time it would have been about 1 hour, maybe longer, since receiving the vaccine.  I was not close to an emergency medical facility at that time, and did not feel like my throat was swelling so thought it would be best to try to drive to the nearest ER.  I knew I had an epi pen from my work that I could use if needed.  I contacted another nurse practitioner who I work with who stayed on the phone with me until I was able to get to a safe place.  At that time the symptoms had improved, not resolved.  It had been able 20 minutes during this episode.  In all, I continued to feel jittery for about 3-4 more hours.  Since my symptoms did improve I did not go to the ER.  I contacted my health department, Louisville health dept, the following day and reported symptoms to the medical director.

Starting Tuesday morning, for three days, I got calf/feet cramps that were non-stop. I did call my doctor and got lab work done on 12-31. This lab work showed some kidney values that were off. Starting Sunday my legs and feet swelled up. I had a routine MS appointment on Monday and they stated since there is no data for folks with MS and the vaccine that they cannot rule out the vaccine is playing a role in some of this along with the IVIG.  I did follow up with my primary care doctor on Tuesday and they re did lab work as well as did a ultrasound to rule out blood clots. She did state she felt like it was the perfect storm between the COVID vaccine and then the Immunoglobins that I am on.  She suggested I download the app for CDC and report those items as well.  The doctors are still suggesting I get the 2nd shot just have to do some things prior to the second shot.

She did not immediately report these symptoms but returned to the site of her injection (research study site) and reported the cheek swelling and facial flushing to our study nurse.  She denied  lip/tongue/airway swelling, difficulty breathing, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, fever, headache, paresthesias, rapid heart rate, chest pain, or other symptoms at that time.  I am a sub-I for Pfizer\BioNTech vaccine study and authorized an immediate dose of Benadryl 50 mg orally which she received.  I examined her at 12:40 pm and she had a reassuring physical exam as follows:  Constitutional:      Appearance: Normal appearance; well-hydrated and alert; no retractions, tachypnea, nasal flaring, or audible wheezing/breath sounds.  No pallor. HEENT:     Head: Normocephalic and atraumatic.     Nose: Nose normal without visible discharge.    Mouth: Mucous membranes are moist.     Cheeks:  Minimal edema of both cheeks is present; no visible erythema on exam. Eyes:     Conjunctiva/sclera: Conjunctivae normal.     Pupils: Pupils are equally round and symmetric. Cardiovascular:     Rate and Rhythm: Normal rate and regular rhythm, HR 80-90.    Pulses: Normal pulses in left wrist 2&#43;/2&#43;; warm hands. Pulmonary:     Effort: Pulmonary effort is normal; RR 12-14.    Breath sounds: Normal breath sounds.  Abdominal:     General: Abdomen is flat.  Neurological:     Mental Status: She is alert; speech and comprehension are normal. The patient still felt unusual by 2:00 pm and was referred to our Emergency Room for further evaluation.  In our ER, she had the following vital signs and exam findings: BP 140/87  | Pulse 73  | Temp 98.1 °F (36.7 °C)  | Resp 16  | SpO2 100%  Gen: well appearing, no apparent distress, speaking in full sentences, no dysphonia Head: normocephalic, atraumatic, no hematoma Eyes: pupils equal reactive to light, extraocular movements intact ENT: hearing grossly normal, oral mucosa moist without edema/angioedema Resp: speaking in full sentences, clear to auscultation bilaterally, no rubs/crackles/wheeze, normal effort Abd: normoactive bowel sounds, nontender nondistended, no rebound/guarding, no organomegaly, faint/resolving urticaria abd x2 Ext: no deformities, no joint swelling, no edema, faint patchy erythema bilateral upper arms Neuro: alert, nonfocal Psych: AAOX3, normal affect/mood   I walked to our emergency room and reexamined her, and the only new finding were some pink small nonraised popular lesions on her abdomen and proximal arms, but she had no urticaria.  Her lungs remained CTA and she was otherwise as before.  The emergency room only gave famotidine 20 mg to her and discharged her with an EpiPen to use at home (they specifically felt she did not need it in the ER), but gave her oral cetirizine 10 mg to take daily for the next few days.  I asked her how she felt upon discharge from the ER and she felt fine/normal.

A 35-year-old female patient received her 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at single dose via an unknown route on the right side on 21Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included intermittent hives. Concomitant drug included ongoing cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) 5 mg for intermittent hives. The reporting nurse practitioner saw a patient on 31Dec2020 who was vaccinated on 21Dec2020 and had a Bell&#39;s Palsy reaction (reported as not serious). She did some research and saw no more incidents in the general population but she wanted to report this. She also wanted to get more information on if the patient should proceed with dose number 2 of the vaccine. The patient developed the Bell&#39;s Palsy within 5 minutes after getting the vaccine. She thought it was because she was anxious to get the vaccine, so she brushed it off. The Bell&#39;s Palsy was still occurring but per the patient it had improved. On exam she did not have any weakness, facial droop or dumbness with sharp or dull testing. The patient perceived it along the face still and the arm. The reporting nurse practitioner said that the arm was probably not Bell&#39;s Palsy, but more related to getting the vaccine in the arm and it hits a nerve. Patient stated that her smile was also unequal and it was difficult for her to close her right eye, although now (as of 31Dec2020) she can. Her right eye was irritated a little dry. Regarding treatment, the patient was started on steroids on 31Dec2020. She did not start her on an anti-viral as she did not want it to impact her immunity to the vaccine. The patient also complained of right sided ear pain. She was unsure if that was related to the Bell&#39;s Palsy, but it was also on the right side. There was fluid in the ear but no infection. The pain was still ongoing.  The patient also mentioned numbness in a small area of her tongue when she first got the vaccine. This was still ongoing. Outcome of Bell&#39;s Palsy was resolving. Outcome of the event numbness in a small area of her tongue, right sided ear pain was not resolved. Outcome of the other events was unknown.     The reporting nurse practitioner stated that this was not serious as this was a mild case and was thankfully resolving. The reporting nurse practitioner comment that nothing of history was relevant besides for the last several months (as of 31Dec2020) the patient had been taking 5mg of cetirizine hydrochloride for intermittent hives. She wondered if she had not been taking it how she would have reacted or if the reaction would have been more severe.    Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of Bell&#39;s Palsy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.

I pulled over, felt a bit dazed and was unable to use my left hand purposefully to call 911 on my cell phone, but was able to call 911 on my Watch using my right (dominant) hand. While talking to the dispatcher, my symptoms resolved (total duration a few minutes)  so I requested that they not send an ambulance but instead felt well enough to drive to my hospital ED. I discussed my case with the triage RN and ED attending who felt my symptoms were related to the vaccine, with no further work up needed, given then my symptoms resolved. My vitals were stable in triage.  No chest pain or shortness of breath, with normal neurological function and sensation of my left arm.  Note: I was not officially checked in or seen as a patient.     Sudden onset weakness and spasms of left arm (side of vaccine administration) about 40 minutes after vaccine

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

Chills, Severe Headache,  All over body, joint, and skin pain. Then developed Fever around 102. Saturday headache was mild, very fatigued, skin felt sunburnt/pain, no fever, was still achy. Temp highest was 99.4 that evening. Noticed palpable clavicular lymph nodes that were very tender. Then noted an axillary one that was about marble sized and tender as well. Sunday about the same- was able to get up and do housework but felt fatigued easily. No temp. Sunday evening developed tenderness in neck area and possible lymph node swelling and decreased ROM.  Also at times if I change positions I have a very brief  moderate headache. I did wake up in the middle of the night drench with sweat which is very abnormal for me.  Neck is the biggest complaint as of now. I called my PCP and they said to call employee health.

My fever went down around 6am, but I was still experiencing severe body aches. The overall affect was similar to the flu. I took some over the counter medications to treat the fever and body aches (Advil and Tylenol) and began feeling better around noon.

A 35-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) ( (lot number was unknown) intramuscularly on 17Dec2020 at 0.3ml, and the second single dose (lot number EJ1685) intramuscularly on 04Jan2021 07:45 at 0.3ml, for COVID-19 prophylaxis.  Medical history included ongoing diabetes. Her diabetes was diagnosed about 6 months ago (reported on 06Jan2021) and was well controlled. Her glucose was at 140 at the ER (emergency room) even after drinking a drink that had sugar in it. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient received the second dose on 04Jan2021 at 07:45 and experienced a severe reaction hours after she received it, and she ended up having to go the ER and that they were baffled about what happened.   She reported her symptoms were: fatigue, joint pain mainly in her knees, bone pain that did not feel like muscle pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes in the left axilla, and swelling, redness, pain, and soreness in the left arm at the injection site and also said that the injection site itched a little bit.   Her symptoms started about 9-10 at night on 04Jan2021. She said that she felt like with the second dose she noticed the soreness and pain and redness at injection site after about 2 hours after receiving the second dose, which was sooner than with the first injection. The fever started with the chills and body aches. The chills and body aches started at 22:00 on 04Jan2021. She took acetaminophen and melatonin to try and sleep it off. Fever was after that at around midnight 04Jan2021 and she was burning in fever and her temperature was 104. She stated she started taking layers off and got out from under her covers. She had a sweater on when she took her temperature and her axillary temperature was 105. She said that she got into a hot shower because that was the only thing that provided comfort to her chills. She had not had any chills in about the last 12 hours though (as reported on 06Jan2021). She said that the body aches were so severe that she just sat in her bed and cried. She had tachycardia and she was grunting in pain. She was rotating ibuprofen and acetaminophen and then her fever was not as high. She stated that if her fever came back it was lower each time, and if she did not take the medications though, the bone pain was excruciating. She said that with the bone pain it was like no-one can hold her hand or hug her. Fatigue started at around midnight 04Jan2021. Her headache was at midnight. She felt like she had a headband on and was radiating down the back of her neck. She noticed the lymph nodes were swollen after she went to the ER at around 07:00-08:00 05Jan2021. She was walking with pillow under her arm, and if she moved or lifted her arm it hurt.  She went to the ER at 01:00 05Jan2021. Her blood pressure was 90/50, her heart rate was 144-152 at rest, temperature was 102.8, O2 saturation was 95-96. She said that it was painful to breath and she was grunting, but did not have any breathing issues. The nurse thought she was septic and notified the doctor. The nurse and the doctor did not think it was the vaccine and thought that she was COVID-19 positive. But after they tested her, she was negative for flu and COVID and they were baffled. They were unclear on what happened and did not think it was from the vaccine. They bolused her 1 liter of Normal Saline and gave her a dose of Fentanyl that minimally helped with the bone pain. She was also given 30mg of ketorolac (TORADOL) IV (intravenous) and that significantly improved her pain. She was there a total of 3 hours. She was admitted to the back area of the ER. She said that they drew labs and everything was within normal limits. Her CRP (C-reactive protein) was 30 and her lactate was at 1.5. She said that they told her that  she was most likely having an immune response to the vaccine. Her heart rate and blood pressure came to a more normal range and everything returned to baseline. Her heart rate was 109. She was told to rotate paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen for at least the next 24 hours and hydrate.  The events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were serious due to hospitalization from 05Jan2021 to 05Jan2021. The patient was recovering from fever, chills, joint pain, headache, heart rate and blood pressure, not recovered from fatigue, bone pain, swollen lymph nodes and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site. The event swollen lymph nodes worsened. The outcome of &#34;injection site itched a little bit&#34; was unknown.   The reporter considered the events fever, chills, fatigue, joint pain, bone pain, headache, swollen lymph nodes, and swelling, pain, redness and soreness at the injection site were all related to the vaccine; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, chills, fatigue, pain, arthralgia, bone pain, headache, lymphadenopathy, vaccination site erythema, vaccination site swelling, vaccination site pain, blood pressure decreased, tachycardia, grunting and vaccination site pruritus cannot be excluded.

                                                swollen lymph node, right side of neck; caused pain when swallowing; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professoonal (patient). A 35-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Dec2020 11:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic asthma and allergy to animal dander, mold, pollen. The patient was not pregnant. Concomitant medications included fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING), salbutamol sulfate (PROAIR), and OTC vitamins. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took erythromycin and experienced drug allergy to erythromycin. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. 1 day after vaccination, on 30Dec2020 08:00, the patient woke up with swollen lymph node, right side of neck. Between 30Dec2020 and 04Jan2021, it increased in size and caused pain when swallowing. On 04Jan2021, the patient sought care at local emergency room (ER) due to concerns that it may be blocking esophagus. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included computerised tomogram (CT scan) with unknown results on 04Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events and included treatment with intravenous antibiotic. Outcome of the events was not recovered. The events were considered non-serious by the reporter.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

I went home and was tachycardic 120-130bpm that continued throughout the night to the point I couldn&#39;t sleep my heart was pounding so hard and fast. I was extremely thirsty and dehydrated all night.  I continued to have tachycardia for several days despite hydrating. My thighs also continued to feel week for several weeks. I developed a 100.7 F temperature and had flu like symptoms the following days.

                                                The patient had received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine (lot number EL 1283, exp 4/30/2021) and about an hour later, she began to experience chest tightness and throat tightness.  She took her albuterol inhaler, but did not feel better, and proceeded to go to the ER. She has a history of asthma, but regards it as mild and only takes albuterol as needed.  She denies having any cutaneous, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular symptoms.  At the ER, she was administered diphenhydramine and corticosteroids--she began to subjectively feel better.  She denied a history of allergic reactions to medications or vaccines, and denied a history of anaphylaxis.  She was not taking any medications on the day of her reaction, and was at her baseline health.  She had no vaccines within the past 14 days.

                                                12 hours post vaccine developed severe muscle and bone pain and a fever, took 1000 mg of Tylenol 17 hours post vaccine and the fever broke, but the pain persisted. Took Ibuprofen 20 hours post vaccine because I developed a severe headache in addition to nausea. Headache became less intense, but all other symptoms remained at the same intensity. I fell asleep and woke up with a 103F at 28 hours. Pain persisted as well. I went back to sleep and woke up at 7pm when the fever broke, I noticed all the other symptoms were gone except for some new neck pain. The neck pain could be related to how I slept though since it was new. I did not take any more medication and went back to bed later in the evening. I woke up at 4am, roughly 29 hours post vaccine, with a fever and didn&#39;t take my temperature, but did take 1000 mg Tylenol. It broke an hour later. I have had waves of symptoms of a low grade fever all day (slight chills), which then feels like it breaks on its own indicated by sweat and chills disappearing. I haven&#39;t had to medicate any further however and in comparison to yesterday I feel amazing!

                                                Headache developed before 7pm. Chills soon after for the remainder of the night. Woke up the next morning feeling like hit by a bus with so many muscle aches. Also was warm/hot most of the day. Didn&#39;t feel good in general. Headache came and went most of the day. The next morning still felt &#39;off&#39;, but not horrible like the previous day.

She has numbness and loss of sensation in whole left side of body, limp and sluggish.  Went to ER 01/18/20 and they thought was overload of immune system.  They suggested her to report.  Symptoms did not subside until 01/22/21, gradually the feeling came back, with rest.  She was off work the last week to rest up.

                                                Within an hour was feeling jumpy, easily startled, foggy thinking, fever (highest 101.6 normal temp is 97.5), unable to sleep for over 2 days (still haven?t slept partly due to extreme pain), extreme pain all over body especially on left side, racing heart (103 while laying down normal resting is 78), fever would not go down with any amount of fever reducer for 2 days (starting to slowly go down), sore throat, swelling in ankles and feet for two days (is going down now), congested nose, severe ear pain, joint stiffness and extreme ache.  Itchy all over body and rash on back. I received the vaccine on 1/20 it is now 1/22 and most are still present though some are getting better very slowly. I did not seek medical care as no one would see me so I just have isolated myself and checked in with a good friend regularly. I just felt it important to report this as no one warns how bad the reaction may be and unlike with the first dose, absolutely no check ins from hospital. I find that to be completely unacceptable.

Aching has been ongoing and intermittent.  1/17/21 Developed left ear &#34;fullness&#34;.  On 1/20/21 went to GYN for exam, explained left underarm pain, told that my breast exam appeared normal, but she questioned if my left ear fullness and left under arm pain were related.  1/21/21 Left Ear &#34;fullness&#34; began to radiated causing left temporal pressure, spreading across forehead.  Pressure developed behind both eyes.  Sudden onset of dizziness occurred.  Went to urgent care where they said I had swollen lymph nodes and believed I was having a auto immune response to something.  Told I received the vaccine on 1/7/21, they said the symptoms could be related to the vaccine.  1/22/21 Notice I would occasionally feel like I had a &#34;lump or pressure&#34; to the side of my throat.   As of present I am continuing to have Left  Ear &#34;fullness&#34;, left underarm aching, and bilateral eye pressure has bee intermittent yet ongoing.

A 35-year-old female patient received second single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021) intramuscularly on 12Jan2021 (between 8:30 to 9 am) at left deltoid for Covid-19 prevention. The first dose was received on Wednesday (unspecified date). Patient had no medical history and had no concomitant medications. At night of 12Jan2021, the patient had a fever of 102, but she went to bed with it and she woke up in the morning around 4:30 or 5 am (13Jan2021) in a pool of sweat, so she took her temperature and she was fever with 103.6. Patient took Motrin (Store Brand, lot number as either: 0GE2417A or OGE2417A, expiry: Apr2022) three 200 mg tablets, for a totally of 600 mg for the fever and had a cold shower, and the temperature came down to 103. Then after like 10-15 minutes of her laying on the couch with ice packs on her arms and stuff, it went down to 102.6. Patient was not going to go to the ER for just the fever, but then she started having heart palpitations, and she took her blood pressure and it was 170/113 and her heart rate was 176. Patient went to the hospital, and when they took her heart rate, it was 156. She had her blood taken at the hospital and everything was normal, except that her Potassium was a little low, it was 3. The ER did an EKG that showed Sinus Tachycardia and she was given IV Fluids (two boluses of 0.9% Normal Saline, 2000 mL total via IV, a bag of Potassium IV, two oral tablets of Potassium, unspecified total dose), and everything went back down. She had to call out from work that day and planed to follow up with her Primary Care Physician (PCP) in a couple of days. Patient was no longer had the fever, high blood pressure or high heart rate, as when she left the ER this morning, her temperature was 98, blood pressure was 111/82, and her heart rate was 96. She felt good now, but she did not know if it could happen again. Patient thought that it was maybe just her immune response to the vaccine, so she would say that she has recovered probably close to completely. Patient also had a headache and ringing in her ears, and those had resolved by now as well. The events Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure resolved on 13Jan2021 and other event resolved in Jan2021. The patient stated that the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) could have been serious with her blood pressure being so high, but it was not so serious because she did the right thing and went to the ER for treatment and got fluids. She believes the events (Fever, Sinus tachycardia, Heart Palpitations, high blood pressure) are medically significant. The patient believes that the events she experienced were directly caused by her receiving the vaccine, as she has never had these symptoms before other than she of course has had fevers in her life in the past.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 10 minutes I was numb with a hot, tingly sensation from my left knee up to my neck and my left wrist up my arm to my neck. Then I felt like I had been hit in the head with a bat, but the pain migrated from side to side in my head. It was a very strange feeling. The hot, tingly numbness lasted about 45 minutes to an hour, the headache began to subside after 2 hours. The next day I had a little raised redness and the injection site and a bad headache, but was otherwise fine. At the vaccination site they strongly advised I go to the ER, which I did. I have no history of vaccine reaction.

I felt joint pain in my body but mostly my finger joints and wrist.  Left hand strength had become weak and couldn&#39;t put any weight in it or grip. After 12 hrs the swollen feeling went away.  The next day I noticed my index finger on left hand was very swollen but my hand didn&#39;t feel swollen like the day before.  2 days later I noticed my middle finger on the left hand was swollen. After 12 hours, the swelling is gone.  The next week I notice my middle finger on the right hand was swollen.  My hands are unable to make a fist when swollen feeling.  Now both of my hands are swollen.  A hot shower helps and sometime Motrin.

At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

Flushing of hands; Dizziness; Fatigue; Legs became heavy; Joint stiffness of hands; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine; Lot number: EJ 1685), intramuscular on the left arm on 23Dec2020 at 06:30 AM in a hospital at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included known allergies of seasonal allergies, cats, and metals; migraines, chronic idiopathic urticaria, and angioedema. The patient was not pregnant and did not have any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination and did not test positive to COVID post vaccination (also reported as not been tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination). Concomitant medication included propranolol, cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), and sertraline (reported as other medications in two weeks). On 23Dec2020 at 06:45 AM, the patient experienced immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands; flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands. She was monitored by colleagues for an hour, prescription for Epi pen refilled, and available angioedema and fatigue persisted for three days. It was reported that the patient was not treated for the adverse events but it was also reported that the AE treatment also included X-ray and antibiotic. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of immediate symptoms of angioedema of lips, throat, eyes, hands, flushing of hands, dizziness, fatigue, legs became heavy, and joint stiffness of hands cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate

I was taken to a separate area and felt warm and flush in my chest. They laid me down on the cot and said I looked pale. My hands were cold and within minutes I was shaking uncontrollably. I think it was an anxiety related to my research I&#39;ve done at my job related to COVID. I don&#39;t think it was an allergic reaction, but I do have an appt on Thursday. I was monitored for about an hour. Symptoms went away but I wasn&#39;t totally ok until the next day besides soreness in next arm.

The patient described her condition as, &#34;my throat feels like it is closing up.&#34;  An epipen was given at 3:12 pm and the patient reported improvements at 3:16 pm (four minutes after the epipen was given).  Emergency services was called and reported to the scene at 3:12 pm where they noted the patients improved condition, after the epipen was administered.

                                                - Almost immediate onset of nausea, sore throat, headache, and sensation of fast heart rate; along with feelings of mild illness (like a cold) and arm pain which is consistent with other vaccination response.   - Waited at clinic for 30 minutes as directed due to previous history of anaphylaxis to injected meds (among others). Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

A 36-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730) dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 11:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included von willebrand&#39;s disease, narcolepsy with cataplexy, IIH (Idiopathic intracranial hypertension), HTN (hypertension), GERD (gastrooesophageal reflux disease), migraines. Patient also had known allergies: PCN (penicillin), shellfish, IV contrast, cefdinir and bees. On 23Dec2020, patient got nerve blocks for her migraines. Throughout the day patient was cough and her face started flushing so she tooled diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). Around 22:30, patient felt like her throat was closing and she was choking. She had chest pain, chest tightness. EMS (emergency medical services) was called and patient was brought to the hospital. On 25Dec2020, patient felt like her throat was closing, like someone was sitting on her chest and chest tightness still with chest pain. Very SOB (shortness of breath) at rest. Patient went to the ER (emergency room) and received IV dexamethasone (DECADRON) and diphenhydramine hydrochloride. On 26Dec2020, patient had the same symptoms but with severe facial flushing and patient went back to the ER and was given IV dexamethasone. Patient was sent home on a maximum amount of medications. I had seen her primary care, ENT (ear nose throat centre), Allergy, ID (infectious disease), and pulmonology. Her CT (computerised tomogram) of chest on 25Dec2020 was negative along with her COVID test. Patient SOB on rest and exertion still. Onset date of the adverse events was reported as 23Dec2020, 22:30. Patient received treatment for the events included multiple medications and high dose prednisone. Lab data on 25Dec2020 included CT of chest: negative, influenza type A/B combo: negative, Covid 19: negative and nasal swab: negative. Action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable. Outcome of the events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal relationship.  The clinical presentation of the events is suggestive of possible allergic reactions. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

                                                Symptoms started approximately 16 hours after receiving the vaccine. Body aches all over including breast, under arms, legs, feet stomach.  Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

Later I got really weak and shaky, fatigued, that night I woke up with night sweats, and chills, woke up completely drenched, I had to change the sheets and pajamas. 5 days after the vaccine I was really exhausted, the fatigue was awful. There was also an itching sensation but no hives.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (COVID 19, brand: Pfizer) lot no: EJ1685, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 23Dec2020 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient had no relevant medical history and no known allergies. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination, last menstrual date was on 05Oct2020, delivery date will be on 12Jun2021, gestation period: 11.  Concomitant medication includes daily multivitamin. The patient did not receive other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 30Dec2020 04:00 am, 7 days after vaccine (as reported), a large mass appeared in right axilla. The mass was painful to touch. Overnight mass more than doubled in size on 31Dec2020 the mass took up her entire arm pit, went to immediate care and was given antibiotics. The mass decreased in size but has not gone away. She followed up with primary care. She had bloodwork and ultrasound of axilla and right breast. Blood work was normal. Ultrasound showed a few enlarged and abnormal lymph nodes believed to be reactive in nature. Largest lymph node as of 08Dec2020 2.5 x 0.9 x 2.2 cm. The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had these symptoms through 0800am on 1/13.  I was recovered from these symptoms on 1/14.  However, by the evening of 1/15 I developed some sinus-related symptoms like sneezing and runny nose. On 1/16 I could not taste or smell anything. I got a PCR COVID test on 1/17 and have not developed any additional symptoms. My sinus related symptoms resolved after 1/17. As of today, 1/22, my PCR results have come back positive.

This worsened over the course of 15 minutes which began to increase the labor of breathing.  Fortunately, I had a left over albuterol inhaler (pro air respiclick) from a respiratory illness a few years ago.  Administered 2 metered doses with near immediate resolution.  No further symptom recurrence.

Later in the evening I had the same feeling in my left leg and in my cheeks, lips, tongue and teeth. I felt like I had been numbed at the dentist, but was coming out of the numbness. It was like when the numbness is mostly gone and you&#39;re left with that tingling sensation, and your face feels puffy. It was basically that feeling in my face, left leg, and left arm. Those sensations are mostly gone today (the second day following), but not quite.

A 36-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 11Jan2021 15:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypothyroidism, asthma, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, chronic allergies, gastritis, and walnut allergy. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), metformin, loratadine (CLARITINE), spironolactone, and calcium carbonate, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D 2000). The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported), intramuscular in the right arm on 21Dec2020 15:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient verbalized, &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s related but I figured I should report just in case. I have had severe lymph node swelling on the right side where I got the vaccine. 24hrs post 2nd vaccination I have had a sudden onset of an extremely violent cough. By sudden onset, I mean I had no desire to cough and over about 30 min I developed the severe need to cough. My sputum is greenish/yellow brown with blood flecks. I&#39;ve never experienced such a violent cough with so much sudden sputum production. I am using an Albuterol inhalor to help chest tightness.&#34; Clinical outcome of chest discomfort was unknown while for the other events was not recovered.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a close chronological association, a causal relationship between reported events and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021, lot# EJ1685), intramuscularly in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID Prevention.  Medical history included ongoing Hypertension/high blood pressure (Diagnosed about 2 years ago).  Concomitant medication included ongoing ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) and just some other vitamins but she does not think that is relevant. She had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine.  The patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy, weakness/felt very weak, hard for her to talk/was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking, thought that she would pass out, all on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 31Dec2020, tired and sore on 02Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 04Jan2021. The patient got the vaccine on 31Dec2020, and is scheduled to receive the 2nd dose next week and within a couple minutes after getting the vaccine, like less than 5 minutes later, she felt dizzy and very weak, and thought that she would pass out, and she was having a hard time talking, like she had to put effort into talking. After like an hour, she felt better. From then on, she had no side effects besides just being tired and sore, but she had no fever or anything like that. She does have hypertension in her history, but she hasn&#39;t been taking her pill because her BP has been stable. She felt like when she took the Pfizer Vaccine, some people can feel their BP shooting up, like it felt like a sensation in the back of head that her BP went up, but she did not think it was her BP because she has not needed to take her pill because her BP has been good. She did not take her BP, so she doesn&#39;t know what her BP was at the time. It was a pressure in the back of her like how she feels if her blood pressure is elevated. Investigation Assessment: No. Relatedness of drug to all the events was related per source of assessment: primary source reporter, method of assessment: global introspection.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the event depressed level of consciousness is possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

This started 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. About 1 1/2 hours symptoms still persisted so took 50mg of Benadryl and slept for 2 hours. Upon waking up facial flushing, dizziness, and pounding heart rate still present but was better. Continued to have left sided cluster headache and face flushing for 48 hours. Also was sore in my left arm down my left side to the bottom of my rib cage all the way up my left neck and sore into my left chest.

                                                Started with some nausea around noon on 1/18 that resolved, then experienced nausea without emesis and palpitations while driving to work at 1800. She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name).

A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE BIONTECH, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 03Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient had headaches in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were none. The patient got vaccine on the 03Jan2021 and her arm was sore, but she felt like this was normal, just like it would feel after a flu shot. Throughout the next week, she was extremely stressed for work. By Friday, which would have been 6 days later. She was feeling really off wellness wise. She was very fatigued, and extremely dizzy on 07Jan2021. On Saturday night 09Jan2021, she felt very bad. She had a sore throat, she was coughing, her chest was burning and hurting. She had severe chills and aches. She thought maybe she needed more sleep because she works out 6 days a week. She felt like she was in over drive like she was killing herself. Sunday morning 10Jan2021, she felt bad. She has so much adrenaline. She was always on the go. She decided to take a nap before the gym Sunday, and she woke up with a huge migraine. She had headaches in the past, but never a migraine. Her head was hurting so bad it woke her up. It hurt all over. She also felt like she had taken a hammer to her joints and bones. Her joints and bones were hurting. She has never felt that before. Her muscles were so achy. Her skin even hurt to touch. She was sensitive all over. She had severe chills. The soreness where they gave the vaccine on her arm all the sudden came back very suddenly. It came back the same day as the other symptoms started. They mostly started on the 09Jan2021, and then on the 10Jan2021 they were worse while migraine and bone hurting were occurred on 10Jan2021. She assumed there were subtle symptoms leading up to the 09Jan2021, but she just didn&#39;t realize it. That was a Saturday and Sunday. The lady that gave it was not gentle. She screamed. The side effects lasted at least 5 days after the 10Jan2021. On the 10Jan2021, she did not feel well so she got tested for COVID because her boss told her to. They tested her Flu, COVID, and strep. She only tested positive for COVID on 10Jan2021. She felt like she wouldn&#39;t be able to drive. She couldn&#39;t walk for 4 days. She felt most of the symptoms had gone away around 5 days after the 10th except fatigue, feeling dizzy, and headaches here and there. She also had a little coughing here and there. That started 09Jan2021 and was ongoing but improved. She got the vaccine because the doctor at her practice really encouraged her to get it done. She also thought if she ever wanted to travel that she might need it. She thought in the long run she might benefit from having the vaccine. She felt peer pressured honestly to get it because she was sketched out to get it at all. She wants to know the rate of people testing positive for COVID after getting the vaccine. The outcome of the events sore arm, chest burning, joint and bone pain, skin even hurt to touch and sensitive was recovered on 15Jan2021, the outcome of the events screamed and couldn&#39;t walk was unknown and the outcome of the other events was recovering.

I went up to the nurse in the monitoring room and showed her the rash. She asked if I was having trouble breathing. At the time I was not. She said I could take Benadryl for the rash as long as I had no allergy to Benadryl. I started driving home. During my drive my throat started to feel itchy and irritated. It proceeded to get worse and when I looked at my throat in the mirror it was very red and starting to be visibly swollen. I drove to the nearest hospital and checked myself in to the emergency room.

It was non painful at first, but now it is tender. It is roughly the size of an egg/golf ball. I also have tenderness on my chest  above my right breast but on the pectoralis muscle. Nothing in the right armpit. I also had aggressive itching at the injection site and a hard area and red welt.

Very weak - if that was a 10th of what COVID felt like, I didn&#39;t want it! Those symptoms lasted about three to five days. By the5th day - I was mostly back to myself. I took Motrin - which helped slightly for headache.

This has been occurring since after receiving the first vaccine, with increased severity after the second.  The symptoms last from 20-2 hours after exposure and then resolve.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting the shot I suddenly felt like I was having an anxiety attack.  My heart was racing and a tingling adrenaline feeling started in my head and spread down through my body.  My throat felt strange, but I could still breathe.  It started to subside after a couple of minutes but didn?t resolve completely for another hour or so.  I also had a headache almost immediately.  In the days following the vaccine I had such sore muscles it was hard to get out of chair or go upstairs.  That lasted 3 days.   About one week after the shot I started noticing my brain felt glitchy.  At night I have not slept well since about one week after the vaccination  and  I frequently awaken feeling confused, stressed, and disoriented.  This is not normal for me.    Additionally, about 3 weeks after the vaccine I had another mild panic attack.  I have not been troubled by panic attacks before getting the vaccine.  As of today I am starting to feel less glitchy in my thinking. I am still not sleeping soundly and waking often, sometimes accompanied with confusion.

At 15 minutes I talked with the nurse, she looked at and we talked for quite a bit what I should do but I was feeling just fine and left to go home and take benedryl. I had just left the hospital (25 mins post shot) and my throat and tongue started swell rapidly. I called 911 and the county rescue responded. My breathing was normal by then. My body has been itchy all over since then and my throat remains minor swollen. I did not get an epi shot since I was mostly okay and the EMTs were convinced I had a panic attack so I just went home.

These spread to my upper extremities and became consistent. Occasionally will appear in lips and trunk. These are associated with sensation of numbness and some discomfort in my extremities. I&#39;m also experiencing significant brain fog, difficulty concentrating, and fatigue. Headaches are occurring about every other day.  Symptoms are present currently and have remained relatively consistent in severity.  Was evaluated by urgent care on December 28 and encouraged to observe. Was evaluated in the ER by neurology on January 4. There leading hypothesis is vaccine related immune response. Neurologic exam was largely normal, being evaluated by a specialist in the coming days.

A non-pregnant 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: Unknown), intramuscularly in the left arm on 19Dec2020 at 37-years-old at a SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included intermittent asthma from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: mild asthma attack on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, moderate dyspnea on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, chest pressure on 21Dec2020 with outcome of recovering, a 4-5 cm area of induration in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, mild erythema in her left deltoid area in Dec2020 with outcome of unknown. The patient had intermittent asthma with no attacks in the past six years. Two days after the vaccination, she had a mild asthma attack when she was walking up stairs. For the past two days, she has had multiple asthma attacks, with moderate dyspnea and chest pressure present for most of the day. The patient&#39;s symptoms have been improving with her as needed (PRN) salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler. The physician saw the patient in a telemedicine visit and found her to have an asthma exacerbation; therefore, prednisone was prescribed. The patient had no symptoms of viral infection and reported testing negative for COVID-19 after the onset of her asthma symptoms. The physician suspected her asthma exacerbation to have been caused by the vaccine because she had been symptom-free in recent years and she has not had a new exposure other than the vaccine. In addition to her respiratory symptoms, the patient had a 4-5 cm area of induration and mild erythema in her left deltoid area; this appeared about 1 week after she received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of mild asthma attack, moderate dyspnea, chest pressure. The patient, since the vaccination, had been tested for COVID-19. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.

At 0845, she came to me and reported that her shoulder was achy and the pain rated 4/10 was radiating to her back. I checked the injection site and arm and it was not red, raised, or warm. Pt did not have any other symptoms, just the achy shoulder. Pt also reported a brief burning sensation in her shoulder that subsided within 1 minute. She later felt that same sensation in her forearm and it also subsided. It was recommended that she go to the ED for monitoring since the pain was radiating further from her shoulder. ED RN took her in at 0905 and I left.

A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EH9899) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 09:00 on left deltoid at a single dose for COVID-19 prophylaxis. The patient medical history, family history and relevant tests were reported as none. Current concomitant medications included multivitamin took 2 chewable gummies sporadically for years as supplementation therapy. The patient previously took Flu shots she got a sore arm. It was not bad. Tetanus gives her a sore arm, but that was all. Caller wanted to know what she should do for preparation to safely get second dose of Covid vaccine and how to fix what she was feeling right now, making sure it doesn&#39;t get worse, considering she is still having symptoms. Caller stated that she had side effects of tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat. The transferring agent stated that he has a caller on the line that was calling about the Covid-19 Vaccine and reported that the patient got the shot on the 19Dec2020 and was inquiring about to proceed with her weird side effects. Caller had not told her physician about her symptoms yet. Caller clarified that she said a half an hour after the dose on 19Dec2020 09:30 she said that she had a Globus sensation or like a lump in her throat. Caller also reported that the back of her tongue felt swollen. Caller said that the Globus sensation was intermittent and it was not as prominent now as it was. Caller said that it was medically significant, but she has not sought medical treatment yet. Caller said that she still had a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site. She said that the injection was high but reported that she did not have a lot of injection site pain, it very minimal. No emergency room or physician office required. The outcome of the event tongue felt swollen and globus sensation in her throat was recovering and the outcome of the event a bruise or ecchymosis at the injection site was not recovered and the outcome of the event minimal injection site pain was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the events. Causality cannot be completely excluded.

My eye started to hurt with pressure. The tingling in my arm and hand went away after 30 minutes or so but there was still some tingling of my face, toungue and the pressure of the eye still remained. That night I took a Zyrtec and felt better for a few days. on 1/8 I started to feel tinging in my tongue and pressure in my right eye again. I took Zyrtec that night and it went away. Currently this morning I feel okay and hope it wont come back.

She had a mild headache when she woke up on 18Dec2020 06:00, which then developed into a severe migraine on 22Dec2020 08:00 that she has had for 2 weeks and dizziness continues. She received it at work and there was no prescriber. She called and left a message with Pfizer but has not heard back from anyone yet about this. She would say the flushed and dizziness would be medically serious because she had allergies and had medication on board. She takes daily allergy medication and Zantac and not sure she would not have had a worse reaction if she hadn&#39;t had that on board. She took it every night. She had an H1 and H2 blocker on board. Flushed has improved but the dizziness has stayed constant. She had been treated twice for headache and now they have put her on a Prednisone taper. She got it on her right arm so she could work her arm out. On 22Dec2020, she saw a Neurologist for the Migraine. They gave her Toradol 30 mg and Zofran 4mg injection in office. They were given IM. Then, she had another office visit for urgent care on 02Jan2021, and that was for the exacerbation of the migraine. They prescribed 1 liter of fluids and then another Toradol injection, Zofran injection and Decadron injection. The dose of the Toradol was 30 mg, Decadron was 6 mg, and Zofran was 4mg. These were given IV in urgent care. The patient had no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The outcome of flushed/Got flushed was resolving. The outcome of other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events flushing, dizziness, headache and migraine.

                                                Covid toes, red tender slightly swollen toes with mild purple discoloration at the tip of toes, developed 3 days after receiving the first vaccine dosage in the series.  I have tested negative for covid as of 1/10/21.  It was initially thought that I had a skin infection from clipping my nails too short and was prescribed doxyclycline. I saw an improvement within a few days on the antibiotic but them saw a reappearance of the covid toes presenting symptoms on 1/8/21. I have since been told by a physician that I likely have covid toes and not a bacterial infection. I was told to take baby asprin and that is helping to reduce the symptoms.   In the past few weeks I have had no symptoms of Covid besides the appearance of covid toes. I understand that covid toes are often a latent symptom and that the timing of the appearance of this symptom could be coincidental. I am mildly concerned that the first vaccine dosage could have caused a flair up of a potential previous covid infection or could have caused the red covid toes symptom itself.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

This 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL0140), via an unknown route, on 19Dec2020 at 16:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccine location was arm left. The patient was not pregnant. The patient was vaccinated at hospital, age at vaccination was 37-year-old. No other vaccine was received in four weeks.

At 2300,  I started to have fever/chills, up to 39 C orally. This only partially responded to Tylenol. I was not able to sleep.  At 2:30 am I noticed an unusual headache, 8/10, as well as bilateral eye pain on Moving eyes side to side as well as sensitivity to light. Headache was mostly frontal, which came and went every few minutes  until exactly 11:38 am on 1/14/2021, when the fever and myalgias very suddenly got significantly better. Almost exactly 24 hrs to the minute after injection. On 1/15/2021, I still have significant pain in my left arm, swelling, redness and, now, itching at the injection site. My lower back still hurts.

She said she did to morphine. Her bp was 119/74 with a pulse of 94. She said her nose was starting to get itchy, her ears and scalp were itchy, and her eyes were blurry. She had red blotches all over her neck and chest. She said her throat was tight. She was able to swallow the water she requested. I gave her 50mg of benadryl.  She had no visible signs of being unable to breathe. I explained to her we could call 911. She reported she had no insurance. She said she was on her lunch break at the hospital and wanted to get back. She did walk back across the street unassisted. Clinical observer, followed her over just to verify she made it in the building. She ended up checking herself into the ER instead of returning to her shift.

                                                Within 2 minutes post vaccination i started feeling loss of sense of myself. I could not pinpoint if i felt dizzy or vertiginous. Felt like i was off balance and i was super vernous to walk. Vertiginous episodes come and go with peaks for at least 10 times. The whole episode lasted 4 hours until i felt going back to myself.   I was provided water, 1 L and orange juice, there was epi available. No anaphylactic symptoms, no shortness of breath.   I drank 1,5 L of fluids and then my BP was checked 120/80, HR 80s.  I note that i never felt syncopal,  no diaphoresis, nausea, nor darkened vision and i was fully interactive with the bystanders.  Note, i am a critical care intensivist so i had full grasp of the issue but i could now quite describe the sensation of this acute loss of instability. The best way to describe this was vertigo. Similar episode occured at the first vaccine with COVID, occured after 10 minutes and lasted no more than 30 seconds. I didnt report that then because i thought it was just dehydration.

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                This is a 37 y.o. woman who developed an episode of acute self-limited hemolysis just over a week following her second injection of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  She has been treated with ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine immediately prior to the episode for a urinary tract infection.  She had no history of hemolysis prior to this episode.  She was in her usual state of health and received COVID-19 vaccines on 12/24 and 1/14 with the Pfizer vaccine and had no serious side effects at that time.  She then developed dysuria and was seen by telehleath by her primary care physician who prescribed ciprofloxacin and phenazopyridine for her for 3 days ending 1/22.  She took these and her dysuria resolved, however the day after developed what appeared to be blood in her urine.  Then in the following 2 days which were a weekend this worsened and she started feeling poorly.  She also noted that she appeared yellow.  On Monday 1/25 her boyfriend took her to urgent care and she was subsequently sent to an ER at the hospital that referred her to our hospital.  There she was evaluated for gross hematuria with no evidence of urinary bleeding and found to be anemic due to hemolysis.  Her hemoglobin was in the 5&#39;s and she received 2 units of PRBCs.  She was transferred here to Medical Center for further management.  After the initial transfusion she did not require blood transfusion and her hemoglobin continued to increase until it was 10.4 on 2/1 which was the day of discharge.  At a follow up appointment on 2/8/2021 she was recovering and feeling well.   Her jaundice had resolved.   No treatment was given from the hemolysis aside from the blood transfusion and it was self-limited.  It is most likely that her acute hemolysis was due to the phenazopyridine as this agent is known to cause hemolysis and she took it for 3 days prior to the onset of hemolysis.  She has no prior history of drug induced hemolysis and had not taken this medication previously.  As this occurred just over a week following her second vaccination I cannot exclude that is could be related to the vaccine.

A contactable 38-year-old female Nurse (patient)  reported that she received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730, Expiry Date: 31Mar2021) at single dose since 22Dec2020.  Relevant history and concomitant drug was none. The patient excepted Covid 19 vaccine could decrease the chance of contacting Covid 19 virus, while she stated she was getting a red patchy hives and itchy waves of red rashes all over the body just after received the vaccine. The patient (nurse) stated, &#34;I would if I can explain a little more, the day after I received the Covid vaccine I had noticed a big like what I would explain it like a red hives, like a raised red rash on my left hip it last like a day its subsided and next morning I woke up and I had a different flares that was the same on my other side of my body again went away. After a day when I woke up and I had two new spot on my knee that was the other thing, those went away on that day. This morning I woke up and I had another one on my shoulder and on my lower back. I am also thinking I am getting one may be on my ear like I said they pop up and they itch a little and they go away. I never ever experienced anything like it and I see the only thing that I have changed in my life or regimen or added to my body so I just wanted to make sure it was reported. I am nervous and curious if it is a potential side effect added if I should be careful before getting second one all those things.&#34;  No treatment was received for the events. Outcome of events was unknown. When probed for the Causality, the nurse stated, &#34;I have no idea, if it is something going on with me that is completely unrelated its just occurred right after I got the vaccine so I have no idea if this is a separate issue or not. I going to see dermatologist and physician but until then I just thought to report it to you all to see if anybody is experiencing this and to know if it is safe to go for second dose.&#34;

A 38-years-old female patient started to receive BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), lot number: EL1284, via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm, on 29Dec2020 at around 17:15 (at the age of 38 years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure, diagnosed about 15 years ago. There were no concomitant medications.  It was not known if the patient received any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 30Dec2020, the patient experienced fatigue, fever, chills, headache and sweating. The clinical course was as follows: The patient reported that she started developing symptoms after having the COVID vaccine on 29Dec2020. On 30Dec2020, she was fatigued. The headache started earlier in the day. She did not have a thermometer on hand but she thought she had a fever and chills. She was wrapped up because she was so cold. She took 600mg of Ibuprofen around 13:30, which she thought broke her fever because she was sweating. She was still fatigued but not as bad as when she had a fever. The clinical outcome of the fever and chills was recovered, for the fatigue was recovering; the headache was not recovered; the outcome of the sweating was not reported. It was not known if she was tested for COVID-19 after the vaccination.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), intramuscular in right arm on 26Dec2020 11:30 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The COVID-19 vaccine was given at nurse&#39;s hospital vaccine clinic. Medical history included narcolepsy with cataplexy. Concomitant medication in two weeks included venlafaxine hydrochloride (EFFEXOR SR), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took naproxen and erythromycin; and experienced drug allergy.  On 26Dec2020, the patient stated &#34;At about 1150 my tongue started to get a little bit of numbness and tingling. I didn&#39;t really feel nervous but I thought maybe some type of anxious reaction. So I thought I&#39;d give it just a little time and over the next 20 minutes the numbness and tingling progressed to the roof of my mouth, my gums, my lower lip, underneath my tongue, up my cheeks and up underneath my eyes on both sides. I was not feeling anxious about the vaccination. I didn&#39;t have any trouble breathing or difficulty swallowing. It felt like Novocain that was wearing off like after you have dental work done. I decided to take 25mg Benadryl to see if it went away. And it definitely got better about 25 minutes after I took the Benadryl. Within an hour I would say it was 95% gone. Still just like a trace numbness on my cheeks. When I woke up this morning (27Dec2020) I noticed the facial numbness had completely resolved.&#34; The adverse event start time also reported as 11:45 AM. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was recovered on 27Dec2020.  Information on the Batch/Lot number has been requested.

                                                1150 Post injection my tongue started to feel numb and tingling.   Tongue started to swell.  Over the next 20 minutes the numbness and tingling progressed to the roof of my mouth, my gums, my lower lip, underneath my tongue, up my cheeks, and underneath my eyes on both sides.  Because it kept slowly progressing I took 25 mg oral Benadryl. About 20 minutes after the Benadryl I noticed that my tongue didn?t feel or look as swollen.  Within an hour I would say 95% better.   I just had some trace numbness on my cheeks bilaterally.  Symptoms returned again about 12 hours later. Again took Benadryl, this time 50 mg. All symptoms have resolved

A 38-year-old female patient received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot Number EK5730), intramuscular in the left arm on 28Dec2020 at 12:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for Covid-19 vaccination. edical history included trigeminal neuritis in the past twice, first from herpes simplex virus (HSV1) and second from flu shot a few years ago; acne and recurrent oral HSV 1, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient was allergic to sulfa. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included drospirenone, ethinylestradiol (LORYNA) for OCP; prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), short course completed prior to vaccination; beclometasone dipropionate (QNASL); xylometazonline hychrochloride (SUDAFED) which was stopped before vaccination; valaciclovir hydrochloride (VALTREX); ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C) which was stopped before vaccination and multivitamins. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 28Dec2020 at 12:45, the patient experienced left sided mild case of trigeminal neuritis that persisted beyond 48 hours with symptoms of numbness with decreased sensation on lateral part of V2 trigeminal nerve which started 10-15 mins after vaccination with small spot corner of mouth on left and involved lateral part of entire left side of face from corner of left eye down within 1-2 hours after received vaccine. The patient also experienced headache, borderline intermittent scratchy/sore throat, gritty/sandy sensation in mouth, at 12-14 hours after getting vaccine on 28Dec2020; got burning/tingling on tongue and then lost taste 100% for about 1 hour then started to slightly come back-and waxed and waned until later that evening and most was back to normal except sweet taste still gone. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office visit. Therapeutic measures were taken for all of the events which included antihistamines and valaciclovir; and for the trigeminal neuritis only, methylprednisolone pack. The clinical outcome of the event trigeminal neuritis was recovering (lasted longer than 48 hours after vaccination); for headache, stomatitis, throat irritation, oropharyngeal pain, ageusia, tongue discomfort and paraesthesia oral was recovered (at 48 hours after vaccination).

                                                About 15 minutes after the injection I felt a warm sensation throughout my body and it went away immediately. About 10  minutes after that, my throat started feeling scratchy/itchy/tingling, then my tongue and lips. After about 10 minutes it went away. I felt ok so I left the vaccination area and went back to my department I work in. For several hours the same symptoms came and went in waves, lessening over time. At 8:30pm the same day, I took 25 mg PO Benadryl to feel safe while sleeping. I felt fine the next day and reported it to the pharmacist in the vaccination clinic. I never felt like my airway was compromised.

                                                I felt fine after the shot all day. I went to bed at 1030pm, woke up at 1130 hyperventilating (respiratory rate was 40&#43; and I couldn?t lower it),  shaking uncontrollably (felt increasingly cold, though my temp was normal; my skin was cold to the touch but I felt like it was burning off), tachycardic (heart rate was 140bpm and I normally am at 60-80 at rest). My throat felt like it was closing and my face was swollen. I should have gone to the ER, but I wasn?t thinking clearly and didn?t know what to do with my small children.  It took 2 hours until I stopped shaking, my heart rate returned to normal, and my breathing was under control.  Since then I have mainly been fatigued, taking Tylenol for overall aches, and have not been able to tolerate much activity (can only stand for about 5 minutes at a time).

                                                I felt weak and with muscle fatigue the day after the shot. Also had a headache and neck muscle tension and mid back muscle tension. Joint pains as well. These subsided after 48 hours except for the neck and upper back muscle fatigue and mild soreness. This gave me a low grade headaches almost daily since the vaccine. I took ibuprofen a few times which helped. On the 6th I awoke at night and felt weak all over. I felt like I was falling in my bed. Mild dizziness.  I went to work and felt extremely fatigued with muscle weakness but no neuro deficits. I feared some terrible autoimmune illness and took Decadron that day- 4mg tab BID. This helped my muscle weakness but left me with insomnia. The decadron is now wearing off after 4 days and I still have muscle weakness/fatigue. It takes considerable effort walking up the stairs. Yesterday my masseter muscles became fatigued with little chewing. My arms feel heavy when I lift them. The strange thing is that at night when I lie down I feel like my sympathetic nervous system is being triggered. I will get palpitations and feel just strange- I can&#39;t describe it.  I took valium to sleep last night -5 mg tablets that my doctor gave me Saturday as there seems to be an anxiety panic component going on. I have no history of diagnosed anxiety or panic attacks- I have never felt this way before. Today I feel a little better but still have considerable muscle fatigue and neck and upper back muscle soreness and overall muscle tightness in my arms and legs- feels good to stretch kind of feeling. I have mild dizziness when standing up and turning too abruptly. But no considerable focal neuro deficits.

Immediately after receiving the vaccine, patient developed lightheadedness, flushing, hives, wheezing and throat swelling.  Patient was treated in an emergency department with epinephrine, gradually improved and was able to be sent home with an EpiPen, prednisone, hydroxyzine, and famotidine.  The next day, patient again developed shortness of breath and her husband administered the EpiPen.  EMS arrived and gave another dose of IM epinephrine and IV diphenhydramine.  On arrival to the emergency department, the patient was altered, diaphoretic, tachypneic, tachycardic, and stridulous.  Patient was given multiple doses of IM epinephrine and started on epinephrine drip.  Stridor continued and was unresponsive to nebulized albuterol.  Patient was then intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.  Other treatments included solumedrol, pepcid, magnesium sulfate, nebulized epinephrine, and IV fluids.  admitted to the intensive care unit, weaned off epinephrine drip, and extubated the next day.  Patient was monitored on hospital floor for one additional day and was then discharged with no residual symptoms.

Experienced difficulty sleeping the rest of the night due to symptoms and restlessness. Following day, I continued to have fever averaging 100 degrees F, body aches, chills and headache that brought me to tears. That evening, began experiencing severe nausea and involuntary shaking. Reported to ER for management of symptoms. Received fluids, ibuprofen, Zofran and Reglan as well as potassium. It is currently the following Monday so 5 days post vaccine and I continue to have intermittent nausea and headache.

I had a temperature of 99.1. I went to an urgent care and my BP was elevated (very unusual for me) 140/100 and HR 110 and temp still 99.1.  They did a rapid swab on me that was negative. I continued to feel awful the rest of the day. On Sunday the next morning I awoke because I had a very swollen and sore lymph node in my left armpit. I took tylenol and did warm compresses. I had continued fatigue on Sunday and slept the whole day. I also continued with a high heart rate 110-130 with activity. My Bp was 117/70I had a pulse oximeter at home. My temp stayed 99.  Monday morning I woke up feeling better. My HR was in the 80 and temp 98.3 and fatigue is gone. I still have mild soreness in my left arm but the redness is fine and warmth is gone. My left armpit is still sore

                                                Within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my heart began to race and I became very warm and sweaty. I was brought into another room for monitoring and my heart rate was above 100. After some breathing exercises, it came back down to the high 70s for a few minutes but then increased again into the 90s, at one point it was 113. My chest and throat then began to feel tight and I began sweating again. My face also felt funny on my right cheek. At that point I was first given 25 mg of benedryl then epinephrine. I was then taken to the emergency room via ambulance and was observed for approximately an hour. I was given an additional 25 mg of benedryl and discharged at 4:55pm. I was diagnosed with an allergic reaction and prescribed 25 mg of benedryl every 6 hours over the next 24 hours. The following morning, I experienced a hot flash with profuse sweating followed by chills. I was very tired and felt feverish throughout the day on 1/12 and stayed home from work. On 1/13 I still felt tired but was able to work. Today I feel mostly normal but still occasionally have had heart palpitations.

Saw a primary care physician on 1-18-21 and was found to have a raging yeast infection, bacterial vaginitis and urinary tract infection. I haven&#39;t had any of these in 15&#43; years. I was started on antibiotics. Next morning (1-19-21) felt extreme lower abdominal fullness and pressure and extreme nausea. I got in with my OBGYN at 9am same day and he discovered I had an ovarian cyst. He sent me down for an ultrasound and the results showed I had a ruptured ovarian cyst on my left side and an ovarian cyst on my right side. I have never had an ovarian cyst in my life. The next day (1-20-21) the right cyst ruptured. Having all three infections and two ovarian cysts (when I&#39;ve never had one before) lead my OBGYN and I to feel it warranted filing a VARES report

                                                When I got up at 0530 yesterday (1/19) my right arm was so sore I couldn&#39;t lift it. I got to work at 0700 and felt really drained and tired. I fell asleep without realizing it at some point and a coworker saw me and woke me up at 0930. I attended a lecture at 1000 and started feeling chills, aches, and was sweating. I tried to take notes but couldn&#39;t remember how to spell a lot of basic words and couldn&#39;t get my brain to focus.  My boss sent me home at 1145. I was driving home and when I got off the interstate I couldn&#39;t remember which way to turn at the light off the exit. I had to pull up a navigation app on my phone to remember how to get home.  When I got home I took my temperature and it was 98.5F. I slept for 3 hours, picked my kids up from school, and then slept for another 2 hours. I took my temperature at 1900 and it was 98.5F still. My chills and aches had lessened but not disappeared by the time I went to bed at 2100, but by the time my alarm went off at 0530 this morning I felt completely back to normal.

Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

A 38-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as COVID 19, brand= Pfizer/Biontech, lot/batch number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Jan2021 14:45 at SINGLE DOSE for Covid-19 vaccination. She received the vaccine in a facility. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease. No other vaccine in four weeks. Concomitant medications included ergocalciferol (VIT D) and lansoprazole (PREVACID). On 11Jan2021, within about 10 minutes of getting the vaccine she reported that her heart began to race and she became sweaty and uncomfortable. After another 5 minutes or so she began to have difficulty breathing as her chest and throat felt very tight and restricted. She also became lightheaded. Her heart rate was over 100, then dropped into the 70s, then shot back up over 100. Her face had a weird sensation as well. She was given Benadryl first and then epinephrine and had to go to the emergency room via ambulance for observation. She was released after an hour and had to take Benadryl every 6 hours for the next 24 hrs and diagnosed with an allergic reaction. On 12Jan2021,  she had a hot flash upon waking up and felt generally under the weather all day. Her arm was very sore at the injection site. She missed a day of work due to the whole ordeal. On 13Jan2021, she felt more normal but still have some tightness in her chest with a fluttering feeling. The outcome of event diagnosed with an allergic reaction was not recovered; for other events was recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch Number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association and known product safety profile, causality between event allergic reaction to vaccine and BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded.

A 38-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EL8982), intramuscular in the left arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:30 (at the age of 38-years-old) as a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history was not reported. The patient was allergic to penicillin. The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EJ1685) on 28Dec2020 in the left arm. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and cetirizine hydrochloride (ALERTEC), both for unknown indication from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. On 18Jan2021 at 11:00, the patient experienced bad cough, trouble breathing, tingling around mouth, numbness in jaw and neck, shaking, red face and chest, and slight itching. Treatment was given when seen by paramedics with an emergency room visit which included a second dose of allergy medication. The clinical outcome of the events bad cough, trouble breathing, tingling around mouth, numbness in jaw and neck, shaking, red face and chest, and slight itching was recovering. It was reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely causally related to the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), considering the plausible temporal relationship and clinical course of the events.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

I sat down and had a few sips of water.  Within a few minutes, I felt like I was having a difficult time getting a good breath in.   I raised my hands over my head and took slow deep breaths to try and keep my breathing  under control.  I stayed at the hospital for about 45 minutes, over which time I had a few bites to eat and some water.   The flushing and sweating resolved within that time.  The lightheadedness and &#34;feeling of doom&#34; lasted about 3 hours.  I had no anxiety going into this vaccine, nor have I had a reaction like this before.

                                                I got the vaccine in my right arm. About 30 min after the vaccine, I started feeling numbness/tingling in my right jaw/mandible area that spread behind my ear. Over about an hour or 2 I could feel the numbness/tingling/strange sensation move across the top of my right lip and into my right nostril.  I took benadryl and it seemed to stop the spreading but the strange sensation stayed on the right side of my face for about 4 days afterwards.

                                                I received the COVID vaccine on Monday Dec. 21, 2020 at 14:30.  By 17:00 I was not feeling well.  I was tired, had a headache, muscle aches, nausea and a fever of 101 F.   The headache, low grade fever and significant malaise continued through Tues Dec 22 and Wed Dec 23.   On Thursday morning Dec 24 at 2:30 AM, I woke from sleep with the urge to use the bathroom.   I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy and had a diaphoresis that soaked my hair and PJs.   Fortunately my husband who is a nurse anesthetist helped me through the episode safely and was able to get me back to bed.   I am not sure if that event was related to the vaccine or if I happened to be a little dehydrated and had a vaso-vagal event.  I did not take any medications because I was allowing my body to have a natural response to the vaccine.

I vomited about 6 times that day and had diarrhea. Next morning, my face was flushed. I had a low grade fever of 99.5, and checked my BP. On my home machine, my pulse was 135. I decided to go to the hospital. My Apple Watch measured my heart rate to be 150 at one time. At the ER, I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and dehydration. I was placed on oxygen as my levels were between 90-93, and I was given IV fluids. I have felt fatigued since then, some nausea, and mild diarrhea still.

                                                I had a slight headache while at work but was fine. I was home and was a little cold and my throat was scratchy. . Then about 9pm all of a sudden I started to get waves of chills. My hand were cold and my feet were frozen. I layered up with sweater and sweatpants to go to bed with a heavy comforter. I just could not get warm. About 1am, I woke up and put on my thick winter socks on because my feet were still frozen. I kept reminding myself to breathe in deeply.  I checked my BPM and it was 80-82 and normally its about low  70s. I woke up about 5:30am and had a really bad headache, injection area and arm hurt, my  body hurt and felt like I weighed several tons making me so slow. I didn&#39;t go to work the next day. My husband took my son to school and I took ibuprofen and went back to bed. Woke up again about 12:30 and felt better.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

                                                Began with fever, tonsillitis, sore throat, sinus drainage, muscle aches. Then on Saturday night the body aches were progressively worse and concentrated on left side of body. Joints were affected including left wlbow, wrist, shoulder. Hot viral rash appeared on arm right above left elbow that became painful with swelling and  erythema. In Sunday through the following Wednesday, joint pain continued to worsen and settle in additional joints including first 2 metacarpal bones of both hands almost like arthritic pain. Fingers and joints red and swollen. Pain and swelling next settled in toes of both feet, right side elbow, shoulder and knee. On Monday following vaccine I called employee health and they advised me to come and take covid test. I described symptoms and was told they were side effects of the vaccine and to follow up with a doctor if it continues.  My covid test was negative. On the following Thursday I went to urgent care and described my persisting symptoms.  I was prescribed a methylprednisolone pack and hydroxyzine. I was told to use naproxen as needed. Yesterday  the urgent care sent a check up message. I am still experiencing joint pain although the intensity has decreased but it is still significant pain that is disabling my grip and strengrh overall. The joint pain is mostly just in my upper extremities, hands, fingers  and shoulders now consistently. The np prescribed a 10 day pack of meloxicam to try and help minimize the pain.

This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Then on 2/14/2021 I started feeling burning  pain all over my neck and chest. It was slightly red that night. The next morning my chest, neck, and upper back had a red rash . My chest was the worst of it. Felt like a chemical burn . I went to the Doctor on 2/17/2021 and was told it was a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine. I continued to take Benadryl, Zyrtec  and was given Kenalog. On Sunday 2/21/2021 the pain was so pain and the rash was only getting worse and now on my face so I went to urgent care. There I was given a steroid ( prednisone) , derma smoothe and Pepcid. It has been 10 days and no improvement yet.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

A non-pregnant 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 19Jan2021 at 39-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within four weeks of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s medical history included heart murmur, Latex allergy; both from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. Concomitant medications were not reported; and no other medications were received within two weeks of the suspect vaccine. On 19Jan2021, the patient experienced: felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side (non-serious), streaks of heat along the back of her scalp (non-serious), heat in her chest (non-serious), right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder (non-serious), hot flashes (non-serious). The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient, ten minutes after the vaccination, felt intense heat in her armpit lymph nodes on the right side. This was followed by streaks of heat along the back of her scalp, and heat in her chest. After about an hour, the right side felt numb from her leg to her shoulder. The patient&#39;s &#34;body stayed that way for about 20 hours.&#34; The patient also experienced hot flashes, which was not something that she ever had before. The patient feared getting the second dose because her body felt so off after the first dose. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The clinical outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date. The patient was not tested for COVID post vaccination with the suspect vaccine.   The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, bnt162b2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.
