                                                throat tightness; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other healthcare professional (HCP). An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at a single dose in the left deltoid muscle for COVID 19 vaccination. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient denied any history of previous adverse reactions to vaccines and denied reaction to her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) for COVID 19 vaccination on an unspecified date. The patient was seen at a COVID vaccine clinic today for her second dose of the COVID 19 vaccination. She was given the Pfizer vaccination in the left deltoid muscle. During her 15-minute waiting period after the injection, the patient began to experience throat tightness on Jan2021. Treatment included: Benadryl 25mg po (orally) and Solumedrol 125mg IM. The event did not result in death, not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, not disabling/incapacitating, did not cause congenital anomaly/birth defect. The outcome of the event was unknown.     No follow-up attempts are possible. Information about lot/batch has been obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of throat tightness cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship. Sever allergic reaction is the known risk for the product.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I woke up this morning (approx 18 hrs post injection of my 2nd dose) feeling some myalgia, joint pain (perhaps 7/10 on a pain scale) and fatigue. I was able to work out (exercise bike 30 mins) and shower despite the pain. Then, around noon today (nearly 24 hrs post injection) I began feeling increasingly dizzy and warm. I stood to go to my bed and lost consciousness and collapsed.   I was only unconscious for perhaps 15 seconds. I woke up feeling very shaky and cold and breathing rapidly. I was able to slow my respirations. My skin on my face and hands was very pale (lips were whitish blue). My housemate had called 911 for me: FD showed up and took a couple sets of orthostatic vitals.  My BP when seated on the floor was around 110/80, pulse 80, and my BP when standing was around 90/70, pulse 100. I was able to walk to the bed without help so I decided to stay home and just hydrate, sleep, and keep a close eye on things.   Now (1620, around 4 hrs after passing out). I still feel lots of soreness, but only very minor dizziness.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  I did not experience any symptoms until the night following the vaccination.  Around 3:30am (01/14/2021), I was awoken by intense chills.  I was restless throughout the rest of the night, having hot and cold flashes.  I woke up around 8:20am and felt that I had a subjective fever.  I was also experiencing intense body ache and headache.  I took my temperature and it showed to be 100.6şF.  I was still experiencing chills despite also feeling hot at the same time.  After an hour, my temperature was 101şF.  I took 2 naproxen sodium tablets (440mg) to relieve fever.  Around 10:45am, my fever reduced but my body ache and headache stayed at the same pain level.  Around 2pm, I took 2 tablets of ibuprofen (400mg).  My headache stopped around 8:00pm.  My body aches stopped the morning of 01/15/2021.

Felt fine, no symptoms or side effects until 12/31/2020 I did get hives on my arm site where I received the vaccine and those hives then started to spread throughout my body. I started having hives and rashes all over for a total of 6 days .

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. This case is serious, the other one is non-serious.   A 22-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EH9899) intramuscular at left deltoid on 22Dec2020 19:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No other vaccines given at the same time. The patient received a flu shot back between 27th or 28th Nov2020 in her left deltoid. Caller reported getting the COVID vaccine on the 22Dec2020 and feeling fine before that. On the 28Dec2020 she started feeling chills and not feeling very good and that hasn&#39;t gone away. The patient went and got a rapid COVID test and it came back positive, not sure if it was because of the vaccine having antigens in it or she came into contact with it or if she just weakened immune system from the shot. The patient wanted to know if that was true. Then stated she and her mom got the COVID vaccine and her mom received it on the 23Dec. On the 29Dec her whole family started to get sick and experiencing the same things she experienced. The patient was not feeling well at the time of the call. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : 2021001266 same reporter/ drug, different patient/event

This nurse reported similar events for 3 patients. This is the first of 3 reports.  A 23-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EK9231, intramuscular in the right deltoid, first dose on 27Dec2020 14:15 at a single dose for covid-19 prevention. Medical history included ongoing asthma and reactive airway which she was diagnosed when she was like 5 years old (2002). Concomitant medication included albuterol [salbutamol] for asthma which started when she was 8 years old or so. The patient wanted to know if she can receive the second dose of covid vaccine after experiencing symptoms of allergic reaction like rash, tightness in throat, and lump in throat. She wanted to know the ingredients and specific proteins in the covid vaccine. The patient received the COVID Vaccine and she developed a reaction. On 27Dec2020, she had a red rash on her chest, and her cheeks were flushed, and the rash was on her arms too, and she had a tightness and lump in her throat, it was not painful to swallow but she could feel the pressure with swallowing. She stated that she did not experience shortness of breath, but regardless, she was seen in the ER and she was given IV SOLUMEDROL, and BENADRYL, and she was watched for 5 or 6 hours and then she was sent home with an Epi Pen, around the clock Benadryl, and prednisone. She asked the ER doctors if they thought it was okay for her to receive the second dose of the product, and they told her to contact employee health for that question. She mentioned that she contacted that employee health and was told to contact her primary care provide which she did. Her primary care doctor instructed the caller to call Pfizer and gather some more information regarding ingredients, as the she may have had the reaction to a particular protein filler. She was also wondering if this is a known reaction to the product. She received the vaccine on 27Dec2020 at 2:15 PM. She reported that the red rash on her chest and arms, and her cheeks being flushed, resolved yesterday after receiving IV BENADRYL. Had a tightness and lump in her throat which was still ongoing, and it was kind of off and on and when the she takes Benadryl it goes away. She reported that this one is medically significant because even though she did not have shortness of breath, it could have affected her airway. She confirmed that she received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events &#39;had a tightness and lump in her throat&#39;, allergic reaction was not recovered (a s reported); while recovered on 27Dec2020 for allergic reaction like rash/red rash on her chest and rash was on her arms too and cheeks were flushed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between bnt162b2 and the events throat tightness, sensation of foreign body, allergy to vaccine, rash erythematous and flushing cannot be excluded. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2020517134 different patient, same drug and same event;US-PFIZER INC-2020517133 different patient, same drug and same event.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird. All test were negative. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. Events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102 were serious with criteria of medically significant, while the other events were non-serious. The outcome of the event Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling/Sore throat (Condition worsened) was unknown, the outcome of the events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102., Migraine, Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids, Frequent urination was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal association. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

On 01/08  ~5 PM I began to develop  a fever that reached a peak of 102.4 at 4am (01/09), despite taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours. Last fever recorded 01/09 ~9PM of 99.5 (while still taking 1000 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours).  Additional symptoms have been severe nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness, bilateral lower back pain with some mild bruising to the kidney region, difficulty breathing,  chest pressure, shortness of breath along with a cough upon exertion (developed ~6 PM 01/08), which is still present today (01/10 1:25 PM), and an erythematous rash that covers the anterior side of the right forearm, from wrist to elbow (first noticed on 01/10 ~11 AM).

I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

                                                I woke up in the morning feeling some mild body aches. When I tried to stand up I became dizzy and immediately sat down. I started sweating, my vision started to turn black and I felt that like I was going to faint. I then became extremely nauseated and threw up. after about ten minutes the symptoms started mildly passing. I then began sweating again, feeling like I was going to faint, and I threw up a second time. These symptoms lasted for about an hour where I felt nauseous and faint. Then flowing these symptoms I felt dizzy for another 3 hours and continued having body aches for another 2 days.

Now on day 4 of this reaction, it has grown bigger and the pain is intense and spread all the way down my arm and to my breasts. My arm will go numb from time to time as well. I am also feeling as if I should have a fever but I do not and feel overall not well.

                                                The first day 1/07/21 I started with a pain on my throat , my throat felt really sore however I was still able to eat . The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

                                                Rash consisting of hives or small red bumps suddenly appeared on upper body (arms, chest, upper back) the morning of 12/26/20. Rash continued to spread to lower back and stomach over the next few days with the left arm being the most affected area. Facial redness and swelling occurred however breathing was never affected.  Benadryl did not provide much relief. Visited an urgent care which classified it as an allergic reaction and started 5 day course of prednisone on 12/28/2020. Symptoms resolved upon completion of the prednisone. Total duration of symptoms was approximately one week. I had not used any new skin products or eaten any foods new to my diet and nothing else comes to mind as a potential contributing factor.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 22Dec2020 (at the age of 23-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: allergies to medications, food, or other products (unspecified). It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 22Dec2020, approximately 8 minutes after vaccine administration, the patient began feeling flushed. She reported to the observation area, and the registered nurse noted hives on her left neck (22Dec2020). The patient was brought back for closer monitoring. The doctor evaluated the patient. Vital signs were monitored every 5 minutes (22Dec2020). The patient was given 50 mg diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) orally. Some improvement was noted in hives; however, the patient began to state her tongue felt &#34;thick&#34; and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; (both on 22Dec2020). Per doctor, 0.3 mg epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) given intramuscularly with rapid improvement in hives. The patient reported feeling some improvement as well. The patient was taken to the emergency department for ongoing observation. The patient was released from emergency department after observation. The clinical outcome of flushed, hives, tongue felt &#34;thick&#34;, and &#34;the lump in my throat feels bigger&#34; was recovered on an unspecified date.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the events flushing, urticaria, tong disorder, sensation of foreign body are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

                                                also had a very hoarse voice; throat starting feeling a little tight; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other HCP (patient). A 24-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EK9231), intramuscular on 31Dec2020 15:45 at single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic sinusitis from an unknown date and seasonal allergies from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included azithromycin. The patient previously took penicillin and experienced allergies. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. It was reported that within 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine on 31Dec2020, the patient&#39;s throat started feeling a little tight. However, she did not have trouble breathing. The feeling continued for the next 3 hours. She also had a very hoarse voice. The ER suggested that she will be seen. They did an exam and gave her Benadryl which completely resolved her symptoms. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 24-year-old female patient (currently 25-years-old) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 24-years-old) on 06Jan2021 12:45 at 0.3 mL, single in right deltoid for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899, expiry date: 31Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month on 09Jan2021 13:00 with outcome of not recovered. She reported, &#34;I&#39;ve had both doses of the vaccine. The last one was on 06Jan2021. I have had a swollen lymph node under clavicle for a month.&#34; She says she got the second dose 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 she was at the doctor&#39;s office and he felt what he thought is a swollen lymph node like under her clavicle, it is the size of a golf ball now, it is not going away. She says the swollen lymph node is under the clavicle on her left side. The doctor didn&#39;t seem too concerned about it but it has been almost a month and it is still there she doesn&#39;t know what it is but it is still there. She confirms the second dose was 06Jan2021 and on 09Jan2021 her doctor noticed it was swollen, she didn&#39;t even notice it before he did. She thinks it has gotten worse but she also might be freaking out for no reason but she thinks it has gotten bigger. She says she has the information for the first dose but the second dose is on another card because she forgot the card when she went back for the second dose. The information for the second dose is at home and she is not at home right now. She does not see an NDC Number. She says the lot number information could be available later if needed for follow up because the card is at home. Dose: It is not on the card but she thinks it is 0.3 ml, she doesn&#39;t remember for sure. At the time she got the dose she was being treated for ring worm. Her doctor did draw a Calcium and a PTH and they were both normal. She says the doctor was not too concerned about but it has been almost a month and it still has not gone down (as reported). She has asthma which she has been dealing with kind of on and off because this winter has been so cold but other than that nothing else has happened, her vitals are normal she did not even have any temperature or anything after the vaccine. The event was assessed as non-serious. Vaccination Facility Type was hospital. The adverse event did not require a visit to the Emergency Room or Physician Office. It was noted while she was in the doctors office but she has not had to go back for it. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Even clothing lightly touching my skin felt like hot razors cutting in to me. Residual swelling of the face/ arm. Migraine. For two weeks after - Very large, hard lump under my skin at the injection site. It was about the size of my hand and was very painful. After a few weeks it went away.  Treatment- large amounts of benadryl. The pharmacist wanted to use an epipen and send me to the hospital, but I refused because I could still get some air in (doctor later told me that my reaction was so severe I should have gone to the hospital). I had to keep taking large amounts of benadryl for the next few days to keep the reaction down a bit.

                                                Almost immediately to maybe 3 minutes after I received the vaccine my tongue started tingling and the sides of my tongue began to burn. I also had a slight red rash on my chest that began to burn and itch. These are similar to the reaction I have after I eat cinnamon. It wasn?t severe like my shellfish allergy where I go into anaphylactic, but it was definitely a reaction. My tongue was then slightly swollen that day into the next day. Very slightly swollen. Just enough that I noticed it because I kept biting my tongue. The burning and tingling lasted for maybe an hour after. I was slightly dizzy as well, but nothing too bad.  I was seen by the ER team to make sure I didn?t go into anaphylactic and then I was allowed to return home. Others I walked by stated my face was bright red and I got very hot.   Following that I had extreme exhaustion. I couldn?t even make it home without having to pull my car over to try and wake myself up. I am feeling fine now, but just wanted to make this known for study purposes. I plan on getting the second shot on 1-19-21.

                                                Immediately after vaccine I had a bad headache which was cleared up with Ibuprofen. Then 12 Hours after vaccine my arm became VERY sore, took my ibuprofen and alternated with Acetaminophen.  Then my face became very flushed (I used ice packs) and I got a mild sore throat. That night I had difficulty sleeping. I kept waking up with terrible body aches. About 24 hours after the vaccine I just had fatigue, mild fever, and chills. I slept on and off throughout the day and then started to feel better. But at about 32 hours post vaccine I started to feel worse. My headache and sore arm came back and I became very light headed and dizzy.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

A contactable consumer (patient&#39;s father) and a non-contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported that a 25-year-old female patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. After a few days on 25Dec2020, patient started to experience reactions, like a tingling reaction on her arms, body, and also swelling of the face, and she also started to have headaches. It has been like that for a while, and patient who is a health care professional was brought to the emergency room, to check on what was going on, but she was not able to get the medication they need, it was twice that the consumer he tried to bring the patient to emergency, and she still hasn&#39;t gotten medication for the symptoms. She started having reactions, she had numbness in the face and tingling,  headaches, tingling in the hands and arms, and weakness in the arms and legs, extremity weakness, she felt like fatigue and also in the back, she had pain and soreness in the vertebrae in the middle going down. She has been to emergency 3 times, the last time was yesterday, and so the one thing he needs to report to Pfizer is doctors don&#39;t seem to know what to look for, they have no idea, they are looking at other things instead of looking at vaccine side effects, the patient never had problems before the vaccine, but after she started all of these side effects, they need to be looking at what can cause with the vaccine, the first time, yesterday on (03Jan2021) they did a brain MRI because of headache, as they are concerned about nerves in the brain, but a neurologist will see her sometime this month. At this time, they are ruling out things, analyzing the MRI, she did get some medication for pain, and all that stuff since she was suffering with,headache and was sent home last night. Since they said they cannot admit her, as they are afraid she could get COVID 19 in the hospital, but they make sure she is ok, and at this point, all her knows, he hasn&#39;t talked to her since last night, and hoping she is sleeping, as she hasn&#39;t been able to sleep in a few days, about probably 6 or 7 days. The consumer  was wondering, it may be necessary to call the patient directly, to talk more directly to her. The patient also did have on her forehead was a spot in the middle that was raised, kind of like a raised area, from that area, it is radiating heat, she feels her forehead hot from that spot, and they take her temperature with the new handheld touchless thermometer, and it radiates heat like 100.2 to perhaps 100.4 (Dec2020). It always raises a question at these appointments, but then they take her temperature orally and it&#39;s 98 degrees (Dec2020). It was also mentioned that the patient was experiencing tingling reaction in the arms, headache, swelling, numbness in her face, and a bump on her forehead with a high temperature. These symptoms were there until yesterday, the Emergency room gave her some medicine, but the consumer hasn&#39;t heard from her, his patient was home, they haven&#39;t talked since last night. The consumer was hoping she was able to sleep. The consumer stated that the patient was given medicine, it was give to relax her, but it is like a bandaid, not a cure. Now, the consumer stated that the patient said her symptoms were the same symptoms, headache, numbness, everything after last night, she was still with problems. The patient had the very first one, at this point, the consumer doesn&#39;t know about the second one, the way she is doing. It was given to all the people she works with, most of the people, the patient works in a hospital, she is a respiratory therapist, it was given to them as they are exposed to all that the COVID 19 in a hospital. Yesterday on 03Jan2021, brain MRI, results showed that the patient was told her that everything looks, initially, looks clear good, but a neurologist will look at the report in detail. and rule out any other conditions, she  has to be followed up with by a neurologist, the appointment is pending. The patient&#39;s mother asked on behalf of her daughter if this department going to be contacting the doctor for help with resolution about to resolve the health issues, what is to be expected. She added, &#34;What are people doing when they have these severe side effects, what is Pfizer doing for them, besides taking down information, which is helping Pfizer, what helps the patient resolve side effects from the vaccine?&#34; The patient&#39;s father stated that it seems to them, his daughter went 3 times to Emergency, the first time they said good luck with that, second time, this and that she is ok, go home, and the third time, at least they did a brain MRI, and gave her some medicine, now this morning, she is back to where she was before she went to the ER. He asked, &#34;Why is there not more documentation, more information provided to doctors that have take care of patients, it seems to be a small group of people with these side effects, and it is really hard, the question they have is, this suffering, why doesn&#39;t Pfizer be more active in helping people, now they are investigating that, doing research to him seems like some feedback s not necessarily directed to the patient, as they are trying to take care of themselves, but to call the doctor helping her, to know a better lead to be able to help her, his daughter has missed a lot of work, has a lot of headaches, where is the hope for this to go away? What can Pfizer do to the medical community, to help them?&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headaches. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

                                                fatigue; Throat tightness; sore throat; Rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 25-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 06Mar2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EN6025) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies: Penicillin. No other vaccine received in four weeks. Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), took the week prior to receiving the vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin and experienced rash (Amoxicillin tablets. Had allergic reaction when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime).   The patient experienced sore throat, throat tightness and rash, all on 06Mar2021 14:30. Clinical course: After receiving COVID 19 Vaccine, within one to two minutes of vaccine very strong sore throat and tightening of the throat. Was taken to emergency room by the ambulance that was at the testing center. At that time the ambulance at testing center recommended taking two Benadryl&#39;s, which started to work and sore throat and tightness completely went away about 15 minutes after that and then started to come back at time of riding in ambulance to the ER. While being written up and vitals checked, the rash (blotchy) developed to which she was given a Solumedrol steroid shot to fix the rash which amazingly cleared up rash and it ended up back to white. Had amazing clear photos of rash and it being red and sloshes starting to appear. After caller left ER and went home and had couple of follow up prescriptions of Pepcid and Atarax to help combat rash for two days. Now she was taking Allegra still for adverse events. Reporter mentioned sore throat was on and off but it had improved and still had a little bit of a rash. Caller had a little bit of tightness and it had improved if she exerted herself a lot the tightness got worse she wsn&#39;t referring to a big exertion but provided example like if she is going to the grocery store. The rash was severely reduced but was apparent. Caller also mentioned she had pretty severe fatigue after receiving vaccine unsure if this was because of the vaccine or an allergic reaction to some medication in her. She missed work on Monday and part time on Tuesday due to having to take breaks and naps during the day. Caller went into work but she did not feel up to working a full day in the office and was working remotely from home right now. The patient had allergic reaction to amoxicillin tablets when taken 5-7 years ago and did experience similar skin rash, this is the only other reaction in lifetime. Caller stated she knew how important it is to report not sure if there is an association between Amoxicillin and COVID ingredients. May have another allergy that was contributing but Amoxicillin was only other known allergy. Caller was asking for the next steps since she still has not fully recovered her throat, she is still feeling sore and tighter than normal and her skin was still redder than normal. When she had the rash it was red blotchy and warm to the touch it was no longer warm to the touch. Outcome of the events sore throat, throat tightness and rash was recovering, of event fatigue was unknown.
