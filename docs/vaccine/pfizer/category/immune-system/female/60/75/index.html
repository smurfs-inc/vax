This 60-year-old female nurse (patient) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Dec2020 to 23Dec2020 at 0.3 mL single on left deltoid to prevent getting the COVID vaccine, for protection. Medical history included ongoing asthma diagnosed in her mid twenties, in the 80s, she had asthma when she was a child, then it stopped and resurfaced in her mid twenties, ongoing eczema diagnosed years already, a long time ago and unspecified allergies with medications.  There were no concomitant medications. She received the vaccine on 23Dec2020. She has a lot of allergies in Dec2020, and had some side effects, and she got through it ok. Her side effects were some swelling of arm, a rash developed, like 5cm x 4cm at site of injection, chills and shivers, and a bronchospasm cough on 24Dec2020. Arm swelling event started 24 hours later, no more, it was stable for 24 hours, and the 3rd day, went down, was a little raised, the next day was flat but still red. She had recovered completely. The 4th day was a good day. The patient stated she had some allergy shots she had to go through before, this was no different. Rash was no more, it was gone by 27Dec2020. She was still able to go to work. Chills and shivers started 24 hours later, and took for 48 hours intermittently, she had since recovered completely. The patient stated this was all nothing different than getting like the flu shot. Bronchospasm cough event only took another 48 hours, the difference was, even when she calls it bronchospasm, it was close to when she had an asthma attack, but no chest tightness, shortness of breath, she just would cough, spasm in Dec2020 and stop. She had recovered completely. The patient stated she had no symptoms at all before the vaccine, she was healthy, she made sure nothing was going on, that she was not tired, had no cold, she took no medications for this, as she wanted to know how her body reacted and if it can handle it. They says it was ok to take paracetamol (TYLENOL), but she did not, but the second dose she would, now that she knows and she was comfortable through it. She did have some mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores that came up in Dec2020, but nothing to run to the hospital to the doctor for. Clarifies this occured after she received the vaccine. The outcome of the event allergies, mild eczema flare ups, itchiness and sores were unknown. The outcome of rash at site of injection was recovered on 27Dec2020. The outcome of other events was recovered in Dec2020. The causality between Pfizer COVID vaccine with some swelling of arm, rash developed 5cm x 4cm at injection site, chills and shivers, bronchospasm cough was related (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter, Method of assessment: Global Introspection).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This 60-year-old female nurse (Patient) reported that received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation, Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune. Concomitant medications included Metoprolol at 12.5 mg for Atrial fibrillation and acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN). No diabetes, no hypertension. None of the usual common diseases. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I received vaccine this past Wednesday. I was just talking to a couple of my colleagues and honestly I received the vac. at work. I did not really read through the paperwork and was &#39;weird&#39; sharing reactions to the vaccine which for me was pretty bad reaction and thought like I need to go through your paperwork and report it. So I thought I should call and just give some information. The usual fatigue which I go to after being normal, my arm was not sore. However, as the week progressed into Friday I had a constant headache but it was manageable and then by Friday night my glands swelled, my nerves behind my ears, my neck and I was extremely fatigued, bad headache and went to bed and I had not gone out and finally I got out today I spoke with my Physician yesterday. What happened it looked like an encephalopathy but my head swelled, my face was all swollen, complete brain fog, fatigue and I couldn&#39;t talk. I was in so much pain in my head resulting in (incomplete sentence).&#34; Lab work included the only thing is the PCR swabbing. No blood test. Registered Nurse further stated, &#34;I don&#39;t know if that is important. But I will tell you and if it is you can send me the questions. I do have a history of Autoimmune. So my Physician thought that this was just like an enhancement of like my bodies reaction I have Chronic Lyme and I have lupus like my ANA has always been stressful. But we think that it is a family thing. No treatment for the Lyme. I did a lot of antibiotic and a lot of naturopathic stuff but that is in the past. But anyhow for anything else what I did was when I got the injection they said try and just take Tylenol not Ibuprofen but there was no way I was going to make it through with just that . So I took Ibuprofen. I called my Physician yesterday morning because I was not sure about what was is happening and I thought it might be secondary sinus infection or something else going on and it reassured me that it is definitely due to the vaccine. He said it is just your body&#39;s reaction, take the Ibuprofen, hydrate. Had me take what I had in my house Tigan for nausea. So I was extremely nauseous from the severity of the headache.&#34; Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I just wanted to let you know what happened and the intensity of what it was because normally I would expect a headache. But this was a &#39;go dated&#39;. Registered Nurse stated, &#34;I guess the only question that I have is so do my work has this question and I was going to call my doctor tomorrow may be might know it better. I know that I have to take the second dose. But I understand the second round can be worse than the first. Is there anything that they are recommending that I can do may be prior to ease the reaction?&#34; The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported clinical manifestations including swelling face and head swelled, which was suspected as encephalopathy by the reporting nurse, was probably related to the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine), due to temporal relationship.  The subject&#39;s underlying Chronic Lyme, Lupus and Autoimmune were likely the risk factors to the onset of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At 4hrs post vaccination experienced extreme muscular pain between shoulder blades. The following week, as far as I can recall, I began to have tingling from the right shoulder blade down to my hand. I thought I may have a pinched nerve and went to the walk in clinic to be seen by the nurse practitioner that is in the same office as my primary. She examined me and thought it sounded like a pinched nerve and said I was swollen in the area of complaint. Cervical and thoracic x rays were taken (normal) and was told to take Flexeril and steroids. Pain was getting worse and primary told me to  begin taking  Meloxicam and have physical therapy. I have been doing both beginning 1-11-2021. Pain continues with no  improvement. Do not know if my symptoms are caused from the Covid shot, but just seemed to me that it was quite a coincidence that muscle pain began on the same day as receiving the shot.

The patient had flushing on 05Jan2021, she was hot and turned red like a cherry. She had an episode where she felt really hot like hot flashes or almost like she was flushed. Her face was red as beet and her arm and hands were red, this lasted about an hour and she took ibuprofen (ADVIL) for it. It seemed to be resolved but had come and gone through the night. She was up checking on her puppies so that was how she noticed. She had taken her temperature and it had been 97.6-98.1 which was normal for her, but she was still getting the hot flashes and flushing. She felt feverish and it was not a rash, she just felt flushed. After the vaccine, the patient reported soreness in the arm on 05Jan2021. The patient was experiencing tingling in hands and feet (mostly in feet) on 05Jan2021 and they feel cold. Tingling started about 45 minutes to an hour after the dose.

During this she had checked her pulse ox (oximetry) related to her cold hands and it had been 92-95% (on unknown date) which was good. She had also checked her pedal pulses even though they were cold, and a little they were a little on white side, they blanch although might be a little slow but nothing alarming. The patient had a little headache on 05Jan2021. Other than that, the patient felt fine. No emergency room or physician office visited. No relevant tests. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable.

A 60-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Batch/lot number: EL1283, Expiry Date: 30Nov2021, intramuscularly into right deltoid on 11Jan2021 07:15 at single dose at the hospital for Precaution as frontline healthcare worker. Medical history included Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome from 2000, heart surgery in the past on unknown date, had surgery that was in 2000. Years of chest pain and PVC after that; allergic to Sulfa with hives: One time she mixed it up with a medication of her sons and took it by mistake and did not realize it and she did not have any reaction, she has not had in years. It was an injection and she doesn&#39;t have the name, lot or expiration. Family medical history included Mother was diabetic and sister was prediabetic and was 61. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot E49899) on 18Dec2020 at 10:30 am injected in Right Deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced shivering; same body aches, she took TYLENOL; had major headache all night long, all over her head; It was a pressure headache; Someone gave her MOTRIN and within 3 hours she was totally fine. The patient stated she received the Pfizer COVID vaccine second dose on 11Jan2021 and has had problems since then. She has been miserable, took paracetamol (TYLENOL), headache, have ringing the ears, head was exploding, back aches, calf pain, temperature at 8 am 101.7 and 101.7 at 10:40 on 12Jan2021, feeling very weak, nausea, dry hives, Right upper jaw pain that felt like sinus, all in Jan2021. Her heart rate was in the 130&#39;s at 3:30-4:00 on 12Jan2021 and now down to 115-108. Her Oxygen saturation has been 91-95 %. She just had a miserable night (Jan2021). She had this pressure in her chest. Her heart rate was 130 and O2 was 93%. Her O2 saturation last night (on 11Jan2021) was 91-94%, mostly about 93%. Chest Pressure began around 3am on 12Jan2021. She called healthcare provider and was waiting to get advice from them if she needs an EKG. She was still having a little bit of mild pressure. She noticed that her oxygenation was 93% when this was happening. It went up to 95% for a second last night. Her heart rate was now between 112-115. When she walked, it went to 125-130. It started around 3:30-4:00 this morning (on 12Jan2021) and was mildly improved. she was feeling the chest pressure back pain had lesson, but had pain in the upper jaw, flu like symptoms on 12Jan2021. she said she could not get out of the bed right. She did have a heart surgery in the past, her legs were burring, and week. she said after the first dose she did had a reaction but took MOTRIN and went to work the next day. The patient wanted to know about the heart rate being high and ringing in the ears. She wanted to know if it was supposed to drop your saturation and increase your heart rate. Is she just behaving like the norm or should her O2 be much higher. Her first shot was not as bad as this reaction. There was no prescriber. The temperature just began now as she just took it. Oxygen Saturation dropping began when she woke up in middle of night around 3:30- 4:00. She used her pulse oximeter and noticed it then. It was associated with her ears ringing and her head felt like it would explode at 3:30 on 12Jan2021. She felt better with headache but still had it. She was so weak on 12Jan2021, she did not want to go anywhere. Her oxygenation had worsened to 93% on average. She had a headache last time but did not have ringing in her ears. She woke up about 3:30 with it. The headache now was all over head from front to back and comes and goes. Last time she went to work after receiving the first one and today (on 12Jan2021), there was no way she could go to work. She took TYLENOL when she got home because she was shivering and took more at 3:30 because she felt miserable because of her chest. She took 1 gram. Her headache did not go away. She got to sleep after she took the TYLENOL. Her back and jaw was bothering her. It felt like the flu. She had upper jaw pain and pain in her back. She didn&#39;t have a good back and just aches. After the first one, it took 10 hours for the shivering to start. This time it was very similar. The shivering started about 10 hours later, at 9pm on 11Jan2021. Back pain starting at 05:00 on 12Jan2021 was stated as being sharp on right side scapula and feel like the flu. It is to the right of spinal vertebrae. She thought she would go to bed and lie down. She has had back pain before. The jaw pain started around 05:00 on 12Jan2021. She felt it in her cheek. It was a little bit better. Nausea started at 11:00 pm on 11Jan2021 and got worse at 03:30 when she got up to go to the bathroom around midnight. She felt like she could vomit and felt better, but she couldn&#39;t. Her thighs were burning at 03:30 on 12Jan2020. It was persistent weak and burning. She can barely walk. The areas that have hurt like when you get the flu, she was having now in the same places, so she thought it was from the shot. Calves were sore in back and felt like a DVT (Deep vein thrombosis), started at 03:30 of 12Jan2021 and was still sore. She said she sound like a hypochondriac. It was in back of calf towards knee. She did not think it was a blood clot. It was feeling better. It was still sore but nothing like it was at 03:30. It is just an odd pain.

A contactable Nurse (patient) worked in outpatient mental health reported that a 60-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, Expiry Date: Apr2021) via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at 16:20 in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccine administered at hospital and not military facility. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Medical history included ongoing Graves&#39; disease (the patient had her thyroid irradiated away for Grave&#39;s disease 25 years ago). Family Medical History was none. Concomitant medication included ongoing levothyroxine 1.25 mcg once daily by mouth Graves&#39; disease taking for 25 years. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. The patient received her Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 04Jan2021. Since then she started to experience a genital itch immediately; a rash that was across her body; eyes were swollen and itchy; new itchy rash 13Jan2021. She felt okay going home then she started to have itching around the genital area. She thought she might have a yeast infection but she didn&#39;t have any other symptoms for a yeast infection. Her vulva became swollen from 05Jan2021 and itchy from 04Jan2021 and she noticed rash around her body. It all started in the genital area. The next day the rash spread down her thighs and she noticed an itchy place on her face, but you couldn&#39;t see it. Her thighs were inflamed and she noticed patches of angry whelps on her hips as well as a itchy rash area on her tailbone that seemed more like shingles; size of a quarter; raised, itchy, rash, that felt like it was radiating out. Then she noticed the rash on her face on her cheek, general swelling on her eyes and itching on her eye lids. Now the genital itching was less and most of her symptoms were improved but her eye was driving her crazy and it was more swollen on the outside. She tried to treat her eyes with eye drops Dry Eye Relief (manufacturer Similasan; no UPC seen, lot number: 15942; expiration date: Sep2022, ingredients include Belladonna) but it didn&#39;t help. They were still itchy and weepy. The eye drops were not working. She also treated the rash and itching with Benadryl at night and it improved the symptoms overall. She took Tylenol (UPC 300043760; lot number: PMA003; expiration date: Aug2022) and Bayer Aspirin (81mg; lot number: NAA93E1; expiration date: Feb2023. No UPC code on bottle) every day for general arthritis symptoms, but they didn&#39;t touch her dull headache she has had on and off since the vaccine. Before she got the vaccine, she had a little tag on her vulva, it was tiny. Now after experiencing the itching, swelling, rash on her vulva, the tag was gone. It just took a layer of skin right off. It was not uncomfortable but the whole layer of the skin was gone. It was very uncomfortable while it was happening but now it was okay. When she noticed these symptoms, she tried to call occupational health and a institute but didn&#39;t get anyone. She also contacted her HCP but had not heard back. It seemed to her like a lot of side effects and a lot of itching. She didn&#39;t have it in her throat, but all that itching seems a lot like an anaphylactic reaction. She was curious whether we would recommend her to take the second dose since they say the reaction to the second dose was worse. She had multiple COVID tests that have all come back negative. A friend tested positive so she had a test; and she had a test when she traveled. The events did not require a visit to physician or emergency room. The patient had reactions: itching, rash, swelling, welts, shingle like rash on tailbone, genital area, hips moving to her face, itching and inflammation, in eyes as well. She wanted to know if the 2nd dose was recommended. It was &#34;like an anaphylactic reaction but not in her throat.&#34; itching around the genital area, vulva started from 04Jan2021, vulva was swollen started from 05Jan2021; Rash vulva started from 06Jan2021 to 10Jan2021; rash down her thighs started from 07Jan2021; Raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles started from 06Jan2021, whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy from 07Jan2021; itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see started from 06Jan2021; raised itchy area on her left cheek and eyes started from 07Jan2021; Headache dull started from 06Jan2021. The events Headache dull, itching on her face that she couldn&#39;t see; whelps on her hip, inflamed and itchy and raised itchy rash on the tailbone like shingles were reported as non-serious by the reporter and other events were considered as medical significant by the reporter. Investigation assessment for the events was reported as No. The outcome of the event anaphylactic reaction, inflammation in eye, welts was unknown, outcome of the event Rash vulva was recovered on 10Jan2021; of Headache dull, swelling eye was not recovered, of other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:12 at SINGLE DOSE at right arm for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included SVT this was recognized at least 20 years ago, around the age of 30, she started to deal with high blood pressure, allergic to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took codeine, levothyroxine: allergic to codeine, levothyroxine. The patient also previously took Tylenol with Codeine and that was horrible and she can&#39;t ever take it again, when she was around the age of 40 years old. The patient received the COVID vaccination around Wednesday 30Dec2020 at 12:12 p.m. She was perfectly fine until late Thursday afternoon 31Dec2020, around 3:30-4:00 pm. She started to have swollen lymph nodes. It was only a little bad at first and then she started getting more and more swelling. She spoke with her facility&#39;s RN who suggested she use some cold and warm packs/compresses and also take some Tylenol to deal with it. She has had the swelling for this many days now. It&#39;s not bad swelling but she her lymph nodes are still so swollen. She thought it was a regular reaction, but now it&#39;s been too long. Her lymph nodes are not swollen humongous. There is no redness. Her lymph nodes are not hard, just swollen. The swelling was a little bit better on Friday and Saturday but yesterday, it started bothering her again. She has had pain in her whole arm on an unspecified date. On 03Jan2020, her face also started to feel funny. She clarifies by &#34;feeling funny&#34;, she meant she started to experience numbness in her right cheek, only her cheek, like when one gets a vaccination when they go to a doctor&#39;s office/dentist office and it starts working and one can feel it getting numb. She also experienced numbness in her arm. She clarifies when she puts pressure on her arm (like putting her arm on the desk), she feels numb in her hand. She verifies the numbness in both her cheek and arm started occurring on 03Jan2020 around 7-8pm. She is fine today and then she&#39;ll start to feel the numbness again in her cheek and arm. She clarifies the numbness comes and goes. It comes in the morning and then goes away and then the numbness starts again. She started to feel numb in her face and cheek, like when one gets a Novocain at the dentist office and it starts working- it&#39;s like the same feeling. The outcome of the events Swollen lymph nodes and numbness in right cheek/numbness in arm/hand was not recovered, while unknown for the other event.   Information on the lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                fever; nausea; general feeling of unwell; soreness at site; redness; whole upper arm was swollen after the injection; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient, Respiratory Therapist) reported that a 61-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE , Batch/lot number: EJ1685) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 around 6:00 PM in left upper arm at 0.3mL single dose for COVID Prevention. The patient&#39;s medical history was covid at the end of Apr/May2020 with shortness of breath, seasonal allergies and allergies to &#34;some anitbiotics.&#34; The concomitant medications was reported as none, received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced soreness at site, redness and swelling, fever, nausea, general feeling of unwell 3 days. Patient stated, &#34;I had covid at the end of April/May with shortness of breath. I thought I would have less reaction from the vaccine. I know someone who was out of work for a while week after the vaccine.&#34; States that she read that the 2nd dose is supposed to have worse side effects than the first. If she had bad side effects from the 1st dose, will the 2nd be worse? Also asking if the side effects are the immune system reacting or just an allergic reaction. Patient was anxious about getting her second COVID shot on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that she had all the side effects listed, for three days. Patient stated that she didn&#39;t mind the side effects at the time, she had fever, soreness at the injection site, nausea, and a general feeling of unwell, but Patient stated that she could not work like that. Patient stated that her question was, statistically she has read that the side effects from the second shot are supposed to be worse than the first shot, but she was wondering, if she had bad side effects from the first shot, will her side effects be worse after the second, or will they maybe be lessened because she already had bad side effects. Patient reported that she did fill out the VSafe significant because she had to work on the third day after her shot, which was Christmas Eve, and work, was so busy and she did not feel well. Patient stated that she does have two days scheduled off work after her next injection, but it is the third day that she was worried about because she does not want to work feeling like that. Patient stated that the arm soreness started that same day (21Dec2020). At first, Patient reported that the arm soreness resolved, but then she states that it is still a little sore to the touch. So Patient confirmed that it is ongoing but improved. Patient reportsed that the fever started the day after the injection, 22Dec2020 and it has resolved. Patient reported that the last day she recorded a fever was on 24Dec2020. Patient  stated that she woke up on 24Dec2020 and her temperature was normal, so she went to work and she did not feel so well at work, but they were so busy that she barely noticed, and then when the Patient  went home that night, she took her temperature and it was 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Patient reported that the nausea started on 22Dec2020, which was mild at times, but then she got to where she did not want to eat. Patient reported that the nausea has resolved but she was not entirely sure when it resolved because she had been so busy at work on 24Dec2020, and it was hard to tell what she was feeling because she was non-stop busy that day. Patient stated that she was nauseous for a full three days, and she remembered that she did not eat much on the 24th either. So Patient stated that her nausea may have resolved on the third day after her injection, but it is unknown to her what day exactly that it resolved. Patient was also experiencing the general feeling of unwell from 22Dec2020 for a few days, but stated that by 25Dec2020 she felt okay. Patient also included that her left arm was also swollen, like her whole upper arm was swollen after the injection in Dec2020. Patient stated that she also experienced redness, there was a like a red mark that was further down her arm than the injection site in Dec2020. The outcome of soreness at site was recovering.  Patient confirmed that both the swelling and redness had resolved in Dec2020.The outcome of fever was recovered on 24Dec2020. The outcome of general feeling of unwell and nausea was recovered on 25Dec2020.

I also started feeling lightheaded like I might faint. I pull over into a parking lot and had a family member come get me to drive me home. I was extremely thirsty and drank a lot of water at home. Eventually, my redness went away and my face did not feel as hot.  I did feel other more typical symptoms too such as painful arm, and flu like symptoms. I am mainly concerned about the reaction I had when driving home since it was similar to what happens when I take cortisone or Doxycycline.  I am needing information as to whether it is safe for me to take my second dose of the covid vaccine.

At 1208 on 1/20/2021 pt received 2nd dose of COVID Pfizer vaccine. Immediately after vaccination, pt experienced unusual taste in mouth, flushing, and feeling of heat in chest.  At 1232, pt noticed flushing on arms and feelings of heat and pins and needles in both arms, hands, chest, both feet, and back. Sensation was persistent, so at 1301, 50 mg of IM Benadryl administered to RD by NP. By 1320 flushing on arms and chest subsided, feeling of pins and needles persisted but was not as severe as initial reaction. By 1345 flushing on arms returned, pins and needles sensation worsened again in all locations noted prior, spread to scalp, and tingling sensation occurred on lips. Pt communicated with Dr advised to stay under observation, but transfer to ED not medically necessary. At 1415, pt was advised to go home with supervision of partner and monitor symptoms from there.

I felt a warm sensation after the vaccine in my deltoid muscle then felt it go up both my ears, around my head.  I then felt the same warm sensation in my abdomen, followed by buzzing of my entire body with light headedness.  I could breath, I could talk, but I had an urgency for others around me to know that I wasn?t feeling well and something was not right.  I asked my colleagues if someone could take me to the ER for monitoring.  They immediately put me in a recliner and elevated my legs.  This did not relieve my symptoms and asked to go to the ER.  I got to the ER and laid on the stretcher with continued increased buzzing sensation especially in my finger tips and arms.  My vital signs were 148/88 and HR 88 (elevated from my normal of 100-120/60-70, HR 60s).  The buzzing turned into a sensation in my arms that rumbled erratically.  I thought something bad was about to happen and that my blood cells would burst. Then I also felt icy cold in my arms and my gut.  Next what happened were teeth chattering shivers.  All these symptoms occurred in a matter of minutes.  They started an IV, drew blood, gave me Benadryl and ran IV fluids.  My vitals did not reflect what I felt inside, but as symptoms let up, my VS returned to normal.  As quickly as the symptoms started, they eventually calmed down and I was able to leave the ER in 1.5 hours to go home. I was very scared.  The ER doctor thought I had a hyperimmune response to the vaccine.

                                                After first dose I felt an overall odd feeling .     no shortness of breath etc, just odd.    I was thinking it may have been just some anxiety.  I left the center after 15 minutes and came back to Pediatric office where I work.  I did take a Zyrtec and felt completely better after approx. an hour.  After the 2nd dose I did mention I had felt odd after 1st dose and decided to sit for 30 min.  I felt about the same as I did after the 1st dose so I left.  when  I got to my car my face was flushed.  I was not tachycardia just a very odd felling in my head and then my tongue did start to itch (or feel funny)  .  I took a Zyrtec and went home.  I never had any swelling of lips or tongue, no trouble breathing.  Pulse stayed constant around 80.  This time the symptoms lasted approx. 4 hours.  I I did continue to take Zyrtec for 3 days after injection.

A 61-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had been otherwise well prior to receiving the bnt162b2 on 18Dec2020. Within 72 hours, she experienced fatigue, body aches, chills and sweats since 21Dec2020, though she was able to work Xmas week. On 31Dec2020, she contacted her PCP to report neck and leg muscle stiffness and pain, difficulty ambulating, fatigue, chills and sweats. She had a negative COVID test on 02Jan2021 and essentially negative blood work, other than an ESR of 124 mm/hr and CRP of 4 mg/dl. I had a negative PET scan on 12Jan2021. Currently, she had pain/stiffness in her neck and legs, and progressive difficulty w/ ambulation (both of which are worst in the early hours of the AM), and difficulty with ADLs since 31Dec2020. She had been unable to work since 03Jan2021. Her physician had not indicated or endorsed any relationship between her symptoms and the vax. She forewent dose 2 out of an abundance of caution. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. No treatment received. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No medications received within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The events muscle stiffness , neck pain and gait disturbance appeared 13 days after administration of single dose BNT162B2. The Company considers that the events are less likely related to suspect BNT162B2 injection given the weak time association. The detailed clinical course and cause of the events would be helpful for further assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90&#39;s with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient&#39;s white blood cell count is 11.07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and then VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate. Therefore discussion with sister at bedside resulted in decision for cessation of life support. Patient expired shortly after support withdrawn and pronounced dead on 2/15/2021 at 11:11 AM.

A 61-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (, Solution for injection, Batch/lot no: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:00 in the left arm at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously did get a flu shot in Nov or Dec2020. The patient developed a bad rash, hives, all over her body and itching on 10Feb2021. She reports, her feet were incredibly hot over the next 3 days on 07Feb2021. What started off as a few bumps kept increasing up to 3 days later. She was unable to sleep from being so itchy. Her doctor said it was an allergic reaction and prescribed an antihistamine after which it left in Feb2021. She was due for the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 25Feb2021. The patient did not had any investigation assessment. The patient states that there was little information out there to compare the experience she had. Wanted to call to make Pfizer aware of that and maybe get some more information out there. Has printed out the fact sheet and assumes she should not get the second vaccine because of what happened the first time. Wants to clarify what happened and share with Pfizer this information since she can&#39;t find much information for people who have had a delayed reaction. Went to get the vaccine on 04Feb and doesn&#39;t consider herself an allergic type person. Has no allergy to foods, medicines, only gets poison ivy and bug bites like most people. By Monday, the 4th day (08Feb2021) after getting the vaccine, noticed a couple of bumps on the wrist and does not know where else and didn&#39;t think of it as anything else. Thought it was a bite or she touched a plant and then it went away. It was not much. In the evening of Tuesday she had a bad reaction and on the 10th (10Feb2021) she had rash, hives, and itching that just moved to different places over the body. Her feet were so hot on the 3rd day and had to plunged them into cold water and used Epsom salt off and on and it helped some. This happened only for 2 nights and the reason she didn&#39;t go to the doctor, it went away. Again, mentions the first night she had a couple bumps and didn&#39;t think much about it. The second night, it was all over her body, the rash, and she took Epsom baths that helped, but she didn&#39;t get much more than an hour of sleep. She tried to take pictures of her thighs and backside, but unable to take good pictures, not a selfie person. The next morning she had her husband take pictures in case it went away and she went to the doctor they would have pictures to show. Her husband thought it may be shingles. Called the doctor on Thursday and had pictures to show her since the rash went away. Again, mentions the reaction was so bad on Wednesday. The doctor didn&#39;t believe areas on pictures of her back were shingles since shingles does not come and go away like that and that she must have had an allergic reaction to something. Provider didn&#39;t believe it was from the vaccine. Was given a prescription for Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg and was informed if areas didn&#39;t improve or returned she may need to see an allergist or immunologist. After the appointment she didn&#39;t get much sleep and woke up at 4pm in the afternoon and felt a little off, it could have been in her head or maybe she was paranoid, but she wasn&#39;t going to wait for the reaction to be full blown over her body and took one Hydroxyzine HCL and went to bed at 7:30pm and didn&#39;t do anything since. Got up and the reaction/rash, hives, itching was all gone after taking only one. It&#39;s like an antihistamine or Zyrtec. No further details provided. Later mentions after getting the first vaccine on the 4th, the next day she had arm soreness up until that Monday when the rash started. No further details provided. Says as far as recommendations were concerned for the paper she printed, the fact sheet. It says pretty much listed, she shouldn&#39;t have the second dose if difficulty breathing, swelling in the face and throat. The only thing she had was the rash on the neck, not the face. Paperwork also lists heart beating fast, or severe allergic reaction. The patient had no emergency room visit. The patient visited the physician office. The outcome of the event hot feeling in feet was recovered on feb2021 and rest of the events was recovering.

A 62-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm, on 28Dec2020 at 14:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included environmental allergies, she has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume, blood pressure (abnormal) and sleep (disorder). Concomitant medications included ongoing lisinopril for blood pressure, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously took novocaine but was allergic.  She got all this information when she got the vaccine on Monday at (place name) in (state name). It tells all the side effects from the first injection. She wanted to report that it is the same arm that she got the vaccine in. She has swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm.  It says you can have joint pain, but nothing about swelling. She thought she better report it. This was her first shot. She is supposed to get the second one on 18Jan2021. She wanted to make sure she can take it. She received the vaccine on 28Dec2020. She laid around that day. Today is the first day she doesn&#39;t have arm pain and swelling at the injection site.  It was the first time she has had arm pain. She has never had that with flu shot. The arm pain started within the 15 minutes she was observed. It hurt like hell until that day. She got a bruise at the injection site. It bled a little bit when she put it in. Swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm: she doesn&#39;t know if it was later that day. She can&#39;t remember. She really noticed it yesterday. She has never had joint pain or swelling. She doesn&#39;t have any problems with arthritis. Now her little finger is bigger than the rest of her fingers. It hurts because of the swelling. She doesn&#39;t want to take anything. It might be fluid. She has a high pain tolerance. She keeps bending it thinking it will get better. It isn&#39;t as bad, but its still swelled up. At first she thought it was better, but it is still pretty swollen. To her this is a reaction. She was thinking if she took paracetamol before, it wouldn&#39;t hurt as bad, but she can&#39;t remember if she took it that morning. She takes 500mg before bed for the heck of it at night. It helps her sleep better. She has allergies and can have an asthmatic attack from cat dander and perfume. They think she was allergic to the preservative in the flu shot, but she has never had any trouble with the flu shot since. She has environmental allergies. They thought she was allergic to Novocaine once at the dentist office. Who knows, it only happened once. She&#39;s been to the dentist many times and who knows what they injected and why she reacted that way. She felt like she was going to pass out. They don&#39;t give it to her anymore. She doesn&#39;t know what was in it. She is worried since this vaccine is emergency authorization. She doesn&#39;t want to get the next one and have a worse reaction. She is not sure if she should be worried. The events of swelling and joint pain in the little finger on left arm were assessed as medically significant. Outcome of the event of &#39;swelling of fingers&#39; was not recovered, the other events were unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event joint pain was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile. Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the event swelling with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                10:23pm felt a slight headache and nausea.  Left work at 10:43pm since didn&#39;t feel good.  While on road, my tongue started to tingle and then my lips started to tingle and both sides of face felt numb. This started around 10:50pm?  Went to bed and woke up Sat with same tongue, lip tingleling and face numbness.  Lips felt very swollen. Felt that way throughout the weekend.  On Monday, went back to work place injection area and requested someone talk to me.  Nurse practioner came out and spoke to me, asked about balance of facial features, no problem breathing or swallowing and gave me 25mg benadryl to take 3 times a day.  Did nothing but make me sleepy.  She calls me Tue am and told me to make an appt with PCP.  Made phone appt  for Wed.  Dr calls me Wed am and gives me presciption for 60mg Prednisone to take for a week (at this time symptoms are the same).  the first 3 days taking Prednisone the intensity of tingleling seems to lessen day by day.  But on 4th day, the symptoms stopped lessening.  Finished the meds anyway. Last 3 days, i&#39;ve also had that mild headache back in addition to the numbness from face traveling up to my ears. Past few days the tingling in tongue isn&#39;t confined to just the edges of the tongue.  It started with the first 1/4 of whole  tongue and is today tingleling in the front half of whole tongue.  One good thing so far is the past few days, my lips feel way less swollen and tingleling is lessening. So, riding this out, hoping it will  end sometime this year.  Will not be getting the second shot.  Just so you know.

Finally on Thursday night I realized maybe it is the shot that is giving me all the itching. My whole body was flushed I kept scratching my arms and legs, especially  around my ankle, knee, under arm and goin area.  I took an allergy pill  and called Kaiser and spoke with an advice nurse. she   mentioned that taking an allergy pill will relief some of the itching.   I fell asleep around after midnight normally I go to bed around 9:30.  I also called pfizer and explained and the person took all my information and symptoms.

                                                A little over 12 hours after receiving my 2nd dose at 8:42 am, I woke up at approximately 11:15 pm to find that my tongue and throat were swelling. I immediately took 1 25mg benadryl and went to the Emergency Room (ER). After many questions and examination of my mouth. I was given another benadryl, prednisone, and famotidine. I waited and was observed for approximately 2.5 hours in the ER. At that time it was obvious that the medication was effective and I was comfortable leaving the ER to return home. I had prescriptions for more prednisone and famotidine to take for 5 days. On Wednesday, I felt well enough to go to work at my school, though I did light duty. On Thursday, I was also at school and also attended a physical therapy session and exercise class. I talked at length with my PT about my experience and she could tell that I was feeling good (presumably from the prednisone) and cautioned me about not overdoing things during exercise. I felt like my tongue was beginning to swell and the PT mentioned that my words sounded a bit funny (she was the only one to comment on this). I then went to dinner at my daughters house and began to feel tired from the benadryl. Upon arriving home and getting ready for bed, my husband and I both noticed how flushed my chest and face had become during the day. My throat and tongue were still somewhat swollen and my throat was beginning to hurt. During the day on Thursday, I had registered with the local  Covid information website and had received an email stating that I should feel free to call the triage phone number if I needed. At approximately 9:45 pm I called and talked with a nurse who urged me to return to the ER because of the flushing and continued swelling. In the ER I was seen by a different doctor who was concerned not so much about the swelling, but about the white streaks in my throat and had me swabbed for strep throat. That test was negative. He said he had read my chart from Tuesday night and felt that the medication that had been prescribed was appropriate and that he didn&#39;t feel anything needed to be changed. He asked about how bad my throat felt and wrote a prescription for Magic Mouthwash and I asked for an EpiPen, which he also prescribed. We arrived home at approximately 12:00 am, but it was still difficult to lie down and sleep. I had already decided that I would not go to school on Friday and stay home and rest. I needed to pick up my prescriptions when the pharmacy opened and I ran a few other errands while I was out, but returned home and slept most of the afternoon. I have not been very energetic this evening, but decided that I wanted to get this form filled out. At approximately 10:00 PM on Friday evening, I hope that I am able to sleep better than I have the last several nights.

This 62 years old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL3246) on 19Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 62 years old), in left arm, for COVID-19 immunisation. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) or on the same day: none. Medical history included ongoing trigeminal neuralgia (she had nerve issues, clarifying she was diagnosed about 6-1/2 years ago with trigeminal neuralgia that caused right-sided pain in her head and in her right ear), Raynaud&#39;s in her hands and feet since she was a kid. The patient previously took a 7-day course of levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and after that she had a diagnosis of ongoing erythromelalgia in her hands and feet and permanent ringing in ears, both since 2014, after she took, saying she functioned fine with the permanent ringing in her ears, she had gotten used it. She also felt horrible and had a muscle tear in her right arm a week after taking Levaquin. Concomitant medication included nortriptyline 20 mg capsule once daily (at night), ongoing since about 6-1/2 years ago, for trigeminal neuralgia. On 19Jan2021, 3 hours after vaccination, the patient experienced itching on the left side of her tongue. On the same day she had a little bit of swelling on the left side of her tongue. She took 1 generic 25 mg tablet of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) at 19:30 and was okay and slept fine. The next day it felt different but it wasn&#39;t itching. She had other autoimmune type things going on. Since an unspecified date in Feb2021 the patient had been having more ear pain and usually took medicine for this but had not had ear pain in awhile. The patient said the left side of her tongue itching and swelling was enough to make her concerned. She also said she was concerned that there may be something in the COVID-19 vaccine that will activate her nerve issue since her right ear had been hurting her since Feb2021. She said she thought that maybe the cold weather was causing her right ear pain, but she had been on medication for over 6 years now that had been taking care of her right ear pain. She said she did not want to have the second COVID-19 vaccine injection if it was going to set off her nerve issue. She stated the doctors were thinking that she should get it but staying there and be monitored and not get it on her day off. She would be getting it at the student health center where she worked so she could be monitored and would have access to medical treatment if needed. Relevant tests: none. The events did not require ER visit or physician office visit. Itching on the left side of her tongue resolved on 19Feb2021. Swelling of tongue resolved on 20Feb2021. The other events outcome was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of  autoimmune disorder and other events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including autoimmune panel, ANA and ESR, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                cellulitis; lymphadenitis; Fever 103; Still swollen from groin area down to knee; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). This 62-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 26Feb2021 at 12:00 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history was unknown. Concomitant medications were none. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks or other medications in two weeks. The patient experienced fever 103 white posture on knee that turned into cellulitis and lymphadenitis. The patient had IV antibiotics twice within 5 days of vaccine as treatment for events. The patient still had swollen from groin area down to knee. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had no covid prior vaccination, no covid tested post vaccination. Outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event cellulitis is assessed as unrelated to BNT162B2 based on the information provided. The event onset date is not reported, therefore the drug-event temporal relationship is not clear. In addition, the BNT162B2 vaccine was administered in the arm but the reported cellulitis was at knee area. It is very unlikely that the cellulitis was related to BNT162B2.

She treated it with Tylenol.  She said that she did not feel real good most of the day on Saturday 19Dec2020, but by Sunday she was back to normal again. The outcome of the event Urinary tract infection was unknown while the outcome of  the other events was resolved on 20Dec2020.

Upon waking I felt ok but after walk; weakness; felt very poorly; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health care professional. A 63-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection; Lot number: EL1284), intramuscular on 04Jan2021 11:45 at single dose at left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypothyroidism, psoriasis. Concomitant medications included etanercept (ENBREL), and levothyroxine. The patient felt okay right after the injection but about 2 hours later, on 04Jan2021 14:30, she started experiencing a pressure headache, gradually felt very poorly and took a nap for a few hours. Upon waking the patient felt okay but after walking around the house for about 20 minutes, the headache started up again and the same awful feeling of weakness so she laid down and took another 2 hours nap. When the patient woke up the second time she felt as though nothing had happened, was feeling fine. So the patient would say the side effects lasted for about 5 hours. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Jan2021 17:00.

                                                On Friday, January 15 at approximately 6 PM while seated in a reclining chair watching television I started to develop hives below my right gluteal fold. Over the next six hours  approximately 300 hives appeared on my skin. They were very itchy. At approximately midnight my lip began to swell and being a certified registered nurse anesthetist,  who lives alone, I knew it was time to head to the ER. Prior to going to the ER  I  cleaned the lesions With alcohol, took prednisone 10 mg PO,  and applied hydrocortisone cream.    In the ER, I was given Benadryl 50 mg PO and Pepcid 20 mg and observed for one hour. The hives remained but there was no respiratory compromise. Approximately six hours later the hives were still increasing in size and number, were unbearably itchy and my swollen lips had not subsided.  I took Claritin 10 mg PO and returned to the same ER and was given Epinephrine 0.3 mg IM, prednisone 20 mg po and observed for three hours. The hives did not decrease and again there was no respiratory compromise so I was sent home on prednisone And a H-1 blocker.  Of note, both my palms and lips have been bright cherry red.     I finished a five day course of Macrobid on January 13 at 10 AM.    Final diagnosis:  Alergic  reaction

                                                Bell&#39;s Palsy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 63-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: ELD14D, via an unspecified route of administration, in left side of arm, on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included early breast cancer from 2017 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included tamoxifen citrate 20 mg tablet by mouth once daily from 2017 and ongoing for breast cancer (cancer pill, she has to be on it for 5 years). The patient received the vaccine as she is &#34;with fire department, thought she needed to take it, she had early breast cancer, is around lots of people&#34;. On 09Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsy, assessed as medically significant and in Jan2021 she experienced earache (she thought it was an earache, but it was more than that, but it made her ear hurt, and she has no infection), her mouth was drawled a little, further detailed as numbness and &#34;the eye, it is messing with it, when she is trying to see out of it, she can see, but it&#39;s blurry like&#34; and, &#34;where the ear thing is&#34;, on the back of the lymph node was real sore and her face was kind of puffy, which is the reason she went to the doctor. The patient had to go to her doctor, he told her she had a reaction to the shot, he called it Bell&#39;s Palsy, and said to let Pfizer know. Her doctor gave her something to take for mouth drawled/numbness, which is supposed to help, and she has to go back in a week. The event Bell&#39;s palsy outcome was unknown at the time of the report.

Chills on Friday morning in the middle of night; woke up and my temp was 101.3 and I was feeling bad all day; had headache and went back to bed. Still have pain in hip/knee and joints and those pains got really bad after the vaccine - increased. Doctor  vist told me to use Ibuprofen to 3 times a day for that pain.  Shortness of breath continues from Covid symptoms and so does the hip/joint pain - it has decreased.

I asked a coworker because my chest felt like I had heartburn. It was really bad. Protonic - a coworker gave it to me to see if that would help. And I took it. Diaphoretic - sweating - coworker noticed that I was sweating. I had pain in my jaw. I thought I was showing signs of a heart attack. A doctor came over and we told her what was happening with me. He recommended that I should be seen right away. Next thing I know, nurse is wheeling me down to ER in wheelchair as my chest pains weren&#39;t going away but ER told me I had to go through triage and wait. Finally got seen and I had an EKG - which was good. CDU unit - was admitted to and checked Troponin levels and did blood work.  Everything came back fine. My EKG was being monitored all night. At one point I was feeling something and they gave me a dose of Nitro. It gave me a headache. There all night and then I did a stress test in the morning. And I was released that day. That was my day off so I was off all work. I went back to the work the day after. My granddaughter came to stay with me over Christmas and she started having symptoms of COVID.  She wasn&#39;t feeling well. /She tested positive.Symptoms for COVID began for me on December 26th and was tested for COVID on December 27th - cough; sore throat; headache, fever, not got chills or lose my taste or smell (until after those symptoms were finished); belching - lots; diarrhea; upset; nausea. Extremely tired and muscles aches, joint pain - settled in my lower back and my hip. I still struggle with those joint pain and tiredness today. They put me off work until January 12 2021. I was scheduled to get the dose 2 at 9th but didn&#39;t get it that day because of COVID illness.

                                                Patient received her vaccine on Thursday, 1/21/21.  From then until Saturday afternoon she had been experiencing extreme fatigue.  On Sat. around 5:00 PM she was standing at her flat-top stove cooking dinner.   A wave of very extreme fatigue came over her, so she leaned over to turn off the burner.  When she did this, she passed out leaning forward with her hand on the burner and touching the frying pan.  When she came to, she went to the couch and laid down - not realizing for 10 minutes that her hand and right breast were burned.   The resulting injuries lead to her having to see her PCP on Monday, and then a General Surgeon on Weds 1/27/21.   Injuries sustained include a second degree burn on her right breast, On the right arm, laterally above the wrist is a small superficial partially healed burn.  On the dorsal aspect of the right fifth finger there is a longitudinal burn that goes from the MCP joint to almost the tip of the finger.  She has limited range of motion due to discomfort and swelling.  The blister encompasses the entire dorsal lateral aspect of the finger. The fourth right finger has a less extensive blistered area on the PIP joint.   The burn on the fifth finger is  deep second degree.

A 63-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 14Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Vaccination was done in a hospital. Medical history included HTN, GERD, constipation, ocular migraine, osteoarthritis in sacroiliac joints, small fiber neuropathy, glucose intolerance, steatotic liver, CTS (Carpal tunnel syndrome). Concomitant medication included losartan (LOSARTAN), furosemide sodium (LASIX [FUROSEMIDE SODIUM]), and spironolactone (SPIRONOL).

We went to a pharmacy immediately and got some Bennedryl which took the symptoms away within the hour.

                                                Pt complained of throat tightness and being lightheaded beginning at 1127 hours (5 minutes after vaccine).  She arrived at emergency/symptoms reporting station at 1129 hours.  She denied tongue swelling, denied rash, denied difficulty speaking.  No rash was seen by medics either.  Pt did not have wheezing or stridor.  Medics on scene and student medics under the direction of Medics, placed the patient on the monitor.  Her HR was stable in the 70s and her sats were 99-100% on room air, with a strong pulse and RR of 16.  The pt became more anxious and demanded that someone assist her with her Epi pen administration. RN explained sxs of anxiety and sxs of anaphylaxis.  Pt became agitated and again remained adamant that medics give her Epi.  At 1132 hours a student medic under the direction of Medics administered the pts own epi pen to her.  Vitals signs after epi were HR of 88, BP of 170/97, RR 22, sats 100% .  A transport unit was called as precaution and to potentially transport.  Pt appeared to have an increase in agitation as indicated by her speech with medics being short and her stating that she was &#34;irritated&#34; with &#34;everyone talking&#34;, that she &#34;can&#39;t hear everyone all at the same time&#34;, that this is just &#34;too much&#34; and waving her hands in the air.  Pt was transported to the ER via Medics for continued care and follow up.

                                                soreness to arm injection site; might have lymph node swelling or something; a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear; sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes; the first dose on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM/ second dose on 06Jan2021 13:00; the first dose on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM/ second dose on 06Jan2021 13:00; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer for self. This 64-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 06Jan2021 13:00 on left arm at single dose (Lot # EL1284) for COVID prevention. Medical history included ongoing arthritis in some form probably since 2011 (reported as ten years ago, as of 07Jan2021), ongoing Osteoporosis had it probably at least since five years ago, maybe longer, ongoing Barrett&#39;s esophagus had it probably since 2016 (reported as five years ago, as of 07Jan2021) High cholesterol this is managed or lowered with medication, and was diagnosed in 2001 (reported as probably 20 years ago, as  of 07Jan2021) her whole family has it. Concomitant medications were none. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM at age of 64-year-old on right arm at single dose (Lot # EL0140) for COVID prevention. She says that the first time she got the injection in her right arm, but the second time her right arm was still hurting, which she has arthritis over there also, this time she got the injection in her left arm. She says that the soreness or sharp pain under her left ear could be or not be related. She experienced soreness to arm injection site. She says that the area below her left ear doesn&#39;t feel swollen, it just feels like not a sore throat, but every so often she has a sharp pain, and it could be that she slept on it wrong. She says she was wondering if that goes away fast or is connected, like a possible side effect. The patient received the 2nd dose of the vaccine 06Jan2020 13:00 and reported to have a sharp pain/soreness right below her left ear on 07Jan2021, sharp pain below left ear that comes and goes. She read that swollen lymph nodes were a side effect and is asking if that area is a lymph node and would that be considered a side effect and is asking how long it will it take before it goes away. She is wondering since side effects said might have lymph node swelling or something. She says in her arm where her shot was given is sore, and also kind of right below her left ear, which she thinks that is where a lymph node is. She says every so often she has a sharp pain there that goes away, and she wanted to know if this could be a part of it, since she is guessing that is where a lymph node is, or wondering it this is something even related that could be a side effect. Treatment included she took Tylenol Rapid Relief Extra Strength a while ago, dose queried but not provided. EXP: Jul2022, LOT: SJA072, this is not on the bottle, it must have been on an outer box which was discarded. Treatments received for the events pain, pain in ear, vaccination site pain and swollen lymph nodes. Outcome of the events were unknown.

A 64-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EJ1685), via intramuscular on 28Dec2020 07:15 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included hepatitis C which cleared in 2016, hysterectomy was done in 2004 or 2005, cyst removed from breast long ago, ongoing arthritis in left knee, urinary tract infection was treated in Nov2020. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She received the first vaccine on 28Dec2020. She did fine that day. She came home and laid down and rested. Her temperature went up to 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit but was resolved that same day/night. Early in the morning on 29Dec2020, around 3:30 a.m., she woke up and had a racing/pounding feeling in her chest. She took her blood pressure and it was 158/86, heart rate (HR) was 83. She felt really funny. She hadn&#39;t been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, so this was high for her. She took her blood pressure again about an hour later and it was 165/95, HR 73. She took it again about an hour later and her blood pressure read 180/98, HR 77. Her heart rate stayed in the normal range, but the force felt really strong. She did go to the emergency room around 5:00 am on 29Dec2020. She told them what she was experiencing and that she had received the COVID-19 vaccine. About the time she got to the hospital, her blood pressure was starting to come down. An EKG was done and they drew bloodwork. Her potassium came back a little low-they didn&#39;t tell her how low or what her level was. She was given 2 potassium tablets which did help. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the potassium she was given. It was given to her at the hospital. She was also given a sheet to monitor her salt intake, which she already does that. She confirmed she was not admitted into the hospital, she was discharged from the Emergency Room. She felt pretty good. She didn&#39;t go to work that Wednesday, 30Dec2020, but she went to work on Thursday, 31Dec2020. On 01Jan2021, the same thing happened to her again. She had elevated blood pressure, forceful beat. She went back to the ER early in the morning, around 5:00 am, on 01Jan2021. Her pulse stayed within normal range, but she had such a forceful beat. She informed them that she was really uncomfortable in her chest, the force was the most uncomfortable at this point. They wanted to make sure she wasn&#39;t have a stroke or heart attack, so they did their normal procedures to rule this out. They did 2 EKG&#39;s, 2 sets of labs, Chest X-ray, CAT scan and everything came back normal. She had a discussion with the physician that saw her about what she was experiencing and the physician was asking her about having anxiety. Caller explains she has never really had problems with anxiety before, but she can&#39;t say she hasn&#39;t had it. Being around COVID patients and getting the shot, sometimes anxiety can be there. The physician wanted her to try a low dose of Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg. She was to only to take a half dose by mouth, if her top number (systolic blood pressure) was between 140-160. Caller clarifies when she means half of a dose, the dose equals 12.5mg. She was instructed to take this 12.5mg dose until she saw her PCP. So, she did this and called her PCP and wasn&#39;t able to get an appointment to speak with a provider until the following Wednesday, 06Jan2021. She did a tele visit with her provider and let her know what had happened and that the half of the pill will only bring her top number (systolic blood pressure) to 130&#39;s-140&#39;s. Caller states she was used to her top number (systolic) being maybe in the 120&#39;s, low 130&#39;s. Her doctor increased her dose to 25mg. She was prescribed to take 25mg, tablet, by mouth, once a day. She confirmed she still checks her blood pressure before she takes the medicine. Caller verifies she has 2 bottles, one being the 12.5mg dose and the second being the 25mg dose. With the 12.5mg bottle, she sees refills and the date 05Jan2022. Caller clarifies both bottles are dispensed in pharmacy vials with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date. About a month prior to all of this and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, clarified as Nov2020, she was treated for a UTI. During that time, her blood pressure went up a little and kind of bounced around a little bit, but came back down. Then, she got the COVID-19 shot. She initially felt fine but later on by the time she got a chance to do the tele visit with her PCP, she was telling her about her previous UTI, and the provider put her on Cipro because it seemed like her UTI symptoms were coming back. Caller verifies she doesn&#39;t have any NDC, Lot number or expiration for the Cipro. She already took of all of that. She went to the ER for the third time on 08Jan2021 because she again felt the forceful beat feeling in her chest. She explained she felt really wiped out and worn down and she was tired. An EKG was done and they did labs. She confirms she doesn&#39;t have any results with her at this time. She was taken off of work for a couple of weeks. She is currently getting in contact with a Cardiologist to make sure everything is alright. The cardiologist wants her to have a stress test. The caller states so this is where she is now. She is taking blood pressure medicine and getting set up to do a stress test. Sore arm outcome: Caller confirms she recovered from the arm soreness within that same day. Her arm didn&#39;t stay sore long at all. Racing/pounding in chest: This had improved. It&#39;s not like it was. She still has it a little bit of it now, but she is going to see her cardiologist and do a stress test. The blood pressure medicine has helped some. Elevated blood pressure: Today her blood pressure top number got to 161 and she had to take medication but her blood pressure has improved. Outcome of elevated blood pressure, racing/ pounding in chest was resolving; outcome of forceful beat feeling in her chest, UTI, potassium was a little low, felt really wiped out and worn down/tired, anxiety was unknown; outcome of arm a little bit sore, 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit fever was resolved on 28Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

Currently there was still soreness with the lymph nodes but she would have to press to feel it, she would say that was over. She has a picture if needed of the red splotches. Patient stated that she is healthy for her age. She has no medical conditions or takes no medications. The events did not require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office.

A 64-year-old female patient (not pregnant) received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EL3249), intramuscular on left arm on 16Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included HTN (hypertension), mopericarditis, anxiety and allergy to antihistamine tabs. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, the patient was experiencing chest tightness, SOB (shortness of breath), and dizziness on 16Jan2021. 50 mg of Benadryl and 20 mg of famotidine was administered around 14:10. Patient was still experiencing chest tightness and was having difficulty breathing. 0.3 mg of epinephrine was administered at 14:20. EMS was called. Breathing improved. Pulse Ox 100%, HR (heart rate): 68, blood pressure (BP) increased for 130/89. EMS arrived and assumed patient care. ED COURSE: Patient was seen and examined with doctor. Patient developed of SOB, dizziness, wheezing after receiving first shot of Pfizer COVID vaccine. She received Benadryl upon development of symptoms, which actually made them worse given her allergy to antihistamine tabs, but her symptoms improved upon administration of 0.3 IM epinephrine shot. Differential diagnoses include but were not limited to anaphylaxis, anxiety attack, medication-induced allergic reaction on 16Jan2021. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was unknown whether the patient received any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient visited emergency room/ department or urgent care due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. It was unknown whether the patient has been tested for COVID-19, since the vaccination. The events were assessed as non-serious by the reporter. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events. The outcome of the events was reported as recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided and temporal relationship, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded. The treatment with Benadryl  most likely contributed to the events as the patient is known allergic to antihistamine tabs. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Then I passed out, I fell down and hit my face on the floor.  My family called 911 paramedica.  They ,measured d my blood pressure and it was too low. The area around my right eyebrow was swollen and my neck hurt as precaution I went to the hospital.  I suspect the incident and its symptom are side effects of the vaccine given the timing.  Later on I had headache off and on and brain fog.

You want me to break it down like what the time and what the affect was? Okay 11 PM on Friday 18th my hands swelled up, they were red and they were itchy. I couldn&#39;t get the itching to stop. Hand cream or cold water they finally subsided with cold water and I was able to get sleep. Then I woke up Saturday, 19Dec2020 at 6 AM then was my hands, my feet swollen, red and itchy. Itching was just like, I did not know what to do about it. Used cold water and that rested for about 4 hours. After that stopped I had a rash on my arms, my leg and my abdomen and it just came out of nowhere. It was red like a bubbly rash like a size of pea. You think I looked at I thought what I was going to do. I went I got a cool shower another 4 hours that subsided not completely but enough where it wasn&#39;t scary anymore, it was bearable. Closer to dinner time I had Lymphadenopathy under both arms, red, swollen then I took another 4 to 5 hours to subside. During this I have sore arm that was slightly swollen. The arm was swollen, the shoulder was swollen and the clavicle area was also swollen and that&#39;s my reaction. I work in healthcare and I was just at a point I went to work, I reported the incident and I filed a VARIS report. I talked to my administrator she said I should call Pfizer, let them know. I spoke to my primary doctor, to let him know. I just wanted to report this to someone.&#34;Registered Nurse stated, &#34;My work place.

                                                When I signed up for the vaccine, the website said that i was at high risk for the vaccine and would need to wait 15-30 minutes after the injection.  I checked with doctor re: this warning and she felt the vaccine was still beneficial but to do my research and make a decision. I received the vaccine at the Center.  I sat down as instructed. 5 minutes later, something felt off and I removed my protective visor.  A paramedic came over about a minute later and asked if i was ok.  I said that i didn&#39;t feel well.  He said that he was going to get a chair with wheels for me and at that time i must have passed out.  The next thing that i remember was waking up laying on the floor. My husband said that there were 4 paramedics in attendance.  The primary paramedic was telling me that my BP was 72/60.  An ekg was being run, an iv inserted and run full force.  they checked my blood sugar which was fine. The primary paramedic kept talking to me to check my level of consciousness.   I was there for quite a while. Not sure who the paramedics checked with, but they decided that i needed to go via ambulance to the hospital. The paramedics were very concerned that the ambulance go to the back door to pick me up so others getting the vaccine would not be frightened. I was transported to Medical Center for further evaluation. I was there for a few hours and my labwork was normal. EKG and chest xray were completed as well as cardiac monitoring.  I called doctor&#39;s office the next morning to notify her of the event. It was very scary!!!

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Patient age at time of vaccination was 65 years. The patient did not have reactions with other immunizations except a severe reaction with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine when she was younger. She had seizures after receiving the MMR vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient mentioned she had a severe reaction. She described her adverse reaction by having intense headaches, having stroke-like symptoms in which she described as she cannot speak, having headaches, having numbness in her hands, face, and lips. She also felt exhausted. She also had some pain in her arm that she is not concerned about. She mentioned that she also has her vision affected, she couldn&#39;t drive, there were wavy lines all though her eyes. She started to have hallucinations such as seeing people that weren&#39;t there, seeing snow storms, and seeing things whipping throughout the wind. All the events started on 04Jan2021. She reported she was very sick in the hospital and is now getting well. However it was unknown if she was admitted to hospital (clarification pending). She wanted to know recommendations about the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine because with her experience, she is not comfortable having the second shot of the COVID-19 vaccine.   Information about lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be excluded.

This consumer reported similar events in two patients. This is the first of two reports.  A 65-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number and expiry date: not reported), intramuscular on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma. Concomitant medication included vitamins nos. It was reported that both the patient and her husband received the Pfizer Vaccine on 10Jan2021; and they had reaction to it. They both both had bad arm swelling and pain. Her was worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm. At first, they just thought it was a reaction as they read reactions could be and then she started to get small cough but by Friday, her husband went and got tested and on Wednesday he was tested positive and this is after the vaccine and then he got the results and it said he was positive. So, Saturday, they both went and got tested, they did the rapid and they did what they call the PCR, and they both came positive for both of them and this was after they receive the first vaccine. So, she thought they need to know that they got sick and it was after the vaccine. The patient needed to ask a question as they were supposed to go for their second vaccine on 31Jan2021 and do they do it even though they got sick. They knew they were claiming that they can&#39;t get sick because of the vaccine but it&#39;s very ironic that they did get this. They had been following CBC guidelines, both her husband and the patient because they are older and they wear mask all the time and they did everything they needed to and they could not understand how they got this. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Rapid and PCR: positive in Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of &#34;bad arm swelling and pain; worst she couldn&#39;t even lift or move her arm&#34; which included treatment with Tylenol. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021092094 same reporter and drug, similar events in a different patient

                                                Feeling mostly normal but tired fell asleep at 11PM day of second vaccine.  Woke up 1 hour later and got up to go to the bathroom but felt fine.  Went out to the hall bathroom so as not to wake husband in Master bath.   Urinited and  got up slowly as I always do and walked out to the hallway to go back to bed.   I lost consciousness and came to when my husband who heard a thud came and found me out having fallen down the stairs.. head on the landing and feet above the landing.  I have no recollection of it  once leaving the bathroom and i would have headed away from the stairs which was just to the left of the bathroom doorway.   I didn&#39;t feel any pain.  Later found a bump on my forehead of the right side of my face and a bruised lip. He said my back was wet  with sweat and I took a couple minutes to come to.  After returning to the bed.. i immediately had to empty bowels. Diarrhea.. then the rest of the night in Chills.  No fever.  Slept most of the next day and night.   Headache and joint aches and swelled lymph nodes in neck..  Fatigue through 20th.  Mostly better by the 21st.  Still today on 22 I am being careful when going from  prone to standing.  I feel more head pressure getting up and maybe I notice a little  nausea  when rising.  I may just be worried about fainting again.  It has never happened to me before.  I do have very good blood pressure on the lower side so I was always careful to get up slowly but never fainted.  Neck is sore.. Not sure if lymph nodes or something to do with fall.

                                                I had injection site discomfort, about 4-6 hours after vaccination. I  had generalized aching over all my body (joint/muscle pain) that started about 10 PM the night. I woke up Saturday morning with a bad headache, felt like I was pass out, I had chills. Saturday afternoon I noticed under right armpit the lymph nodes were swollen. The pain radiates throughout my chest and shoulder but most severe under the armpit. As of today 22nd I feel tired and I am still experiencing the swollen lymph nodes under my right arm pit. All the other symptoms have went away. The lymph node feels warm to touch, there is also a small area of redness around the injection site.   I am still having post COVID-19 symptoms as well which include nasal issues, weakness and brain fog. I have had all these symptoms since November.

A 65-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: L9261) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 27Jan2021 14:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing Sjogren&#39;s syndrome from 2015 (sees her Rheumatologist/ do blood work once a year to make sure her inflammation levels are okay), ongoing rosacea; dry eye syndrome (related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome); spasming, burning and twitching (last 2 medications she was on in November and January she had similar type reactions in her muscles); arthritis flareup from Oct2019 (in her left leg, she saw her neurologist who did tests and they came back normal) and sinus infection in 2020. Ongoing concomitant medication included ciclosporin (RESTASIS) for Sjogren&#39;s syndrome, ergocalciferol (VITAMIN D [ERGOCALCIFEROL]) for blood test: deficient and ascorbic acid, betacarotene, cupric oxide, tocopheryl acetate, zinc oxide (PRESERVISION) for dry eye syndrome related to Sjogren&#39;s syndrome. The patient previously took prednisone from Nov2020 and experienced weirdness in her legs got strong enough to keep her up at night and bad flare up for her leg symptoms; metronidazole for flare up or Rosacea (0.75% as needed, which she has used daily for last few weeks), meloxicam in Nov2020 and pantoprazole in Jan2021 and had bad flare up for her leg symptoms (symptoms subsided as soon as she stopped taking the medication after about 5 days); ibuprofen, acetaminophen and pepcid for her stomach. She had the vaccine, her first dose, on 27Jan2021, about a week ago. The first two days she didn&#39;t notice anything and then she had weird sensations in her legs on 28Jan2021. The second night she had a weird sensation in her legs which was similar to what she had experienced with the two medications she took in November and January. On 30Jan2021 the sensations spread through her body, she describes these sensations as twitching, burning, cramping, and tingling. She clarifies the sensations moved to her arms which did not happen with the other medications that she tried in November and January. Monday night, 01Feb2021, she was up all night and couldn&#39;t sleep and says she called the family doctor yesterday and he called in a prescription for Gabapentin 100 mg. She said she took the medication last night and she did sleep last night, but she was unsure if it was from exhaustion from the last few nights from not sleeping or the medicine, but she did sleep better and her symptoms were a lot less last night. Patient said she wanted to report this and that her concern is with the second dose; will she have a worse reaction, is there anything she can do or take and should she be concerned about it. She said the events gradually increased, they started mildly and then became significant. She felt the sensations a little bit in the day time but they start big time in the night when laying down. These sensations experienced in her legs started the second night, 28Jan2021, and then spread to her arms in the last couple of days which had not happened with her other incidences (with the medications mentioned above back in November and January). Clarified that the sensations spread to her arms on 29Jan2021, but the worst nights were 31Jan2021 and 01Feb2021. She said they were bad nights. She said in regard to her sleeping, starting on 29Jan2021, she was restless, she had trouble getting sleep and trouble getting in a comfortable position. She woke up frequently. Saturday the sleeping was a little worse, but she did sleep. She said on Sunday, 31Jan2021, and Monday, 01Feb2021, she hardly got any sleep. The sensations spread to her arms and it probably started a little on Saturday night, but Sunday and Monday it was very noticeable. She started Gabapentin; it was one a day before bed. The leg symptoms were still there last night. The sensations in her arms were not much at all. She did get up once with the leg cramp and was feeling tightness in her left leg but it never went into a cramp. The cramp was in her right leg, which was unusual because it was usually in her left leg. She stated she was unsure if her symptoms were starting to subside or if the Gabapentin had an immediate effect. The events did not require a visit to physician or ER. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome; Deep vein thrombosis; Both of her feet were only slightly swollen; Dull minor headache; Off-label use; Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered; Localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 65-year-old female patient (weight: 77.56 kg, height: 157 cm) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) at single dose, in the upper left arm, on 23Jan2021, for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included thyroid condition from an unspecified date (over 25-30 years before this report) and ongoing, controlled with levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID); and breast cancer from an unspecified date, in 2019 (treatment and surgery on an unspecified date, in 2019. Presumed resolved with radiation treatment, but no treatment within a year prior to getting Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine). The patient previously, on 05Jan2021 (18 days before the second dose), received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) for COVID-19 immunisation. After the first dose, the patient experienced localized discomfort at the injection site and swelling of feet. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from an unspecified date and ongoing, 0.88 mg, daily, for thyroid condition. On 23Jan2021, the patient experienced injection site discomfort described as &#34;localized discomfort where injection of second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine was given&#34;. On 24Jan2021, she had dull minor headache. On an unspecified date, the patient was hospitalized after the second dose and was diagnosed with May-thurner syndrome. She clarified that May-Thurner syndrome was where the iliac artery collapses and crushed the iliac vein in the upper abdomen; from that point down it started creating a blood clot. She developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) from her left ankle up to her right rib cage area; it was a monster. On 10Feb2021, the patient experienced deep vein thrombosis and thrombectomy was performed on the same day (outpatient thrombectomy surgery, performed 10Feb2021. It was a great surgery, very corrective. She never did have any pain or discomfort which confused everyone. She felt fine this whole time, no issues). On an unspecified date, both of her feet were only slightly swollen. Relevant laboratory test, performed on an unspecified date, in 2021, included computerised tomogram (CT scan with contrast of her abdomen and chest) that showed deep vein thrombosis: left ankle-right ribcage area. The adverse events May-Thurner syndrome and deep vein thrombosis were assessed as serious, hospitalization required from 02Feb2021 to 10Feb2021. The patient recovered from deep vein thrombosis on 10Feb2021, recovered from headache on 26Jan2021, recovered from swelling of feet and vaccination site discomfort on an unspecified date, while clinical outcome of the other events was unknown. Her vascular surgeon said he did not believe these events were vaccine related but cannot rule it out; her Primary Care Physician absolutely believed the events were vaccine related.   The information on the lot number has been requested.

A 65-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number RM9809), via an unspecified route of administration on 03Feb2021 at the 65 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included Muscular dystrophy. The concomitant medications included unspecified multiple medications. The patient received the first dose on 03Feb2021. Immediately after the vaccine on 03Feb2021 she had an anaphylactic reaction, received an Epipen, went to the ER was given steroids and sent home. Next day, still having symptoms, received second Epipen administration, went to Urgent Care, was admitted to hospital 04Feb2021. The patient stated she had a history of muscular dystrophy. She stated she was having issues breathing, swallowing, weakness, unable to take anything by mouth, didn&#39;t have normal respiratory support in Feb2021. It had affected her lungs, gut, muscles, everything. She may leave here on hospice. She wanted to know if there were others who had reported side effects such as hers.  She had anaphylactic reaction to the mineral. She was still in the hospital. She had lost ability to swallow and she was still having lung issues in Feb2021. She was a disabled rehab healthcare worker. She did not have an address right now in the hospital but if sent her something later once she get out she will be able to do that but she did not have it now. She takes multiple medications. Right now she cannot take medications she need orally. She had gone to hospital getting meds via primarily IV. She had acute anaphylactic reaction immediately after the vaccine and went by ambulance to hospital and was given steroids, care basically and sent home and she still had issues the next day and it kept going from home to urgent care to admission at the hospital. She had done lot of lab tests in Feb2021. She was very concerned that this was not going to be a temporary issue. She had form of muscular dystrophy and now what was happening was the week before she got the vaccine totally independent in her home, feeling ok, medications okay and now she was at IV medications not being able to swallow. She talked to someone yesterday and they told she should be calling and reporting what happened and that was why she had been on the phone all day.  She just want make sure she did not feel like the healthcare was reaching out to their own vaccination department and she want to make absolutely sure that not only does Pfizer know that have a horrid reaction but she want the healthcare firm that she had a horrid reaction and she want the CDC to know that she had a horrid reaction because right now she would tell all her friends with the severe form of muscle dystrophy she had not going to be vaccinated even though the researchers were telling her to get vaccinated. It was going to take a while to stop the efficacy again and having to be on the phone everyday when she was barely breathing. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures, which included Lab test unknown result in Feb2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Mostly gone within 30 min. Went home. Left side of Parotid started swelling - at 12/24/2020 in the morning. I didn&#39;t notice anything wrong until I tried to eat breakfast. Very painful. Swelled up very large. Couldnt&#39; eat much for four days when I finally saw my dr (28th). and he gave  a prescription: an antibiotic and that started helping. When I  salivated it would start to swell. Pain was worse the first day and I massaged it alot to force saliva out of the grand. Tried to eat for very bland and very little on one side of mouth. Augmentin  Amox-Clad 875 mg. was the antibiotic I was given and that took about 24 hours to help.

                                                2 days after vaccination right thighs and right leg started to have pain similar to pain I got with polymyalgia rheumatica that I have had in past and I though it was a flare up. A couple of days after that right leg started to swell and was warm. Went to ER on 1/29/2021 and had doppler which showed blood clots from groin area to below the knee. I was placed on Xarelto at that time. Got 2nd dose and about 24 hours latter back of thighs started to hurt again. Called doctor and applied heat and elevation and had no new swelling but I remain on Xeralto. Not sure if it was related but I have had no history of blood clots. 2 years previously broke my right patella and was with brace and no weight bearing for about 8 weeks and brace for 12 weeks without clot issues. Traveled by car a couple  thousand miles last year and no issues.

                                                On my way home from receiving the vaccine, I felt slight numbness in my lips (no further swelling, etc.).  Noticed some circumoral cyanosis around my lips after  arriving home. Had a fine afternoon (sleeping following vaccine and 16 hr. shift).  Had dinner and usual evening. Upon going to bed about 11pm,  I experienced chills for several hours, and shortness of breath. Very weak. Called 911 about 3 am - went to hospital ER - O2 sat. 90% enroute. Vital signs stable in hospital ER. Had neg. CXR, EKG, and labs. Also had slight cough and slight bronchial congestion. Received some IV fluids in ER. Left ER at 7am. Went home and slept all day, slight nausea in am. Awoke at 7pm - had good breakfast for dinner. Fine evening and night. Off the next day from work - usual day. It was like having Covid all over again (positive X2 in April - out of work for 5 weeks).  Although the symptoms began about 12 hrs. following the injection and subsided about 24 hrs. later).   My colleagues (work as a nurse in long term care - rehab) who had Covid in the past have experienced similar symptoms following the vaccine, even though we had Covid back in the spring. Dreading vaccine number 2 on Jan. 19th - hopefully I will be ok.

Noteworthy, I had  as a precaution taken prednisone 20mg p.o  about 2 hours before the injection.  I had to take more  later that afternoon because of symptoms. I then seem better but several times since the vaccine I have needed to uses the inhaler  and take prednisone  more than I have except after an infection about 6 years ago that precipitated similar symptoms to now. Today I had a flare significant enough that except for covid I might have gone to the ER or urgent care.

                                                Vertigo started after lying down the same night of getting the vaccine.  Vertigo continued every night and was accompanied by nystamus upon waking each morning.  Symptoms continued for the first several hours after awakening then would gradually get better and was much lighter during the day.  Would return every night and next morning and this continued for the next 7 days.   My head felt like it was in a fog and it seemed harder to think.  It was also very sinus like.  No nasal congestion, no post nasal drip, no cough, but my head felt thick and full.  I had headaches which I never get.  I took my blood pressure to be sure and it was normal.  I took Claritin (without the D), Flonase alone and then also Dymista, did the Neti pot, and took Ibuprofen.  Headache got better but still had the head fog.  Today is post vaccine day 8 and I finally woke up this morning feeling better.  Hope it lasts but I answered &#34;Unknown&#34; to Item 20 below because it&#39;s too soon to tell.

The other reaction, the one I am concerned about is that my bottom lip began to swell. The swelling continued throughout the night, swelling 3x normal size. It began to recede back to normal within 48 hours. Also, my lymph nodes under my right arm ( the injection arm) was very sore for 48 hours as well.

A 67-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261), intramuscularly on 22Jan2021 09:35 at 0.3 ml single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing High cholesterol, allergies to penicillin and sulfanized antibiotics, allergies to latex, Shingles since 2007, post herpetic neuralgia, mild shingles pain from the neuralgia, changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down. No other condition was reported. Concomitant medication included rosuvastatin (strength: 10mg) from 18Jan2021 to 24Jan2021 at 10 mg for High cholesterol. Past drug event included doxycycline allergy (she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP and unable to sleep), Ibuprofen allergy, Levaquin allergy, Valium allergy and omeprazole allergy, took sulfanized (SULFA) antibiotics allergy (she had rapid heartbeat, sweating). Patient stated she said that she had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and did experience some side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she did not have an anaphylactic reaction but had difficulty in breathing 2 days after having the first dose. She said she experienced 30 hours of labored breathing. She wanted to know if there is &#34;sulfa dioxide&#34; in the lipid/mRNA portion of the COVID-19 vaccine. She said she is highly allergic to &#34;sulfanized compounds&#34;. She is also allergic to all forms of penicillins. Caller wanted to know if the second dose of the vaccine has the same ingredients as the first dose. She wanted to know if the ingredients have the same amounts as the first dose or if the actives are stronger. She based this question from &#34;most people having more reaction on the second dose of the vaccine&#34; and also from what Pfizer second line told her &#34;the first dose primes the system while the second dose strengthens the system&#34;. She wanted to know what ingredient causes the anaphylactic reactions for this vaccine and if it is penicillin. On 22Jan2021 she learned that there is a small amount of Sulfa Dioxide in the lipid portion of mRNA and she is highly allergic to sulfa compounds. With her side effects she would also like to add that she had a severe case of shingles in 2007 that was not diagnosed until the end of the 7th week. She had seen 8 doctors, her family doctor, she had 3 ER visits so prior to the vaccine she had post herpetic neuralgia and so a week and half before the vaccine there were changes in temperature, the temperature and the weather going up and down so she was having mild shingles pain from the neuralgia going into the vaccine which was given on 22Jan2021. The other thing is she had high cholesterol and her cardiologist put her on a statin she does not have high BP but she has high cholesterol so she was started on a statin, it was Crestor 10 mg, actually it says it is Rosuvastatin Calcium 10 mg and she took that 18Jan2021 and the 19Jan2021 and then on the 20Jan2021 her doctor told her to stop it before her vaccine so she did and she felt okay just had mild reactions so she took the Rosuvastatin that Friday night 22Jan2021 and she took it 23Jan2021 then she took her self-off of it on 24Jan2021. She called her doctor on 25Jan2021 and he said yes stop the Rosuvastatin and stay off it until after your second dose of the vaccine. So she was having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 she has had a lot of side effects from being post shingles and all the side effects from COVID vaccine and being post shingles and the statin all of the possible side effects mirror one another. As far as the reaction she got a headache about 35 minutes after she took the shot Friday morning at about 9:35 AM and she took Tylenol twice that day, once that morning and she took it also around 4:30 PM when she was having medium pain at the injection site and that is when she took her statin and she woke up on 23Jan2021 and until late in the afternoon she had tightness in the chest so she took one more Tylenol then that was mid-morning, so total she had 3 doses of 325 mg Tylenol. Then on 24Jan2021 at about 4:30 AM in the morning she woke up with labored breathing, it wasn&#39;t normal. She did not have a closed throat but her breathing was labored, her chest felt tight there was a heaviness just like a feeling of discomfort. Then around 5 pm that same day the joint pain started in her right elbow, right thumb, right knee, left ankle and left instep and the pain wasn&#39;t constant it was jumping to different parts of her body and she still felt the tightness in her chest and heaviness all day. Then around 4PM on 24Jan2021, Saturday the labored breathing dissipated around 8pm and she did not take the statin that night then on 25Jan2021 her breathing was normal but she still had tightness in her chest. She had injection site pain on the 22Jan2021, 23Jan2021 and the 24Jan2021 and it was almost totally gone on 25Jan2021. Tiredness began on the evening 22Jan2021 the day she had the shot and it comes and goes. Headache- she had mild headache and she had took Tylenol so it was mitigated a little but it started 22Jan2021 and she had a headache through the 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021 and the 27Jan2021 so around 3:25PM yesterday she took another Tylenol yesterday 27Jan2021. Muscle pain she has had since 23Jan2021 and it has been ongoing but less today, she doesn&#39;t know if it will come back or not. It is mainly in the in the rhomboids which is the shoulder wings. She had it on both sides. Chills she had 25Jan2021, 26Jan2021 and 27Jan2021 and they come on mid-day-late afternoon they go on up until early evening, a little past supper/dinner time. Joint pain was 23Jan2021, 24Jan2021, 27Jan2021 and pain in her rhomboid muscles. She has had no fever, no swelling or redness at the injection site, no nausea.

Difficulty breathing 24Jan2021 at 4:30 am it woke her up and she had labored breathing, no closed throat and she stopped the Statin that day, tightness in her chest started 24Jan2021 in the morning and she had that 25Jan2021 26Jan2021 and it has been present on and off mainly in her back discomfort. She says the tightness is not really in the front around the heart but it is like a total tightness in the chest area. Muscle pain on the 27Jan2021 mainly in her back, the rhomboids. Fast heartbeat- She was sound sleep this morning at about 12:45AM and it woke her up her heartrate was 87, her BP was 135/81 (2021) and she did an ice pack for 16 minutes on her head and then she went back to sleep at 4:45 AM she woke up again her BP 131/87 pulse was 80 temp was 97.8 (2021). She didn&#39;t take her temp the first time she woke up she just did an ice pack for 16 minutes and she as up for a while typing side effects at that point. Then she went back to sleep from 6:20-7:20 and then when she woke up again her BP was 122/75 and pulse was 64, temp 98.3 (2021). For someone look at at her BP they may say that&#39;s not high but for someone post shingles, the pain, the nerve endings are already on edge she can feel it working on her body. They say reactions are proof that the vaccine is working but her issue with the joint pain, it disappeared when she stopped the Statin and then there is the labored breathing, she has had 2 new drugs that went into her system at the same time and she doesn&#39;t know, one has the documented side effects and the other one it is so unknown at least the mRNA part she does not know if she is just having a reaction to Sulfa. She says that blood pressure doesn&#39;t seem high but for someone whose body is stressed and with her pulse to go up when she is sound asleep, normally when her body is sleeping and she wakes up she would be about 117/70 (2021), she would have low numbers she doesn&#39;t have high BP. She took the statin for 2-3 days and then stopped it her doctor told her she could start and stop it and her doctor told her to stay off of it but she started it because she felt okay she only had a headache and injection pain so she said she is going to take it and then things intensified so she decided to stay off it. She has a history of having delayed serious side effects. She is allergic also to Penicillin and that is probably in the records already because she called and asked when she was thinking about taking it. It dates way back with her allergies with her, it is extensive Doxycycline, Ibuprofen, Levaquin, all forms of Penicillin, sulfanized antibiotics, Valium, latex, Omeprazole. She had shingles so bad after about 7.5 weeks of it going undiagnosed she had the 2 worse reaction and they asked her they went through her history and asked what are the 2 worst things she had and that was with Doxycycline they gave her that because they thought she had a bacterial infection and didn&#39;t realize it was shingles and she had a reaction to that she was sweating profusely and had very rapid heartrate and elevated BP she was unable to sleep literally she could feel the blood coursing through her veins. and then the other one she knows is Sulfa she has had that allergy since a child but she had rapid heart beat, sweating and there may have been other symptoms but she does not remember she was a child. She has been given Sulfa drugs since then and she is highly sensitive to Sulfa. Outcome of the event muscle pain was not recovered; injection site pain was recovered on 25Jan2021; labored breathing was recovered on 24Jan2021, while other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

By Monday afternoon my head started to ache &amp; skin of extremities started stinging, nose running &amp; feeling feverish. My ears started ringing too &amp; got vertigo. Also I started having trouble breathing with a slight ache/pain in my lungs. A noticible itch started in my nose &amp; a tickle in my throat and I had extreme muscle pain, especially in extremities affected by previous carpal tunnel injuries &amp; sciatica. Tuesday afternoon all symptoms were worsening so I used Zicam Gel swabs in my nose, made chicken garlic soup &amp; tea with honey &amp; went to bed. It took 3 days for the sinus, headache &amp; respiratory symptoms to resolve. The neuropathy (skin stinging) pain in my arms, hands &amp; lower legs persists and is very painful.

                                                Five days after the vaccine she was on the phone, sitting in a chair and she lifted her arm up and it felt heavy and it just dropped.  She then started to raise the arm and she was not able to do it.  She then suddenly lost sensation in her left arm.  She then could not control it, would raise when it wanted to but was not able to feel it or control it.  (had the feeling that it was not connected to her body and it was just floating around).  Then started having involuntary muscle spasms in her mid torso region.  The same thing then happened again and the muscle spasms were more intense and she waited around and lasted for minutes.  She never lost consciousness, but then it happened again and was spreading on her left side.  It then encompassed from her hip up to her shoulder.  The involuntary muscle spasms were moving from the side toward her chest to where she felt it would impact her breathing.  She then went to the ER and they started doing testing, and she had more spasms, and then started having double vision.  In talking with the doctor about all of this she had a CVA with complex partial epilepsy with recurrent seizures and that the double vision was related to the infarct in her brain and that the stroke triggered the seizure that she had.  She did not lose any memory, loss of consciousness, no weakness or loss of sensation.  These episodes only lasted minutes and a refractory time of minutes and when she got to the ER she the other episode when they were trying to test her.  They were not able to do the EKG or EEG due to the involuntary movements and these resolved.   She is now completely recovered other than the fatigue with no residual.    She saw a neurologist on 2/24/21 who felt like that she had a stroke and put her on Keppra and is going to FU in 3 months at IU.    It was ruled out that there was no relationship of her transplant to this reaction.   She is now on Keppra, Atorvastatin for the swelling in her brain, and also put on aspirin 81 mg.   Her blood tests that were done were all drawn and were all within normal limits except for kidney function, but is only a minor #&#39;s for her secondary to the transplant.  She then had some titers drawn for CMV and that was also negative.  Then she had a COVID test that was negative.  Then she had spinal tap that came back normal results.

That evening she reported not feeling &#34;right&#34;.  Over the next two days after receiving the vaccine on Thursday she reported to family that she didnt feel well. She had no fever but muscle aches, an earache and sore throat (this was on Friday and Saturday). On Sunday her breathing became a bit labored. She still had previous symptoms reported and labored breathing -- she stated she thought she would have to go to the Dr the next day (Monday, Feb 22, 201) if she did not feel better.   Sometime in the night of Feb 21st and Feb 22nd my mom passed away.   My mom had many health problems. Heart disease, diabetic, she was on dialysis and had sleep apnea. However, she definitely seemed to be having some difficulty with the affects of the first vaccine.   Please let her life be counted.

                                                Ten minutes after the vaccine was administered, I began to taste it in the back of my mouth, a metallic-type taste and felt tingling around my mouth. I had been sitting in the post-vaccine observation area during this time looking at my telephone. I approached the nurse&#39;s desk and reported what I was experiencing and was taken to another room where I was put in a wheelchair and vital signs were taken. By now I think I became very anxious and fearful and my heart felt like it was pounding at 104. My BP went to 188/79 which is high for me and I felt SOB. I truly think the VS symptoms were related to anxiety, but I continued to have the taste in my mouth and my tongue felt like sandpaper. I was given 50 mg BENADRYL and observed for 30 minutes.  After that amount of time, I felt better and safe to leave the hospital.  Today, 1/14/2021, I have felt excessive tiredness and mentally dazed with diarrhea.  No temperature, slight nausea this morning, and no vomiting. My left arm is only moderately sore. Now, at 7:30 pm I am feeling better and feel that I can work tomorrow.  Honestly do not know if it was an adverse reaction or excessive anxiety. I do not have anxiety disorder.

Seemed to subside in about 30 minutes.  Took a benedryl at bedtime.  In morning, seemed ok, though took another benedryl.  Seemed OK on this next day, but before bed, face was puffy, then woke up at 3:50 a.m. Saturday, and throat glands swollen and was having difficulty swallowing.

Vital signs were taken.  Blood pressure up slightly, heart rate slightly elevated Sent home without treatment but recommended I should take antihistamine at home. I took a 12-hour allegra about 12pm and a single 25 mg benadryl tablet at bedtime. The symptoms lasted about 3-4 hours before resolving.  They did not get worse from the immediate reaction. Recommended contacting my family physician for advice of what to do before 2nd shot which is scheduled for Feb. 15, 2021

I was cranky, not myself, going to bed, I woke several times as I rolled over onto my right arm.  When I awoke early, I was swollen from Head to Toes, my eyes were slits, my bracelets and rings were swollen into my skin, and my toes and ankles were large. AND I was grouchy about everything.  As the day went on I was just mad about everything,  I began to drink lots of water and tried to exercise to get the swelling down.   About noon, my eyes and face began to ease, but my body didn&#39;t ease till about 2pm, as my rings and bracelets were movable  then. I am still swollen and still angry and it is Friday.

                                                68-year-old female evaluated for painful movement of her extremities. Patient reports that her symptoms started the day after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacy. Patient was admitted. Patient has been evaluated by Neurology, Rheumatology and the Ortho-Spine Service. Symptoms improved with prednisone. Although unclear, a diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica was being considered due to elevated CRP (inflammatory marker). Relationship to vaccine administration is also unclear. Pt with Hx of arthritis, COPD, CAD, CHF, and HTN received first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Within 24 hours of vaccine administration, pt went to hospital c/o of painful movement of extremities. Pt was treated with prednisone and symptoms improved. She was evaluated by multiple specialties including neurology, rheumatology and orthopedics without a clear diagnosis. Her CRP was elevated to 17.2 mg/dL and Sed Rate to greater than 130 mm/hr and reactive ANA titer. Total CK was normal at 23 IU/L. Rheumatology wrote this is highly suggestive of COVID-19 vaccine induced polymyalgia rheumatica which has been reported with other vaccines but not with COVID-19 vaccines.

Medical history included insomnia and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated, &#34;I got the vaccine yesterday about 3 pm and I came home and I had dinner and sat down to watch TV at 9 O&#39; clock, I turn the program on and I was out like a &#39;light&#39; and this stuff knock me out (onset date: 29Jan2021). My dog has to wake me up licking my face at 3:15 this morning. I normally don&#39;t sleep long 4 hours and that&#39;s it. I&#39;m 68 years old and I have insomnia (History) but when I woke up I was stumbling around, still have to sleep (onset date Jan2021), I took the dog out to walk and came back and saw myself in mirror, my face was swollen and my eyes looks like little switch. I noticed, I was thirsty and I went to get and drank, some coke because I felt very sluggish and I drank some coke and when I was swallowing the coke I felt very odd sensation as I was swallowing, I noticed that after swallowing. I have asthma (History) to begin with so I&#39;m anticipated on having some of the symptoms it start showing up a bit, my nose started to running and I noticed that my whole entire face my head, down my back my neck was numb along with swelling on my throat, I felt okay but I felt it wasn&#39;t being, it was closing up but much wasn&#39;t closing up you know what I mean it was not full open. I also had muscle pain in my left arm where they gave me injection and it hurts my neck area across my back down my arms specially my left side. I also noticed I went to a lovely person and when I went to bathroom I pull my pants down I felt numbness on my legs. So, my whole body was kind of having that not tingling sensation but numb and when I ran my fingers across my leg you know how you feel numbness when you run your fingers across a part of your body when it&#39;s numb that&#39;s exactly how I felt and that was about 3:30 this morning that happened I woke up by but I also want to ask question because I got to go back to my second shot. I&#39;m wondering if I go back to my second dose am I going to have even more intense reaction to the stuff that I get this time.&#34; Patient further added &#34;I was still trying to eat something but I&#39;m feeling my teeth are still and my jaws are numb and this I got since yesterday (29Jan2021).&#34; The outcome of events was unknown.

A 68-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration from 29Jan2021 14:45 (2:45 PM) at single dose on right arm (as she was left handed) for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included COVID (recovered) on an unspecified date. There were no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Patient previously got her flu and shingles shot at the end of &#34;October&#34;. Patient took the vaccine last Friday (29Jan2021) at the age of 68 years old (reported as &#34;68 and a half&#34;). She does not know if that makes a &#34;different&#34; but her right arm felt like it was going to fall off it hurt so bad, on a scale of 1-10 it was about a 20. It was really tender she put a heating pad on it, she has been sleeping on the heating pad and it was mild now. It was only about a 3 now and it has come down, but it hurt like the dickens. Also she has ran a temperature and that finally broke but the highest was 102.4. Patient has slept around the clock and she has not been out of bed but like 30 minutes out of the last 24 hours (hrs) just to go the potty or drink something. Patient stated &#34;almost gave up holding it was so long&#34;. She has been so weak she has not been out of bed hardly. Patient said that she has eaten since, &#34;lets see Saturday night, Sunday, Monday&#34;. Patient has not eaten since Saturday night (30Jan2021) or gotten out of bed. She has not eaten anything. Patient has had COVID and recovered so she did not want to catch that again. She confirmed that she had COVID prior to received the vaccine. She called her primary care and she has a viral phone call tomorrow or visual phone call, whatever its called, she was trying to get over this mess, she feels warm, she was not registering a temperature right now but she had a cold sweat or something right now (01Feb2021). Patient has a call with him tomorrow so he will know about this incase Pfizer calls. Patient stated that she knows with a normal vaccine she might have an ache or something but this one hurt bad, maybe they pushed it in too hard or something she does not know. When asked for vaccination facility type, the patient answered that they had a vaccine clinic they had set up there in a conference room, they had an elaborate set up, go through certain places and there were several steps. Vaccine was not administered at facility (reported as &#34;No hospital&#34;). Patient further reported that her arm on 29Jan2021 (Friday evening) was tender. Patient lives by herself, she came home and does not know if she event ate. All she knows was she was real tired that Friday evening, it was tender and it got worse. Events did not require emergency room and physician room visit, reported as &#34;Not to date but tomorrow she does not know if he will have her come in unless she spikes another fever or if he will do anything she may just ride it out&#34;. When asked for adverse events prior vaccinations, the patient answered &#34;no none that she can remember. Sometimes she will have a sore arm that is why she gets it in the right arm because she is left handed thinkin her dominant hand will not have any problems but this one hurt really bad. Have they had many calls where this is really effecting arms really bad?&#34;. Patient also reported that her sister had the shot the same day and her arm was a little sore but that was all, she does not have NDC lot expiration for her sisters dose of the vaccine. She went to a different facility in a different location. Outcome of &#34;her right arm felt like it was going to fall off it hurt so bad&#34; was recovering, while for other events was unknown.

A 68-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via intramuscular injection on 20Jan2021 (at the age of 68-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing breast cancer stage IV, patient was in treatment for breast cancer stage IV, she had cancer 13 years prior the report in 2008, and then was found again and diagnosed 3 years prior the report, in Jun2018; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a long time, a lot of her adult life. The patient was on oxygen; she had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer; patient tested positive for COVID in 2020 (Feb2020 or Mar2020, as reported). She and her roommate tested positive and had a cough. They had no fever or other symptoms. Both in the nursing home got over the cough and 21 days later tested negative. Patient tested negative for COVID ever since. The nursing home tested the residents and staff every week. They had tested the patient so much to the point her nose was bloody which the reporter got upset about; hallucinations and paranoid thoughts. Concomitant medications included ongoing perphenazine (TRILAFON) taken for hallucinations and paranoid thoughts; treatment for breast cancer stage IV and oxygen. The patient lived in nursing facility and had received both Pfizer vaccine doses. The patient received the first vaccine for COVID-19 immunisation in Dec2020. She was fine. She got the second one on 20Jan2021. Since patient received the 2nd vaccine dose, in Jan2021, she was having confusion and dementia, which was not an issue before the vaccine doses. The patient was having trouble putting words together. Patient initially had vomiting, nausea and brain fog where she could not concentrate on her TV, in Jan2021. She was hospitalized from 17Feb2021 to 20Feb2021 to have all kinds of tests run and see if her cancer had spread to her brain. Patient had 3 years with stage 4 breast cancer and had fought so hard and was aware of her confusion and it was very upsetting to her. She had days of vomiting and nausea. She complained of brain fog and could not focus on the tv or her programs. Within days, she went into this kind of like dementia-like state where she talked incessantly and could not get a thought completed. Patient would go from one thought to the next. It was very bizarre. She had never had this kind of issues. This went on for so long, they finally put her in the hospital. Patient had stage 4 breast cancer, and the doctors thought maybe her cancer had gone to her brain. The doctor did not think it was related to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was checked for a urinary tract infection (UTI), for brain cancer, for a stoke, for everything. She saw so many doctors. She still had not come out of this a month later. She was currently on psych meds because she had mood swings, since Jan2021. It had been one thing after another. The patient could not tell the time. On some level, patient knew something was wrong. She was in a very confused state. She did not know how to tell anyone what she wanted to tell. It was very distressing to say the least. She had made a little bit of progress. She could tell time with some struggling but she got upset and cried. Patient could only tell that the time was 3, but not 3:15. But, then she cried and got upset. She had been able to tell time a couple of times, but if you asked her what day was it, she had no clue. She had no clue what day it was and would ask &#34;what day is it?&#34; Her moods all over the place. The patient was still very confused. The reporter explained the patient could be 5&#39;3&#39;&#39;, she was unsure. The reporter really did not know the patient weight, she was guessing around 270lbs. She had a lot of fluid built up from the cancer, and reporter had not seen her since COVID started. Patient told that her weight was up around 300lbs. The reporter declined to include a healthcare professional for the report, stating she had not spoken to her sister&#39;s primary care doctor. She was waiting for her to call back. The patient was sent to the ER and admitted into the hospital on 17Feb2021. She came back from the hospital on 20Feb2021 at 6:30pm. She had a CAT scan, MRI, bloodwork done, in Feb2021. She saw a psychiatrist, neurologist, her oncologist. There was so many doctors seeing her and talking to the reporter. The last doctor the patient saw in the hospital said that she thought the patient was dehydrated from her vomiting episodes, but did not know for sure. In Feb2021, the nursing home did blood tests and a urinalysis to see if she had a UTI. The blood work would have shown if patient was dehydrated and she was not. The head nurse thought it was the vaccine, but she was not sure. Everybody was not sure. No one could tell her anything concrete about patient. She was not normally like this. Patient had recovered completely from the nausea and vomiting. They tried for a while to give her an anti-nausea medicine, but she could not keep anything down. It was given to her orally, she did not know why an injection was not given. This lasted for a few days, clarified as maybe 3 days. The reporter had no name, NDC, lot number or expiry date for the anti-nausea medicine the patient took. She knew it was given to her once and when they tried to give it to her again, patient refused. Reporter had no product information to provide for the first and second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, did not have the patient vaccine record card. This would be with the nursing facility. She mentioned patient went into the nursing home on Jan2018 and then was diagnosed with breast cancer Jun2018. She did not know if there were any interactions there with the patient having the breast cancer and receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The reporter had no product information for the first dose. When probed for the date in which the first dose was given, she explained she was sent constant emails which could have provided a date, but she did not know this information offhand. It was approximately a month before the second dose, or it could have been on 27Dec2020, which was a little closer than a month apart. No additional vaccines were administered on the same date of the Pfizer vaccine. The events required a visit to emergency room. Patient had constant testing while in the hospital. In the hospital, in Feb2021, they did MRI and CAT scan to see if the breast cancer had gone to the brain and both were negative. They tested for UTI. They did the first UTI test at nursing home in 2021 and they said she had a UTI and patient was put on an antibiotic. They tested her again for a UTI when she was admitted into the hospital in Feb2021 and they said she did not have a UTI. She did have a buildup of urine in her bladder because her kidney functions were not good enough for the MRI at first, in Feb2021. Her bladder was relieved of the urine build up and her kidney functions improved and she was able to get the MRI. The MRI did not show any cancer in the brain. None of it relieved her symptoms. This was just bizarre. It happened within a week of receiving the vaccine. She could not talk with patient and patient had never been like that. The patient had always been lucid and open and you could talk about anything: the past, the present, she had no problems. She could remember everything crystal clear from the past but she could not remember or know everything from the present. The reporter would ask her what day was it and the patient did not know. The patient would absorb the information she was told but there was like this strange disconnect, almost like a dementia of some form. About concomitant medications, the reporter explained the patient had not started anything new. She had been on the same stuff for many years. She had psych meds that she had been on, but she had been on those for many years. She clarified further that patient had been stable on her psych meds for many years, and the nursing facility had the patient stable for 3 years at the nursing home. At the time of the report, her mood swings were all over the place, she had never had that before. She had hallucinations and paranoid thoughts in the past, but she had never had mood swings like this and never had dementia. She had been on the same medications for a long time, but they were currently trying to play with them and trying to adjust her psych meds. It was apparent it was not working and this was something more organic, something going on in her body. The psych med was perphenazine all of her life. The psych nurse was a new nurse and was not familiar with the patient. The psych nurse informed the reporter she raised the perphenazine to the highest dose she could possible go on and told she could have to try the patient on a mood stabilizer and could have to put her in a psych unit. The reporter would not have any NDC, lot numbers or expiration dates, or anything like that. The reporter had been told an UTI could have caused the patient symptoms. It could have been brain cancer, or this or that. She did not know what was going on. Reporter asked if there had been any reports or had other people called in with these types of reactions or adverse events. The patient had recovered from vomiting and nausea on an unknown date in 2021, had recovered from kidney functions were not good enough and UTI in Feb2021, the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

She reported that her tongue was tingling and she still has some swelling in her lips.

She was scared because she was not covered fully, since she can&#39;t get the second shot of Pfizer, and she was afraid of the Epi Pen, so she was really in a tough spot. ER doctor stated she may be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, as the second, but she needs to talk to her Primary care about that. The ER doctor continued to tell her it would have to be a special case where she was in a hospital setting in case she has another serious reaction, she was concerned for not receiving the second dose because that means she was not completely covered with one vaccine.

Doctor wanted to know if she would be able to take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. He said if she got the second shot, of the Johnson and Johnson, that it would have to be a special case, like in a hospital setting, and there would have to be medical people in a medical center, to take care of her was she has a reaction to it as well. He advised that she take the Johnson and Johnson than not taking it, because by not taking it, she was very vulnerable to catching COVID 19. And patient wanted to know was it a preservative that was causing the reaction. It was reported that rash began around 10PM, bloody stool began between 11 PM and 12:30 AM, all other symptoms within 15-20 minutes, it began around 6PM, maybe sooner 5:55 PM, she was in denial, it felt like tongue and lips tingling, she did have a reaction before to a different shot.

                                                She had the vaccine at the facility where she lives.  She fainted less than 24 hours after the vaccine, got up from that and had dry heaves, lost her speech and had loose stools.  The aide caught her as she was fainting as she would have fallen on the floor.  She said it was weird, she looked at people and it looked like they were 2 dimensional and knew something was wrong, but couldn&#39;t figure out what as they attended to her.  They asked her questions, but she was not able to speak to them.   They apparently spent 2 hours with her, but she doesn&#39;t believe it was that long, and then they knew she wanted to go to one Hospital and not the other.  She had been loosing words before this happened, but not as bad as this one.  This was about the same reaction that she had when she got the COVID virus in January.  She was then taken to the hospital where she was given fluids and hydrated her and checked her heart, saw a cardiologist and a neurologist to see if those things caused the fainting and had blood work done.  They also did a CAT Scan of her head and neck.  They told her that she was fine and was discharged back home after 5 days, which was 3/11/21.  Since then she has been very tired, she does have GERD and her stomach has been hurting a lot as well.

I knew there was potential for side effects before taking the vaccine...I was totally unprepared for so many symptoms and how intense they were and what little I could do to relieve any of them. Never had fever that I am aware of. Today I?m weak and sweating is unreal.  ?? Should I prepare/expect my second dose around Feb. 14 to have the same effect on me.? Not looking forward to that. I was almost ready to go to the ER I was getting so dehydrated and weak.

However, it isn&#39;t on the list of side effects but I&#39;ve had hot flashes every few hours since about and  2 hours after my first dose injection.  For the most part they are mild but come on every 1 to 4 hours while I&#39;m awake.  I had a terrible one like I&#39;d never had before where I was soaked through my clothes almost exactly 24 hours after the shot the following day.  They are still occurring now 72 hours after the shot.  they are mostly bothersome and will hopefully subside in the next few days.  Other than that I only had the normal local tenderness on my arm.

On her way home she started having bowel issues, got home and an hour to hour and half later got explosive diarrhea, which lasted 24 hours.  The spot on her arm got larger, more tender and felt warm to touch.  It got to be the size of a half softball size, no swelling.  Then she started having trouble breathing, could not walk as far or fast without breathing problems.  She then took it easy, and the breathing issues got worse for 36 hours.  On Sunday her arm was better, less sore and the diarrhea had stopped.  She then stopped improving and on Tuesday 2/16/21, she was told to go to the minute clinic on 2/18/21 and when she got there her pulse rate was 40, her oxygen level was 93, and her BP was elevated.  The NP there she got her oxygen level up to 94, was real raspy in her lungs.  She was sent to the UC and they sent her to the ER.   She was seen in the ER and isolated her, did an EKG, had a chest x-ray, gave her breathing treatments, and waited on her results, which all came back fine.  They gave her 150 mg of Prednisone, another breathing treatment and within 1 1/2 hours her oxygen level was up to 97 and all of her tests were negative and they sent her home.  She has now been home since last Thursday with nebulizer treatments Ipratropium bromide and Albuteral sulfate 3 times a day, rescue inhaler 4 puffs every 6 hours, Advair twice a day as well.   She does have a FU with her doctor tomorrow for recheck.    She feels that she is almost back to normal.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration, in the right arm on 26Jan2021 at 15:46 PM, (at the age of 69-year) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, pacemaker insertion. Concomitant medication was not reported, however, the patient reported that she takes medicines for hypertension, and is on blood thinners. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient reported that on 26Jan2021, after receiving the vaccination she did wait a half hour and the only symptoms she thought at the vaccination visit was a little blurred vision, which was temporary and went away. At 16:30, about 45 minutes to 1 hour after she left the vaccination center, as she was driving home, she informed that she was feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/face was really tingling and numb, and she had difficulty swallowing;  her throat started to feel like it was closing up and her tongue was really thick.  She stated she tried to stay calm and forced herself to drink a bottle of water. She had no idea where there was any emergency area since she was not familiar with the area and tried to calm herself down and took sips of water and made sure she was breathing okay and it all went away. The reaction lasted 10-15 minutes and seem to resolve when she was able to calm herself down. She stated it was scary, and once she calmed down it all went away.  She was concerned about receiving the second dose. She did not go to a physician or emergency room, but says she probably should have. The clinical outcome of little blurred vision, feeling numbness in her face around her cheeks and mouth/her face was really tingling and numb, difficulty swallowing, throat started to feel like it was closing up, and tongue got thick was recovered.     The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                A day after the vaccine, she experienced shortness of breath.  This worsened and as a result, triggered a COPD episode which also led to Tachycardia.  Her heart rate was 170 and she could not breath.  She had to be rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

                                                My second COVID-19 vaccination injection on Friday morning, 2/19/2021 resulted initially (starting on Saturday, the day following the vaccination} in a sore right wrist and a much more painful right arm that steadily grew in intensity and spread rather rapidly into my upper torso.  By the following day (Sunday, 2/21) my breasts became very sensitive and I had severe pains across my back.  This may or may not have been the beginning of a banding type MS exacerbation, but by Monday, 2/22, it was clear that I was experiencing a full-blown and seriously disabling exacerbation. Both legs experienced the tingling and numbness I have had in a prior exacerbation, and by the time I was able to talk to Dr. (my neurologist) on Monday afternoon (2/22), the numbness had progressed upward into my lower abdomen and I was no longer able to stand at all.  It appears highly likely that the MS attack was triggered by the response of my immune system&#39;s reacting to the discomfort and severe body pains that occurred following the vaccination.  I told Dr. of the total loss of feeling and use of both legs and was experiencing a increasing numbness from toes up to abdomen.  Before ordering the high doses of corticosteroids used to stop my exacerbation, Dr. sent me to the Emergency Room for testing to make sure I did not have an infection that could be covered up by the steroids.  When this testing did not show any such infection, the ER administered an IV infusion of 1 gram of solumedrol, followed by gradually decreasing high oral doses of prednisone.  As of this date, numbness has started decreasing and some limited  utility of right leg has returned.  Still i can no longer stand and perform even the minimal movements to-and-from wheelchair to bed or toilet without substantial physical help (not needed before this exacerbation) from my sole caregiver, my husband.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248, expiry date: 30Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 24Jan2021 07:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient&#39;s granddaughter had COVID virus and passed to the patient. The 2nd dose appointment scheduled for 14Feb2021. Patient stated she had the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 24Jan2021 at 0715AM in the right arm. After that, she found out she got infected with COVID 19. On 01Feb2021, she tested positive for COVID 19. On 28Jan2021 (also reported as on 28Jan20201 or 29Jan2021), she was feeling bad. Her little granddaughter had COVID virus (was infected at the school) and passed it on to her. Now she has been going to different places checking it out and she went to urgent care because her heart was beating fast on 02Feb2021. She had an electrocardiogram and her lungs were okay on an unspecified date. They told her was eligible to get an infusion but she doesn&#39;t know what it is. The urgent care clinic told her she could get the infusion but then she can&#39;t get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. She wants to ask if this is true. She was being offered a monoclonal antibody infusion. When ask if this is the first time to call, she stated she called once before right after she found out that she had the COVID 19 infection to ask if she could still get the second shot. She did report at that time that she had gotten the first dose and then tested positive for COVID 19 and she previously provided product information including the lot number from her vaccine card. She added that her heart has been going very fast and has been having fever on 02Feb2021 for two or three days. It is not as high today as it was before. She does want to get the second dose. The first dose helped her so much. On 04Feb2021 (reported as yesterday), she was checked at urgent care because of heart concern and a bit of pressure in chest. Patient stated she only had a little cough, sore throat and runny nose, but she hasn&#39;t experienced any other symptoms on an unspecified date. The patient&#39;s weight was 54.43 kg on 01Feb2021. The outcome of the events &#34;fever&#34; and &#34;her heart was beating fast&#34; was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was unknown. Patient was scheduled to receive her second dose on 14Feb2021.

A 69-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EM5318), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left upper arm on 09Feb2021 at 11:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included premature ventricular contractions (PVC) from an unknown date wherein her pulse goes up into the 120s and had to go to the ER. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received Pneumovax 23 on 14Jan2021. The patient called about the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The patient had the shot on 09Feb2021 and the 10th she was fine then on 11Feb2021, she started having side effects. She is calling it side effects but what she is describing, she has these episodes periodically but she has not had one in 2 years but it was bad one and it happened 2 days after her vaccine, she is not sure if it was side effect but she doesn&#39;t want to mess with it so she wants to tell someone. On 11Feb2021, the reaction started around 1:30 PM. She started feeling real jittery, she was hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms down to her elbows. She could feel her heart pounding and she had these before but no one seems to know what causes it. She worked with it she was busy doing other things then around 4PM that day it started getting worse. She could tell her blood pressure was getting involved. She started taking her blood pressure, from 4:30 on until 12:30AM she had crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89 and the highest pulse was 106 but it goes up to 188 and then it would be 158, 179, 155, 119, 166 and those are the top number of the blood pressure. Her pulse pretty much stayed high 80s 90s except for the time it was 106. After midnight, her BP was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71 and her pulse was 78 and she slept much better, she slept for 4 hours she woke up feeling like heart pounding but her blood pressure was 125/69 and her pulse was 74. She also has PVC and sometimes they say when she feels her heart pounding and her blood pressure and pulse are fine, they said that is probably PVC. When her blood pressure and pulse goes way up she is miserable. She had it so that her pulse goes up into the 120s with this and she has had to go to ER before. She clarifies her pulse being in the 120s and having to go the ER was in the past, prior to the vaccine. She says no one can figure out what it is. Some said it was anxiety, she sat through a whole program on anxiety and they decided not that is not what it is. But the fact that she hadn&#39;t had one of these episodes in 2 years and she had a good sized one 2 days after the vaccine, she had a really hard one that is why she thought she better report it. It has definitely gotten better she still feels jittery and heat flush every once in a while, but her blood pressure is fine. It is 139/74 and pulse 74. She can tell its still there but improved and certainly not uncomfortable. The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or the physician&#39;s office but she contacted her doctor&#39;s office and she has an online thing with them in a half an hour from the time of the report. The outcome of the event crazy blood pressure fluctuations the highest was 188/89/bp was around 159 or 150 then it came down to 136/71 and heart pounding/highest pulse was 106 was recovering while the outcome of the events feeling real jittery and hot flush feeling like an adrenaline rush in her upper chest and arms was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the contribution of the suspect drug to the onset of event  blood pressure fluctuation cannot be excluded.

It was hard/where she got the injection; It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge.; Fever blister; heart beating so out of rhythm; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 69-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: EN6207), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 18Mar2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 69-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing coeliac disease; hypothyroidism, is diabetic and has irregular heartbeat from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine taken for hypothyroidism; hydrochlorothiazide, olmesartan medoxomil (OLMESARTAN/HCTZ MYLAN) taken for blood pressure measurement; metformin, glipizide and pioglitazone hcl taken for diabetes mellitus; acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN 81) taken for thrombosis; metoprolol taken for heart rate irregular, cyanocobalamin (VIT B12) taken for an unspecified indication, all from an unspecified start date and ongoing; famotidine, rosuvastatin, vitamin d2, vitamin d3 and potassium, all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6198, NDC: 59267-1000-1, expiry: unknown) on 27Feb2021 at 1:40PM for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient got her last shot on 18Mar2021. The first day was fine. She woke up the next morning at three or four with her heart beating so out of rhythm it was crazy. It took almost the whole day. She called her cardiologist and couldn&#39;t get into them and she didn&#39;t want to go to the ER. She didn&#39;t have a way to prove any of that. She also got a baseball sized lump. It was hard. If she laid her arm on it, it was painful on the left side where she got the injection between her left breast and axilla. It extended underneath the axilla. She wasn&#39;t able to get in with the cardiologist because she waited to late in the day. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch that day because her heart was so out of rhythm. She was very tired and wanted to just lay down. She hates going to the hospital. She doesn&#39;t want to go to the hospital. She has a history of irregular heartbeats. She should have gone in and had an EKG. She has pictures of the lump if those are needed. HCP information: Her doctor had said if she had anything like any abnormal heart beats to come in and get an EKG. She also had a fever blister on 22Mar2021 that she hasn&#39;t had in years and was asking if this influences her immune system. She had the lump and that was in the lymph node and now a fever blister on the top lip. Heart beating so out of rhythm: it lasted all that day. She took a nap after she talked to the doctor&#39;s office and slept for several hours. When she woke up it was kind of back in rhythm, but it was going in and out. It wasn&#39;t as frequent as it was prior to nap. Prior to the nap it was almost continuous. It slowed down a lot on the 19Mar2021 and was gone by 20Mar2021. Outcome of event: She has PAC&#39;s and PVC&#39;s anyway. That is why she follows up with the cardiologist. They haven&#39;t been so out of rhythm as they were after the vaccine. She couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She still has them occasionally and that is kind of normal for her. She was weak and tired. Baseball sized lump: it has gone down. She took pictures to show her friends who were all getting the shots. It is gone now. It might have started on 20Mar2021. She woke up with the lump on Saturday. She has recovered completely. Her daughter said she needed to get it checked out. Reporter had heard of a lump on the breast was a side effect. It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge. Seriousness criteria: It was irritating because it was so big. It was painful if she put her arm down. It was like her breast were engorged. Causality: Heart beating so out of rhythm: she hasn&#39;t had it that bad, so she thinks it was. She had it a long time ago, maybe once before, but it never lasted that long or took her down like that. She is not the only one that has had the complaint of irregular heartbeats. She put on social media what she experienced and how weak she got. Several friends said that happened to them as well. She doesn&#39;t know their history. Reporter declined to do a report on her friends. That was another reason she didn&#39;t go to the hospital. She thought it was a normal side effect. She thinks she found on her paperwork about the lump in the lymph nodes. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included electrocardiogram: unknown results and heart rate: irregular on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever blister was not recovered, while of the rest was unknown. Reporter seriousness for heart beating so out of rhythm was reported as disabling.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and the plausible temporal relationship, a possible contributory role of suspect product BNT162B2 to the reported events &#39;heart beating so out of rhythm &#39;, &#39;baseball sized lump (where she got the injection/It looked like it was connected to the breast because it was so huge)&#39; cannot be completely excluded.

This consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248 and expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took shingles vaccine for immunization and experienced shingles. The patient reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021. On 17Jan2021 night and into 18Jan2021, she felt scratchy in her throat. She did not think anything of it because the temperature change was not unusual in the patient&#39;s state and so she thought it was that. But, on 19Jan2021, her throat was more scratchy and then her nose started running more. By Wednesday, 20Jan2021, her nose was like a faucet, non stop, clear and her throat was definitely scratchy and she was sneezing non stop. Her injection site was sore too which she totally expected. Now, her physician has given her a steroid pack and did a rapid test, which was negative but the following day they are doing a PCR test, so, she will see. She also stated that she can still smell but can&#39;t taste and that started last night, 20Jan2021. She asked if they were seeing these. And if this was listed or being reported and if she should get the second dose. She went on to state that &#34;I would not call my symptoms severe and I&#39;m having my PCR tomorrow, but when they mention to me that they have had other patients with this experience&#34;. She also asked if it can it give her COVID since her symptoms were similar to COVID and other people are having symptoms. She also reported that 4 months ago, she got her first shingles vaccination and &#34;it knocked me on my butt, I still haven&#39;t got the second injection but I got shingles&#34; and asked should she have gotten the COVID vaccine if she just got over shingles 3-4 weeks ago. She reported that she got her first dose of the COVID vaccine on 13Jan2021 and her second dose is scheduled for 30Jan2021 (17days apart). She did not have a question about the timing of the vaccine, only mentioned when her second dose was due and the it was 17 days after the first. She wanted to know if Pfizer was seeing a lot of this, and it could this her body reacting to the vaccine. She wanted to know what she should do with the second vaccine, if she should get it. She works at a school and has been making sure to wash her hands and everything. The outcome of the events Rhinorrhoea, and Vaccination site pain was unknown. The outcome of the event ageusia was not recovered while the outcome of the rest of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021082498 same drug/event, different patients

Patient received the first vaccination on the 15Jan2021 and she did not have any symptoms until Tuesday (19Jan2021), she started feeling kind of bad, she was very prone to allergies, she just thought it was back, this was her season to get sick if she had to get allergies, this was when it happened like January early February, so she went to Urgent care and she wanted a cortisone shot and she didn&#39;t think she should get a cortisone shot because it would effect the effectiveness of vaccine, so they said no and they would like to swab her nose to rule out that she didn&#39;t have COVID, and he did and it came out positive, so she wanted to get our opinion that if we thought it was a true positive or false positive. She thought she couldn&#39;t get COVID after she got the part of vaccine, and the second question she had was her second dose would be on 05Feb2021 by that she would be out of quarantine so should she plan and take the second one.

A 70-years-old female patient started to received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 13Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included dystonia and migraines from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 antibody test positive from Nov2020 to an unknown date. The patient was taking unspecified concomitant medication for dystonia and migraines. The patient experienced a &#34;severe allergic reaction&#34; to her first dose of BNT162B2 in Feb2021. She had all-over body rash that was &#34;very red, like a tomato&#34; and showed up 35-40hours after her dose.  She states her doctor does not recommend she get the second dose. The patient meant by allergic reaction, she had a number of things, she experienced tiredness, injection site pain, joint muscle pain, she felt unwell, this all happened on the Saturday, the same day she got the vaccine on 13Feb2021. Then on Sunday 14Feb2021, all the symptoms she spoke about were still there and so she rested all day. On 15Feb2021, she looked at her elbows, clarifying the inside of elbow, her elbow creases, and on both elbow creases the skin was red, both sides same size, then probably an hour later it was on her chest, underneath her breast, down to her stomach, past the vagina, everything was red swollen down to her thigh, it was working it&#39;s way down to the knee, the color was like a beet red, tomato color,  it was under the arms, started with elbow, was at her neck. The more down the redness spread, the more it red in color it also got. When she noticed this she called the doctor. When she called the doctor, the doctor said get over to the Emergency Room right away. Her husband and her were both on the phone and were telling the doctor that she doesn&#39;t want to go to hospital,  she asked if she can just come into the doctors office. The doctor said No. He told her that needs to get special lab work done, and he needs to send her information over to the ER. He said this could do possible damage to the kidneys. The doctor said lets not forget the last time she did a blood test, which was in Nov2020, at that time she came up positive with COVID antibodies. It could have been possible that she had COVID and was asymptomatic, or she had it. The doctor said that they need to do another COVID test or it could be she had a COVID cold or a cold with antibodies, her doctor doesn&#39;t know. The fact that she had that test that came back with COVID antibodies  test but not have COVID in Nov2020 was something to consider. He was concerned may be there is more to this, or just a rash. The doctor said that he is not equipped say what it should be. The doctor said he will speak with them at the hospital. Tiredness subsided yesterday afternoon on 15Feb2021, it subsided before she went to the ER visit. Right now, it&#39;s kind of like a lasting effect because she is not feeling normal. The injection site pain was still there but not as bad. The joint muscle pain subsided this afternoon around 1 o clock. It first began a half hour after leaving the stadium and she was experiencing it while driving back home, the pain continued and got worse. When she got up on Sunday morning her whole body was in pain, she was not getting better on Sunday and that&#39;s when she sat on couch rest of the day. For red skin, with the temperature of the skin, she didn&#39;t feel it to see if it was hot or anything, it was more this feeling that its just not going away getting worse, it didn&#39;t feel hot, there was no texture on the skin either. She just noticed she was flushed red. She called the doctor first, and he said that he was sending information to the emergency room. Then she went to (name of place withheld) ER. They took her temperature, there was no fever. She was then relieved from the ER in 2.5 hours and went home. She still has redness on the skin. In the hospital, they gave her 40 mg of prednisone and an injection or Benadryl, and prescription for prednisone to take for the next 4 days while tapering down. She did take Benadryl about 2 hours ago, she did notice all the sudden she was getting itchy. She is less itchy now. With the itchiness, she just observed this about 2 hours ago. She took Benadryl, she has somewhat improved, she is still itchy but not to the point that she will scratch heavily.

A 70 -year-old female patient received her  first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration (on left arm) on 15Feb2021 (at the age of 70 -years-old), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, sleep apnea, thyroid problem, prediabetes, cpap use, all from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications. Patient reported her face is blood red. Last night her chest was hurting radiating to my arm down. It felt like someone was strangling her with water. She noticed my symptoms were what people experience after receiving the second dose. She had fever, chills, exhausted and just felt very tired after receiving the first dose. She still have trouble breathing. She had severe asthma. She was not breathing normally. When she put the mask on it&#39;s even harder to breath. She was worried. She thinks, she might have the coronavirus. Consumer says that she is still not feeling well after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on February 15th. She says that the first day after getting it, she had pain in her arm, it was achy, it was not really painful enough to where she had to take Tylenol for it. She says yesterday on the second day she had fever, chills, tiredness, general malaise, and today she is not feeling well. Caller says she was having trouble breathing, and did a treatment with her nebulizer which she has because she has real bad asthma. She says her breathing is labored and she wheezes every once in a while. She says she would like to see if there is anything that she needs to do, because she works with children, and if she is coming down with the corona virus she doesn&#39;t want to be around them with it. She says that her breathing is problematic today. She says she doesn&#39;t think that she is having a severe reaction, she has no rash or those kind of symptoms. She says it seems to be just the asthma, and last night she drank some water and choked on it then couldn&#39;t get her breath and her chest hurt and she had pain down her arm and thought oh gosh she was having a heart attack.Caller says she has done no treatments other than the nebulizer treatment. No further details provided about the nebulizer treatment. Caller says the provider said no Tylenol right away, so she didn&#39;t take any yesterday with her fever, and she didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take her temperature, but her face was really hot and she was having chills, which usually means she has a fever. She says that her arm that was sore was the one where she had her injection. She says that never really was that bad, everyone said their arm had ached, and she has a high pain threshold so it never bothered her. Her wheezing and little trouble breathing was better, after she did some breathing treatments with the nebulizer, she is not breathing well but she is breathing better. She says she is also shaky and doesn&#39;t know if that is just nerves, or if this is also something going on. Caller says that it has been a while since she had blood work, which was the last time she went to see physician, but she doesn&#39;t know the results for what they found out. The outcome of the events Breathing difficult,wheeze was recovering, other events was unknown.

This 70-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 01Feb2021 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL9262, Expiration: May2021) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Atrial fibrillation from Jan2020. Had 2nd dose appointment scheduled but canceled appointment. Concomitant medications included apixaban (ELIQUIS) from 07Feb2021 at 5mg twice a day by mouth (provided SN100089537925, LOT 1771228, EXP: May2023, NDC: 0003-0894-21) for Atrial fibrillation. History vaccine included a Tetanus shot 40 years ago (1981) for immunisation and reacted terrible to it. She reports having and experienced soreness, redness, and pain at injection site. She reports getting a mammogram sometime after receiving the vaccine. They saw a spot they are going to recheck and saw swollen lymph nodes on the left side/ Enlargement of lymph nodes, which is the same side she received her vaccine. She was told it was most likely due to the vaccine. Six days later she suddenly felt sick, near syncope, couldn&#39;t catch her breath.  It got so bad she thought she was dying and called EMS.  Leads confirmed afib, her blood pressure was really high and kept going up and down like a roller coaster. She was taken to the ER and began feeling sick to stomach in ambulance.  IN the ER she received 1000 ml of fluids and additional metoprolol in addition to dose she took that evening at home.  She was sent home to follow up with her Cardiologist the following Monday. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was due to vaccine and started her on twice daily eliquis and increased her toprolol immediate release to twice daily.  The following Friday night she got a headache and felt her ears vibrating.  Her home EKG was fine, but blood pressure was high again and stayed up for hours. Took additional toprolol. Came down after 5 hours. Breast, arm and clavicle starting hurting two weeks and one day after the injection. She is anxious about getting the second vaccine. Asked PCP if she needed an antigen test to see if she needed a second dose of the vaccine. She says she got her first dose 01Feb, then on Wednesday, 03Feb she went and got a mammogram which had already been planned. She says that they saw enlarged lymph nodes to her left breast, under arm, and clavicle which they said are due to vaccine, but they also said they saw something else so they wanted to do a repeat mammogram three months later. She says it took two weeks, but suddenly her left breast and under arm were killing her, caller did not clarify this statement. She says she talked to her doctor who said don&#39;t worry it might take a while to go down. She says that the other thing is she has known atrial fibrillation that was diagnosed a year ago, and most of the time it is quick and doesn&#39;t last long, sometimes she doesn&#39;t know she is having it. She says 6 days after the first dose she started to feel ill, she had been in bed reading so she got up to get some water and suddenly felt like something was wrong and like she was going to pass out, she couldn&#39;t breathe, so she called EMS. She says her atrial fibrillation is not unusual, but she has never had it to where she couldn&#39;t breath. She says that the rate they estimated was 350, and her only other documented that was high like that was 150. She says that they treated her and she went home, and when she saw her cardiologist they said they don&#39;t know if the vaccine had to do with this, and to report it. She says a week later, on Friday a week ago, she started feeling funny standing while she was working on the computer in the middle of the afternoon, she felt like her ears were vibrating, which was very unusual, and she didn&#39;t know what was wrong so she looked at her Cardia app, and her heart was in normal sinus, and she checked her blood pressure which for her was sky high, up to 190/100 which her blood pressure is usually very low. She provided a second blood pressure that call handler was unable to capture and caller did not clarify as she no longer had her log with her. She says for hours her blood pressure (BP) went up and down, which was a similar or same thing as what happened that night she went to the ER with her atrial fibrillation, her BP would go up and down like riding a wave. She says needless to say, she has two questions: she says she doesn&#39;t know if there have been reports of that vaccine making A-fib worse, she is scared to get her second dose which she was supposed to get Monday a week ago, but put off primarily before the second thing with BP, she thought she would wait because she could hardly move her left arm so she put it off until the next Wednesday, She says that her second dose is now scheduled for 03Mar, so 4 weeks between doses, and she is a little afraid to get it because she doesn&#39;t know if her response was over the top or caused the other things, going to the ER with A-fib was terrifying, and she doesn&#39;t want that to happen again. She says people say that she has got to get her second dose because she won&#39;t be protected, so she would also like to know if it is possible for her to get antigens early on. She says that she had a tetanus shot 40 years ago, and had a horrible reaction after it, then years later they did a titer for tetanus and they said she would likely never need a tetanus shot again since she had built up such a high level and would never need it again. She says is it possible that she had enough immunity that she wouldn&#39;t need the second dose, or would there be an antigen test that could tell her if she would need a second dose, if so what is that test? She says she is afraid the next dose will kill her. AE treatment included says that when she went to the ER it was about 12:30AM when she arrived, they did not admit her. She says on the way to the ER in the EMS truck they gave her Cardiozyme to get her blood pressure going down and gave her 1000 cc fluids, and Metoprolol, another dose. She says that the Cardiozyme was IV push in the ambulance, she doesn&#39;t have the information to provide for all of the heart stuff they gave her, NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown for Metoprolol or Cardiozyme. She clarifies that she takes Metoprolol normally every day that they have had her on that is extended release and she takes it at night. She says she had taken that at 09:30PM, and by the time she got there to the ER after midnight a little, they after gave her another to see if it would bring her heart rate down. She says that they kept her there a couple of hours, until her heart rate was normal, though her BP was up a bit. She says that they told her they could admit her but she said she would rather go home if they thought it was safe, and she went home. She says that her sister came home and stayed with her, whose husband is a cardiothoracic surgeon. Metoprolol: Caller says that the Metoprolol she is taking is in a pharmacy bottle that says use by 08Feb2022, it does not have an official label, the NDC or LOT are not on there. She says that they gave her 60 to take of regular Metoprolol, not extended release, which is 25mg to take twice a day by mouth, so 60 tabs and she would need to get refills as it is a months worth. Metoprolol extended release NDC/LOT/EXP not provided when queried. She clarifies that the not extended release is called Toprol/Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg. Caller says that her swelling lymph node limited the use of her arm, she can&#39;t pick up anything or lift her self up while moving in the bed, she is miserable, it hurts to put pressure on her arm and she can hold her arm up and move it around she can do anything with not holding anything, she feels a tightness there, even when she breathes or coughs. She says her left arm was sore initially for 3-4 days after getting the shot but the soreness left. She says she was told on 03Feb that she had swollen lymph nodes, which was two days after the shot, but she couldn&#39;t feel them then, she couldn&#39;t tell, and had no pain. She says it was two weeks later that happened, it was so odd that it was two weeks before it was hurting then got progressively worse. Caller says that Tuesday a week ago she thought she must have done weights with her arms since her muscles were sore, but it was only on one side and she hadn&#39;t done any exercise since after she went to the ER she was being careful what she did, and she thought she strained her arm and realized what it was, it has gotten progressively worse over the last week. She says last night she started looking up remedies, she has been putting ice on it, and the clinic said use warm, and she rubbed castor oil on it last night in the shower then this morning she massaged her arm with castor oil and put a warm wash cloth over it. She says that castor oil has anti inflammatory properties. She says she has not noticed a difference yet, but she has only done it two times. She says it also said she can take Aleve or Ibuprofen, they told her at the ER, they also started her on Eliquis the night she was there, which she had never been on, they didn&#39;t consider her A-f fib bad enough. She says that is what has her concerned, she got the shot then 6 days later A-fib made her feel like she couldn&#39;t breathe. She says also her BP and heart rate going back up made her sick to her stomach that subsided when her BP was coming down but then it started going back up again, when she went to the ER that Saturday night on the 6th but by the time she got there it was the 7th.

The dizziness somewhat passed within 40 minutes but not totally, same with slight pain at base of tongue left side. Went to bed as normal but awoke to having great difficulty breathing as soft tissue around entire neck was swollen as were lymph glands around neck area, that was pressing against my airway making it seem like I was suffocating slowly, being strangled by all the swelling. Hospital injected me with mega dose cocktail of large amount of steroids, Benadryl.  Symptoms subsided quite a bit at hospital only to keep continuing for nearly 2 weeks after. Because of this on Tues March 2, 2021 I had an appointment with my family doctor because the swelling was still quite intense. She put me on a 3-5 day dose of Prednisone.  I still have some swelling going on in my neck area from it today 3/20/21.  On item 21 I clicked Permanent damage as I&#39;m unsure if this swelling will be permanent and continue to come and go at this time or totally subside eventually. It&#39;s unknown at this time.

                                                hives; face swelling; itching; rash; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 71-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EH9899), intramuscular in left arm on 22Dec2020 11:08 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing blood pressure high, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing depression. Concomitant medication included atenolol (tablet, strength 50 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for blood pressure high, simvastatin (tablet, strength 20 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for cholesterol, paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL, tablet, strength 40 mg) from an unknown date and ongoing for depression. The patient experienced hives, face swelling, itching and rash on 27Dec2020. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Prior vaccination within 4 weeks was none. She got the first Covid 19 dose on 22Dec2020 and was fine, then on 27Dec2020 she had hives, itching, and face swelling for several days. Caller stated her lungs were clear and she was okay other than the extreme itching. The face swelling was what worried her. The hives and itching went away within about 36 hours. The face swelling kind of got worse for a couple of days before it went away. Caller verifies she recovered from the hives/rash/itching within 36 hours. She got a steroid shot and things like that and it went away pretty quickly. The face swelling was completely gone but did last for a good 5 days. She didn&#39;t know if this reaction was related to the vaccine. She wanted to call and let Pfizer know and see if there was any reports of anything else like that or similar to that type of reaction. She was not sure if that really matters or not except she was not sure about taking the booster. She was kind of leaning towards taking the second vaccine. She didn&#39;t have any breathing issues. She asked as far as the second dose after those side affects, was it recommended? Her doctor said she could get the second one and prescribed her an Epi pen and would give a dose of Benadryl at the time of the second vaccine. She may take some Benadryl before getting the second vaccine and have her EpiPen with her just in case. She hadn&#39;t seen her doctor about this experience with the COVID-19 vaccine. She only went to an urgent care. The caller stated she went to urgent care twice. She received a steroid shot but doesn&#39;t have any name, NDC/UPC, Lot number or expiration date for any of the medication she received. She probably threw that paperwork out. She knew she wasn&#39;t given anything the second time she went to the urgent care. The second time she went back was because the face swelling was getting worse. She was prescribed an EpiPen and was told to take Zyrtec which did help. Everything had gone away. She would consider these events to be medically significant because of the face swelling, it kind of scared her. She made the comment she was taking high blood pressure medicine and cholesterol medicine, but other than that she was very healthy. She was not really an allergic person. She had not had any testing done since she received the vaccine. She did have bloodwork done prior but not since the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood work prior vaccine with unknown result. The outcome of hives, rash and itching was recovered on an unspecified date of Dec2020 (within about 36 hours); face swelling was recovered on 01Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the time gap between the vaccine and the events there is not a reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to the suspect product,  events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

She thinks it was anxiety/panic attack after receiving her vaccine as the tightness/SOB only lasted a few seconds.    She was walked by an RN from the vaccine administration area to observation area and took a set VS. VS were normal with a slightly elevated SBP.   Pt stayed in observation area for a little longer to make sure she felt okay. Pt went home, declined ED visit

                                                I felt fine while monitored in the parking lot for 15 minutes following injection. On my way home at 25 minutes post injection I had an over-all body wave-type feeling (somewhat similar to a sustained hot-flash) and over-all disconcertingly odd feeling. This lasted about 4 minutes and was followed by shakiness that lasted about 5 minutes (total time a bit less than 10 minutes). Took my bp, pulse, O2 as soon as I got home (approximately 5 minutes post symptoms) and the readings were fine.

                                                Very tired after vaccination.  Went to sleep about 8 PM Sat 1/16 and slept most of the next 4 days.  Stomach  was queasy.  Unable to drink coffee.  Tried to push fluids and tried to just eat bland foods.  Would wake up sporadically but was unable to awaken enough to watch an entire TV show. Pretty lethargic and brain fog.  Was able to wake up a little more on Wed 1/20 but still had the queasy stomach.  Started getting Headache and Eye pain and severe upper leg  and lower back burning &amp; cramping, I tried taking tylenol which helped a little.  By Thursday  the pain was worse.  I was still tired  only walking helped the pain. It got worse if I sat down and extremely bad if I laid down to try to sleep. It&#39;s Friday morning &amp; I am planning to go to med check this AM.  Symptoms still ongoing

Blood pressure top number was 175, ten minutes later it dropped to 155. Staff member stated my pulse was elevated. Although, I only felt the slight tightness in my throat. My oxygen level stayed at 98. They had me stay for an hour and then I went home. By then the tightness started to lessen. After an hour or two the feeling was total gone. My blood pressure had gone back to normal when I checked it at home. The next day at 2 pm [13 hours later] I had a temperature of 99.1, had the chills yet felt warm, started a slight headache and became very tired. At 2 am in the morning everything was over. I woke at my normal time and felt great. Have been doing well ever since.

No relevant medical history and concomitant medications were provided. On 22Jan2021, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction. She went to the doctor and he was reluctant to give her steroids which was the normal way of treating the anaphylactic reactions because he said that the steroid would interfere with the effect of the vaccine. So, he gave her diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL). She had to go back to the emergency room later that day and they used epinephrine (EPIPEN) and she had to have an intravenous (IV) and other than that some medications, it had prednisolone in it. Then she had to go back yesterday and she had another IV and they sent her home with an EPIPEN. The event was assessed serious as medically significant. The patient had recovered from the event in Jan2021.

A 71-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number EL8982), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 (at the age of 71-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination and started to receive methotrexate (ACCORD HEALTHCARE, lot number unknown, expiration date 12Nov2021) on an unspecified date (reported as seven years ago) at a dose of 17.5 mg weekly (seven tablets once a week) for Rheumatoid Arthritis. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis from an unspecified date. Historical vaccinations included &#34;every vaccine known. I&#39;ve had all my vaccines, flu whatever&#34;  (as reported) on unspecified dates. It was unknown if the patient had received any other vaccinationa in the fourteen days prior to this inoculation. Concomitant medications included folic acid (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). On 18Jan2021 (reported as about five days after the shot), the patient had just a little soreness and she thought that was one of the side effects that you have that with the vaccine. So, she didn&#39;t worry so much about it. But then it got progressively worse. And by the time just before she was supposed to get the second shot, it was really bad. But she thought that she was still going to get that second shot which was planned for &#34;02Feb2021 or 03Feb2021&#34; (also reported as on 02Feb2021) because she didn&#39;t want to not get it.  She was struggling with the pain before she got the second one. She mentioned that by the time she got her second dose, she was in an RA flare. She continued by saying that she had her blood work done, &#34;on Tuesday morning&#34;  because she was due for her RA exam in Mar and it was due, and her markers for ESR, and &#34;CR whatever&#34;  were more than double what they should be. Her Rheumatololgist saw her and when she went to the doctor her shoulders, her ankles, her elbows and everything were all hot with flare ups. Treatment included Prednisone 10mg every day which was given, according to the patient,  in order to &#34;calm down my joints and everything.&#34; The action taken with methotrexate was not reported. The clinical outcomes Rheumatoid Arthritis flare up, pain, condition aggravated, ESR increased and CRP increased were reported as unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Rheumatoid arthritis flare up, ESR increased, and CRP increased cannot be excluded.

After receiving the second vaccine, I sneezed and had a constantly runny/blocked nasal passages for almost 24 hours.  It was a long night.  I must have sneezed more than 100 times.  Never had anything like this before in my life. about 10 AM the following day it simply stopped as fast as it started and has not reoccurred.  I received the Pfizer vaccine. Had muscle/joint aches but nothing that happened was a big deal

                                                This patient started to feel lightheaded and had a dry mouth approximately 5 minutes after receiving her Pfizer mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Over the next 20 to 25 minutes she progressed to having a sensation of tongue swelling, then difficulty swallowing, then chest tightness.  Her vital signs were stable throughout the observation period (blood pressure 144/74 and 150/70, pulse in the high 80s to low 90s, and oxygen saturation 96-98% on room air) and she was able to speak in full sentences without any respiratory distress.  Her lungs were clear and she had no stridor.  She never had any pruritic symptoms or rash/hives.  Because of the progressive nature of her symptoms, however, I felt she needed emergency room evaluation for observation.  We never administered any medication while at the vaccine clinic including epinephrine or Benadryl.  After approximately 25 minutes, 911 was called and she was transported by ambulance to the emergency room in stable condition.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 71-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: E13247) via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 11:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included A-fib. Concomitant medication included apixaban (ELIQUIS). Had COVID-19 Vaccine on 19Jan2021 and everything was fine. Had a headache and a little bit of malaise on 20Jan2021. After two days was ok. On 21Jan2021, broke out in what she thinks was shingles. Not 100% sure if it was a major rash or shingles. Wanted to know if that was a possible side effect. Patient was taking Valaciclovir (VALTREX) for Shingles. Doctor suspected it was shingles, but it was possible she had shingles brewing before the COVID-19 Vaccine or the COVID-19 Vaccine brought the shingles out. Second COVID-19 Vaccine is scheduled for 09Feb2021, patient was scared and afraid of it. Doesn&#39;t know what to do. On 20Jan2021 she was very tired and had a headache. Next day was ok. On 21Jan2021 thought she had bug bites. Started itching. Then it began traveling and she realized it was not bug bites. She started experiencing burning. Went to two Urgent Care and her Internist. Was told it was basically shingles. Her internist was on the fence because she just had the COVID-19 Vaccine and wasn&#39;t certain. Caller stated it was ironic that she broke out after the vaccine. Caller&#39;s internist stated for any rash it would be treated the same with Valtrex. Internist stated chances were the rash was viral so if it&#39;s not shingles, would be treated with Valtrex. Rash and Itching: Wasn&#39;t very bad on Saturday, 23Jan2021, which was the first time she had someone look at it. On Sunday, 24Jan2021 it was full blown and really blossomed. Was initially treating rash as if it was bug bites. Was applying Benadryl tropical. On Sunday, 24Jan2021, started taking Valtrex. Outcome of the events headache, malaise, fatigue was recovered on n unspecified date, while unknown for the other events.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EK9231, via an unspecified route of administration in left shoulder on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the COVID-19 vaccine on Monday (11Jan2021). On Tuesday (12Jan2021), she experienced back pain that occurs in her left leg past the knee until the top of her foot. She also mentioned that she had other problems before taking the COVID-19 vaccine such as joint pain, muscle pain, back pain, and spinal stenosis. She wanted to know if the COVID-19 vaccine can cause the adverse event that she experienced. She wanted to know if it is like a sciatic nerve pain she is experiencing. The patient stated it may sound crazy, but she got the COVID 19 vaccine on Monday, she is 72 years old, and has a lot of back issues, like sciatic has a lot of problems, and she got the shot and Tuesday) morning, her back hurt so bad, down into her sciatic, into her butt, leg, her lower leg and as far as her foot, the top of her foot, and she doesn&#39;t know if this is something that was going to happen, she read about joint pain, tiredness, that would include joints in the back, she would expect. She wonders if she is out of her head, since it was the very next morning, this was Tuesday, and instantly, she was sitting with ice and trying to get ahold of her healthcare person, she gets pain shots in her back, but she hasn&#39;t had them in a couple years, she was going along pretty good, then this was bad enough, it is in her thigh and leg, and is always under her foot, and she just thought it was swelling in her spine. She wonders if it is a side effect or her imagination. When asked for address, the patient stated her brain is going blank. She stated this may be just her. She has bad back problems, and was going along pretty good, it has been a year or two since she has had any kind of anything. But this was a good one, a strong one, the ice hurts so bad. She woke up with it, it is staying the same- after having something like this, she was trying to get ahold of the pain clinic, to get a shot, but that may be 3-4 weeks out. She has had no blood work in a while. Outcome of the events &#34;she just thought it was swelling in her spine&#34; and &#34;her brain is going blank&#34; was unknown; while not recovered for other events.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid 19 vaccine, lot number EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 14-JAN-2021 at the 72 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The medical history included COPD so sometimes she would cough, kidney stent, rheumatoid (&#34;two&#34; Tylenol and 20 mg prednisone for &#34;her rheumatoid&#34;). The concomitant medication was clarithromycin (MACROBID) from an unspecified date to 12Jan2021. The patient got it on the 14Jan2021. She says she had been doing fine she didn&#39;t know now. She was a retired paramedic so she usually felt things out, she got it Thursday and that night she noticed a little itching on 14Jan2021 but she did not think anything of it. Friday evening she had a good time eating some walnuts and she woke up about 2:30 itching that was Saturday morning before day, she took Benadryl and went back to sleep later then later on she was itching a little again in the palm of her hands and she just took a Benadryl and it went away. Then Sunday night, last night, she was okay so she decided to go to the pharmacy to get some Benadryl, they had no Benadryl and she only had old Benadry. Then about 12:30 she started itching on her bottom, itching on her arms and she was scratching. She noticed she was having some face soreness in Jan2021 but she was using some expired facial cream so she thought that was why her face was sore so she put some hydrocortisone cream on it. Since she was itching she decided to take a little of her nieces Benadryl, it is pediatric Benadryl. She was itching so she called her doctor and she heard him in the ER say they had too many people in there to tell her to go to the ER so she said okay. She hung up and called the pharmacy and they said it sounds like having an allergic reaction in Jan2021 and she told him she had the COVID vaccine but she doesn&#39;t think she was short of breath and she gave them her vitals her BP was 152/85(BP 157/85) that was high for her in Jan2021, but it came down, she took some Tylenol then it was 146/77, her pulse rate was 77 and her respirations were good she did not have shortness of breath or cough well she has COPD so sometimes she would cough. Then she got up and said let me go one over and get some Benadryl so she went by there got some good Benadryl and she thought she would call and see what they think about all this. She took the Benadryl at 10:25 and she is doing okay right now but she had whelps, she has to got the rash on her behind where she has been scratching in Jan2021, it is on the left side of her hip, the cellulitis part of her skin that is mostly where she is itching in Jan2021. She remembers when she worked at the health department they would give Benadryl and Prednisone. She thought if the Benadryl does not help then she would call, then she decided she would go ahead and call to see what information they have. She says Pfizer is giving her alerts that she has been answering but she did not have the itching at that time. She retired from being a paramedic in 2009. She says she is 72 now but she woke up in 1985 and her lip was swollen like not totally swollen but her top lip was swollen more than the bottom in Jan2021. They gave her an Epinephrine shot and Benadryl and she is just wondering if this itching is related to the vaccine or if it is just an allergy that she may have come up on or something like to the walnuts or something. She says they went there and they gave the shot and they gave Benadryl but they are not sure. She said the doctor never figured our what it was that cause it and it never happened again until she did notice a little puffiness on her lip again this morning. She said the itching first started around 2:34 AM in the morning before light. It had improved since taking up to date Benadryl. She was supposed to get her second dose 04Feb2021. She didn&#39;t want COVID 19. She knew she just came off, she had a kidney stent and she had stopped taking 2 days before, she was taking Macrobid. She was not taking that right now. She took a lot of other medications but the Macrobid she was just on and it was stopped on Tuesday 12Jan2021, 2 days before the vaccine. She didn&#39;t know if the Macrobid would interfere with getting vaccine. The outcome of the event itching was recovering, the other events was unknown.

A 72-year-old female received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), second dose on 28Jan2021, 11:00 AM (lot number:EL3249), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm at single dose for COVID-19 immunization in Doctor&#39;s office/urgent care. The patient medical condition included right Bundle Branch Block, cardiac from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no known allergies. The patient concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL) and Upgraid. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in the left arm on 06Jan2021, 02:00PM (lot number: EL3249) at the age of 72 years for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested after the vaccination for covid-19. Twenty-four hours after vaccine received, on 29Jan2021 at 03:00 PM, the patient suddenly lost ability to speak intelligibly. The patient stated &#34;I was completely aware though a little &#34;foggy&#34;. Blood pressure 170/84. Friend present thought I was having a TIA and called 911. Ambulance came.  Within 25 minutes, my ability to speak returned slowly. By the time I got to the ER, (45 minutes after onset), my ability to speak had mostly returned.&#34; Many blood labs were drawn, CT of head done, MRI of head done. EKG done. No cause of incident or evidence of TIA seen. After 5 hours, the patient was discharged with orders to come back if symptoms reoccurred. The patient had a headache, scratchy throat, fatigue and body aches in 2021. Since then the patient had a variety of tests, labs and Dr. visits. Blood pressure has been higher than her normal of 120/80, at intervals during the day in 2021. Since no evidence of TIA has been found, the patient was wondering if there have been any other reports of this loss of speaking ability (aphasia) occurring with any other vaccine recipients. The patient received treatment for the events. The consumer considered the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 23Jan2021 at a single dose, in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included fibromyalgia diagnosed years ago, angina (some stents). There were no concomitant medications. On Jan2021, the patient experienced angina, fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny nose, nausea, diarrhea, headache, arm heavy, muscle aches and heaviness, and she just woke up feeling sick. The patient experienced multiple AEs after 1st dose of vaccine (received on 23Jan2021). The patient experienced angina later last week. Clinical course: The patient has misplaced card, states her second appointment for the second dose is this Saturday. Caller stated she started having these experiences the day after she was vaccinated with her first dose, received first dose of 23Jan2021. She had fevers, chills, cough- not an aggressive cough, a funny kind of sore throat- like something wrapped around her throat like the muscles of her throat, no congestion but does have a runny nose, states she has some nausea, no vomiting but feeling like she needed to vomit and diarrhea, and headache. The symptoms started about the third day after the vaccine, started with the fevers, stated the fevers may come like a hot flash, lasts seconds even, states you know it is a fever because your bones get hot. These symptom&#39;s did not attack her body at one time. Her whole arm stayed heavy, the whole arm not just the injection site, for almost 10 whole days. She previously had fibromyalgia and thought maybe that made the symptoms worse. She had muscle aches and feeling heavy. Her symptoms were spread out over time, no two were at the same time, sore throat was one of the last things. Diarrhea was ongoing, not a runny diarrhea but it was enough to empty stomach and was soft. She was a medic in the military, worked as a Nurse, clarifies she was an LPN and took all the underlying courses to be a PA. One of the issues she found, she thought it may be deadly, as a prior healthcare person and in tune to her body, the people who are in the nursing homes may not be mobile, states so one of the things she felt was just feeling really really sick, that she couldn&#39;t put a pin point on it, states she just woke up feeling sick, states she had the urge to get out of bed and got up and after she got up the feeling left her, states a person in the nursing home may just feel really bad and cannot get up, thinks a protocol should be that the people that are immobile should be required to move or if they can&#39;t get up they need to move their muscles, people with these symptoms need to get up and get moving. She also has history of angina and a stent, has not had angina in a while and had 3 days where she thought she may need to go talk to her doctor. It was on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday this week. States one of her friends, 92 years old, said she got high after the vaccine and didn&#39;t want to talk to anybody, states it was her first dose, she was kind of leery about the 2nd shot, feels like this was kind of aggressive. She had both doses and had no symptoms, but 92-year-old female had no symptoms right away, other than normal body aches and pains, but the next day was high as a kite. Her son has heart disease and she advised him not to take it right now. They were losing a lot of people to the vaccine in nursing homes, no further information provided. This could be affecting good hearts more than damaged hearts, read that this virus likes to work in parts of the body that are already damaged. The outcome of event diarrhea was not recovered, outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information provided, a causal association between the reported angina and BNT162B2 cannot be completely excluded. Note however, that the patient has underlying angina with some stents that may also have contributed to the event. Case will be re-assess once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Upon my evaluation she is stable but begins to cough.  She has moderate posterior pharyngeal irritation as well.  She has been monitored.  Chest x-ray is reassuring.  The present do not think labs are necessary.  She is been advised to monitor her symptoms at home and return for any concerns.  I recommended Benadryl as well as short course of prednisone.  She has received prednisone here and advised her to take prednisone tomorrow and then discuss additional doses with her primary doctor control

This consumer reported similar event for two patients. This is the first of 2 reports.  A 72-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration at the right upper arm close to the shoulder on 02Feb2021 07:30 at single dose as she doesn&#39;t want to get COVID again or give COVID to anyone else. Medical history included metabolic syndrome from 1994 and ongoing, it all started when she was 46 and it runs in her family and it was a genetic thing; ongoing diabetes mellitus, was diagnosed when she was 65, so 7 years ago; she had COVID in Nov2020 but it was just a very mild case and she just had a cough; and cardio artery problems. She takes a lot of medications and she has metabolic syndrome which includes cardio artery problems and diabetes, but she has taken all of those medications for a long time. The patient says she was calling to report a couple little concerns she has. She received her shot on Tuesday, 02Feb2021 at about 7:30 in morning and her arm started at about 2 to 3 in the afternoon and she noticed it was getting sore, but it was no big deal, she did not think anything of it, and on the second day she thought that was it and she was over it on 03Feb2021. She states her husband also mentioned that he had soreness in his arm after his vaccination. She says at three in the afternoon on 03Feb2021, she started feeling weak and shaky, but she didn&#39;t think much of that. She says this began around 3 to 4 when yesterday afternoon, 03Feb2021, she had a fever. She says she took her temperature and it was 100.4 and that all kind of was gone by the evening but when she woke up this morning, she was weak and shaky again. Today she got up and was weak and shaky and it never left, she was still weak and shaky. The patient mentions that she was diabetic so she can get weak and shaky when she needs to eat something, but she had just eaten, and she ate yesterday so she doesn&#39;t think it was caused by that. The patient says she thinks we should know that she was diabetic. She says then she could tell that she had a fever, so she took her temperature and it was 100.4 which for her was high. She states she didn&#39;t even have a fever when she had COVID. The fever began yesterday afternoon (03Feb2021). She says her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever and they felt that way so that&#39;s why she took her temperature. This was the highest it has been in years. She says last night she took her temperature again and the fever had gone away in 30 to 40 minutes, so she thought it was over. She took her temperature again before she called this morning, 04Feb2021 and it was 99.2, which was still a little hot for her. She says for her that&#39;s a fever. She was 96 and 97 usually. The patient says she still feels like she has a little fever. She was not someone who usually has a fever and it can be just a little bit of a fever for instance like this morning when she was 99.2. Her eyes were still feeling funny and burning this morning and that was why she took her temperature this morning. The outcome of the event arm was a little sore was recovered on 03Feb2021; feeling weak and shaky was not recovered; fever and her eyes start feeling funny and burning when she has a fever was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021162089 Same reporter/drug, similar event, different patient

A 72-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9265) via an unspecified route of administration on 18Feb2021 08:45 a.m. at the age of 72 years old, at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccine was received in four weeks. No COVID prior vaccination, no COVID tested post vaccination. Medical history included Parkinson&#39;s. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin, carbidopa, flecainide, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), and metoprolol succinate (TOPROL), all taken for unspecified indication from an unspecified date. The patient previously took codeine and experienced &#34;allergies: Codeine&#34;, dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride (DARVON) and experienced &#34;allergies: darvon&#34;.

A 72-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number=EL3249), intramuscular on the right arm, at the age of 72 years, on 13Jan2021 09:45 at a SINGLE  DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included food allergy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient would like to know if the vaccine was derived from or does it have any products from Acacia. One of the reason&#39;s she was asking was because she knows it has Polyethylene Glycol in it. Her resources are limited. She was a retired healthcare provider and she taught graduate level nursing and has background in epidemiology and public health. The Polyethylene Glycol was in the vaccine, according to the prescribing information. Some forms of Polyethylene Glycol in some type of way are derived from gum acacia and she does not know if this is the case for the COVID vaccine. She did have 1st dose and waited 15 minutes. When her left eye felt tight and felt itchy, she took 2 Benadryl and then waited in car a little longer. She felt like she was going to go into what she has had in past 3-4 times relating to fish. She has had full blown facial swelling, intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch. Those times, if she had chopsticks, she would want to scratch inside her ear. She never had that with the COVID vaccine. They told her when she got the vaccine that if this develops further, she should go to her doctor or ER, but should not come back there. She did not want to go to the ER and sit there for 12 hours waiting to see if she was going to have a worse reaction, so she went home, took 2 more Benadryl, and went to bed. Eight hours later, she was fine and did not have hives. She then stated she completed report with Pfizer online and did not have a reference number for previous report. For those time when she had these episodes with the fish, she had extreme itching and hives. The worst allergy she had, her fingers looked like they were webbed. She was treated with Adrenaline, Cortisone and Benadryl by injection and that would usually stop the reaction, but it usually takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down. In later years, if there is a piece of fish mixed in with fried shrimp and she inadvertently eats it, she knows it immediately. She will take Benadryl immediately. She will have facial swelling and swelling around her eyes. The Benadryl will contain it. She will be disfigured for 2 weeks, with bags of fluid in her cheeks. She is going for her second shot tomorrow. She can self treat with Benadryl. In 1994, she had a very positive wheels from an intradermal scratch testing for Acacia and codfish. The patient had an onset of burning and itching, periorbital. She took 2 25 mg Benadryl tablets. She has itching in ears and throat. After my 15 minutes waiting, she left. She had various hot spots of burning skin, legs and arms. Left eye felt like past episodes of itching, about to swell. Her skin had feeling of about to break out in hives. Facility said to go to provider or ER if got worse. She chose not to go to ER, and wait and be miserable for hours on end, while waiting for full blown body hives all over. She took two more 25 mg Benadryl and went to bed. She had intermittent burning skin, various areas, for several hours. About 8 hours later, was resolved. The patient was about to receive 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine. After the 1st dose she experienced an itchy feeling in throat, rotating heat in arms and legs, slight bag fluid under left eye and it felt to her like she was going to have an allergic reaction but did not. She took some Benadryl and after 8 hours she was fine. The patient stated after the first dose of the vaccine she had itching, severe tightness in her left eye that felt like it was going to swell up, and hot skin for several hours. She took two Benadryl while she was still in the waiting period and perhaps that blunted the reaction. She had hot flashes on the drive home. She took two more Benadryl at her daughter house (100mg total after taking 4 that day). She didn&#39;t feel good and felt she was on the verge of getting hives. She had episodes of hot skin and itching and after 8 hours it was over and done with and she was fine. She stated she is nervous about the second dose but stated they have what they need if she has an immediate reaction and it is worth the risk of getting vaccinated.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of left eye felt tight and felt itchy/severe tightness in her left eye (eye pruritus), intense itching in inner ear where you cannot scratch (ear pruritus), onset of burning and itching (skin burning sensation), skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over (urticaria). The outcome of the event onset of burning and itching and skin had feeling of about to break out in hives/full blown body hives all over was recovered on an unspecified date while other events were unknown.

                                                I am reporting the below as everything written has NEVER happened to me before in my 72 years of living.  This has all taken place since I have had the Vaccine Injection on Wednesday, February 24th.  I am attributing all of this as a possible reaction to the vaccine or maybe coincidence.  I wanted to report what has taken place so you all can assess if this is a possible adverse reaction, a direct effect from the vaccine or just coincidence. Please let me know if anything like this has been reported and what your thoughts about the matter.  Wednesday, February 24th 11:15am Pfizer Vaccine right arm ?about an hour later discomfort on shot side that went from the shoulder up the right side of the neck.  Was gone by next day. Thursday, February 25th Day seemed to be normal.  When I went to bed that evening a pressure and pounding on the left top side of the head, on the part line.  Lasted 5-6 hours and then went away for that episode. Friday, February 26th  Day started off OK, walked 2 miles and then ran some errands.   *3:00pm I bent down to pick up something and when I came up I had extreme light headedness like I have never had before.  I was able to get myself collected and then continued to get ready to go out.   *6:00pm I just sat in a chair in the restaurant and BAM the room started spinning at about 500 miles (that is the speed that it felt like) an hour.  My arms were flailing as I was trying to grab something to old onto.   Just when I was about to fall off of the chair my husband walked up and grabbed me as he could see that something was going on and he said that I was white as a sheet.   Once I got somewhat collected, I knew immediately that I had to throw up.  My husband took me to the restroom.  I had severe dry heaves that just would not stop.  I wasn?t breathing properly so my hands and feet were numb, tingly and very white in color.  Then I had to have a bowel movement.  We phoned for the ambulance to take me to the hospital jus to make sure that I did not have a stroke, or it was my heart, or a vessel had burst in the head.  The Paramedic tested me for a stroke and I passed the test.    *8:00pm or so I had another episode with room going around at top speed and I started having dry heaves.  Nurse gave me medicine in the IV for nausea.  My Doctor said that everything was Benign.  He said that the CT patient scan was negative and all other tests were OK. Saturday, February 27th I was released from the hospital and went home.  I did very little that day.  I slept that night from 10:00pm until 10:00am the next day. Sunday, February 28th I was lightheaded, had a headache, and ears ringing all day.  I just did not feel myself at all. Tuesday, March 9th Around noon I had a severe lightheadedness/spinning episode, eyes felt like they were spinning.  Laid down for about 2 hours and when I got up I was able to function and the spinning had gotten better.  Headache all night long, ears ringing, feeling of lightheadedness. Wednesday, March 10th  Not quite as dizzy, headache all day, back of neck and left side of head sore to touch.  Pounding on left top side of head ? along the part line, where I had the same discomfort the 2nd day after the vaccine. Thursday, March 11th Having discomfort on left side of head.  To the right of the left ear, going   down to the neck. I can touch those areas and add to the discomfort. Friday, March 12th  On Monday, March 7th I noticed a red spot on the right side behind where I was given the injection.  I tried to treat it myself but my remedies were not helping.  Contacted my Dermatologist on Thursday, March 11th.  She saw me today, Friday, March 12th.  She is not sure if it is a possible aftermath of the vaccine or something else.  Had some bloodwork run to rule how Shingles.  Prescribed some medication for Shingles to take until Monday when the bloodwork report is due for review.  Blood work was negative for Shingles.   Ever since the episode on February 26th I have NOT felt myself at all.  Lightheaded, nausea, headache, pressure in head and feels heavy, not steady on my feet, discomfort in back of head near neckline, on/off discomfort in the top of the head with a pounding force.  BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW HIGHER THAN NORMAL ESPECIALLY WITH BOTTOM NUMBER BEING HIGH.  I have never had a Blood Pressure problem, although as I have aged the top number has elevated but not enough to take medicine.  However, the lower number is now elevated (high 80-?s, low mid range 90?s) and Cardiologist is going to make a decision on whether I should start on a low dose medicine. I am to take my 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow ? Wednesday, March 17th at 11:00am.   Thank You for reviewing the above writings.  I look forward to the conclusion VAERS makes on my situation.

A 73-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: SL3246), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 12Jan2021 at 10:45, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took varicella zoster vaccine (SHINGLES VACCINE) for immunization and had a little reaction but just the normal things. On Tuesday morning, the patient got the COVID-19 shot and was fine. This morning (15Jan2021), the patient was not feeling great, has a slight headache, her breathing is heavier, and below her breast line is a tightness she can&#39;t really describe. The patient asked if these were a side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine and wondering if this is normal. As a treatment for the events, the patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient asked if she can or should get a test, a COVID-19 test. It has been so many days since having the vaccine, 4 days later, she is wondering if she might have COVID-19. The patient isn&#39;t sure and is just asking a question. It is confirmed that she has not had a test or tested positive for COVID-19. The outcome of &#34;Not feeling great&#34; was unknown. The patient had not recovered from the remaining events.

A 73-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number: EL1283) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 10Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There was no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the first dose of the vaccine on 10Jan2021 and didn&#39;t have a reaction, but had a slight pain in her arm on 10Jan2021. Her sore arm started on 11Jan2021. There was a sore spot and when she would pick up her arm it was sore and achy. No pain, but sore and achy. It lasted for a day or two. She didn&#39;t have any symptoms until Saturday the 16Jan2021, this past Saturday she thought she was dying. She had chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and had a headache. She thought she was losing her mind. The headache just stopped today. She had the chills that would not stop and she thinks she broke the sweat on Sunday (17Jan2021). She had a little nausea and couldn&#39;t eat anything on 16Jan2021. She had a terrible headache, which just stopped about 2 hours ago. She stated she must have to take 10 Tylenol over the course of time, every 4 hours. On Saturday 16Jan2021 she was just laying on the floor in pain. She was not even eating, just drinking water. All of her symptoms stopped this morning around 5 AM (18Jan2021). She had a big sweat. She is unsure if she had a fever because she does not have a thermometer. She is unsure if she has recovered completely from these symptoms. She feels weak, and is still weak (on Jan2021). She cannot go out or get dressed or shower. She is not strong enough. She is just sitting up now, no longer laying in bed. She couldn&#39;t walk (on Jan2021) and was afraid she was going to faint on 16Jan2021. She can walk a little bit now and feels a little bit better. She has been out of it for three days, She hasn&#39;t felt good. She asked if side effects can appear 6 days later? Is this normal to have a reaction 1 week after getting it? She asked are the side effects worse after the second dose? She asked is this Covid or side effects, what are the COVID symptoms? She asked should she take the second one if she had these side effects? Caller clarifies this is the Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Whoever vaccinated her did not give her the paper about it afterwards. Her neighbor brought it to her cause they went together. She did not realize she could experience these things. She did not expect them a week after getting the vaccine. She thought she had COVID. She asks, &#34;do you think I have COVID?&#34; She is just now getting better and it has been 3 days of experiencing these symptoms. Should she get the second vaccine? She is trying to do the right thing. Event outcome of chills, nausea, feeling freezing cold, and headache was recovered on 18Jan2021, for was going to faint and couldn&#39;t walk was recovering, for weak was not recovered, while for others was unknown.

The injection site is sore but no rash; right arm seems to have &#34;phantom pain&#34; as well ( I experienced this with Shingles shot in December 2020 too).

Then Sunday (24Jan2021), she had a very bad experience, she went and start watching TV and she fell asleep. When she woke up, she didn&#39;t know what time, what date, nothing. And she looked at the time on her TV and it said 6:45, she didn&#39;t know if it was am or pm. And it was dark outside and she didn&#39;t know if it was Monday or Sunday. She was all confused, she called someone to make sure what day and time and all and still she was still confused.

And they took test and all and nothing, everything was okay. They couldn&#39;t find out why her whole leg was swollen. On top of that, they did chest x-ray and they did something else she can&#39;t remember, another test. And they took all kind of blood work and all. And they did to see if she had the virus, the COVID. And yesterday they called her from the hospital and they said that she didn&#39;t have the virus. And she asked them about the blood work and they told her if there was anything more than they would call her. So, she thinks all this came from that injection. She called because this was not guaranteed if this was from injection. When confirmed that COVID test was negative and blood work report was not out, she stated they haven&#39;t called her that meant her blood work was okay. The swollen leg has been gone down and blood once in a while she sees a little bit. They gave her 2 prescriptions, one was antibiotic and one is steroid. Due date for the next shot is 12Feb2021. The outcome of the events was recovering.

A 74-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 20Jan2021 at 9:30-9:45 am at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included exposure to radiation from 2017 to an unknown date and did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017). There were no concomitant medications. Historical vaccine included two doses of shingles vaccine (SHINGRIX) for Immunization and experienced shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain after the vaccine. The patient experienced bad headache (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, Severe shaking chills (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, muscles and joints ached (disability) on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, couldn&#39;t hold a cup to drink on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, painful bilateral lower back pain on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of recovered on 21Jan2021, cough/dry cough on 20Jan2021 17:00 with outcome of not recovered (reported as worsened), strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, taste started to diminish on 21Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, pharangitis on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, couldn&#39;t get warm on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown. Details were as follows: the patient received the COVIED in the morning of 20Jan2021. By 5pm she had developed a headache, severe shaking, chills, muscle and joints pain, severe lower back pain, and a dry cough; she was miserable. A few years ago after her double dosing of the shingles vaccine she had a similar reaction of shaking, chills, and muscle and joint pain. She has no product details for that product, no NDC, Lot, or expiry to provide. The patient confirmed that the shingles shot was 2 doses, not a double dose given at one time. When asked a seriousness criteria it was explained that the symptoms that started on the 20th, she felt they were disabling. She couldn&#39;t get warm, stop shaking, couldn&#39;t hold a cup and the pain was severe and she has high tolerance for pain. By around 3pm that day on the 21Jan2021 everything but the dry cough had resolved, and that had gotten worse. She also developed new symptoms. She had strange odor in her nose, like burning plastic and her sense of taste started to diminish. She did lose some of her sense taste due to 2 massive doses of radiation in 2017, She has no product information, NDC, Lot or Expiry for that radiation but after that she did have taste, some of it did come back. On the 21Jan2021, it was less, the sense of taste and now today she has no taste at all. For the muscle and joint pain she took Aleve. She was told if she was feeling worse over the weekend to go to the ER or urgent care. The patient was wondering and thinking this was her normal response to the vaccine just like she had a normal response that shingles vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

I was anxious as I have anxiety disorder! But my face was RED and TIRED looking. I asked staff what wrong. No swelling at that time! 4:40 PM.  That nite, my heart started POUNDING HARD all night, not stop. Ativan not help. I slept, weird dreams, wake up and still heart pounding.  8 am --- got up and hands, arms, extremities SWOLLEN!! Heart still pounding,  Felt like allergic to MSG or nitrates or preservatives or too much salt. Felt weird.. Not faint-- just weird. Tired from the pounding heart. Not fatigued.  I did have sore arm, but it was NOT an issue.  My hands, toes were red.

                                                I began feeling deeply fatigued and achy about six hours after the vaccination and went to bed.  The aches and fatigue continued the next day and evening and, additionally, I had a swelling in my left wrist of the arm that I had the shot in.  That swelling was painful; it  was about an inch across and looked like it contained fluid.  All those symptoms continued for two more days and then the swelling began to subside and is now gone..  Today, the morning of the fifth day after the vaccination, I awoke at 3 a.m. with severe body aches, took two Tylenol and eventually was able to sleep again.  I am feeling better but very, very tired and have some bodyaches and headache but not as severe.

A 75-year-old female received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number EJ1686), intramuscular in the left upper arm on 08Jan2021 at 15:45 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Leighten Plantar Alopecia (hair follicle is an enemy), skin infection (infection in body most of the time, at least on skin), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities, obesity, autoimmune disorder (diagnosed 8 months ago). She has lost some height, prior to taking the vaccine and she said it was related to age. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced feeling unwell on 10Jan2021; blood in urine on 10Jan2021 at 17:00; nausea at 10:00, chills at 11:00, almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office at 10:00, felt cold - all on 11Jan2021; getting really tired/fatigue on 14Jan2021 at 09:30; gets really sweaty on 13Jan2021 at 10:00; and dizziness on unknown date. The patient had the first shot on Friday (08Jan2021). On Sunday (10Jan2021), she started feeling bad. She was feeling good about getting it and had no reaction. She has an autoimmune disorder that made her a little afraid to take, but with all the indications, they said it would be much better for her to take it than to get the COVID virus. Sunday (10Jan2021), she does not feel good. So, she started having blood in urine. She thought she had a UTI and had not had one in 20 years. It felt like that is what she had and with the blood in urine. She just took Tylenol and waited until Monday morning because she does not like sitting in doctor&#39;s office. They gave her a cup to give sample and said she didn&#39;t need to see provider. They will have it checked and in the meantime call in a prescription. It kept getting worse and worse. She was about to passed out in the doctor&#39;s office on 11Jan2021, she got nauseous and almost threw up. She got in the car with her husband and he was trying to get her home. She got chills and got so cold and could not warm her body up. Her husband gave her Phenergan and it kind of knocked her out for a while to ease her nausea. She was thinking of going later today (14Jan2021), when she gets enough energy, to get a COVID test. She does not know if it will give false positive or not. She had chills and now she gets sweaty since 13Jan2021. She took her temperature and she did not have one. She just now got up. It is 10:00. She got up this morning (14Jan2021) and was really tired. She was not sweating this morning. Tiredness is kind of new, and when she talked to the nurse, she sort of felt like maybe it was a reaction to the COVID vaccine, but then she talked to her daughter and she said the symptoms she was having are usually symptoms that occur with second dose of the vaccine. It is not uncommon for people to have symptoms she was having. She wanted to know if she should have a COVID test. If she has had just one shot, would the test give a false positive coming from the COVID. They were asking if patient should take the second dose, and should she continue her UTI medication. Doctor&#39;s visit to give urine sample on 11Jan2021 (results: negative for UTI). She did not see a doctor though. They sent sample and prescribed a sulfa based medication for a UTI. She did start feeling a little better and stopped having blood in her urine. She plans to continue it because she does not like to stop taking an antibiotic. She did not have any clue that it was not a UTI until the nurse from her provider&#39;s office called to tell her results of urine sample was negative. Outcome of event getting really tired/fatigue was not recovered; events almost passed out at doctor&#39;s office, blood in urine, chills, and gets really sweaty was recovering; and unknown for other events.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Batch/lot number: EK5730) intramuscularly on arm left on 09Jan2021 10:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included heart problems from May1966 and ongoing (heart problems/She had open heart surgery at that time and had stents put in a couple of times since then), bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Concomitant medications were none. Patient used to receive unspecified injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient experienced heart pains in Jan2021, dizziness on 10Jan2021, not feeling quite right on 10Jan2021, severe chills on 11Jan2021, fever on 11Jan2021, nauseated in Jan2021, threw up in Jan2021, tiredness in Jan2021, muscle aches in Jan2021, a little swelling in her face in Jan2021, weakness in Jan2021. The outcome of the events was unknown. Patient received her first Pfizer vaccine on 09Jan2021. Patient explains she has had adverse reactions to the vaccine ever since she received it. Patient confirms she took the vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021. On Sunday, 10Jan2021, she started having a little bit of dizziness and feeling just not quite right. Sunday night, she went to bed and woke up at around 3:30 a.m. with severe chills and a fever. Her fever was a little over a 100. She states it took about 2 hours to get her chills under control. She took 2 Tylenol at that time. That day (11Jan2021) she ran fever off and on all day. The next day (12Jan2021), she seemed to be better. She had a low-grade fever, but she was better. She was just kind of tired from the day before. But then, that night, she ended up with the same thing again- she woke up at 4am with chills. Her fever had gone up 101.7, and she ended up taking 2 Tylenol and so forth. She got up that morning around 10 am, and was nauseated. She threw up that morning. She felt really bad. She was experiencing tiredness, muscle aches. (At this point it was about Tuesday (12 Jan) or Wednesday (13 Jan). There was one day during the day, she felt better, but a day went by and she ended up having the chills and fever again. Every time her fever kept going up. Her fever this particular night was 102 something. About Wednesday night, when she had the chills and fever, her fever went up to 103.8. That next morning, she called her doctor&#39;s office and tried to get an appointment. She could not get an appointment with the office. Her office ended up doing a televist and sending her a Prednisone pack to take for the reaction that it seemed she was having. She started the prednisone pack which seemed to take the fever down and the chills ended up stopping. Caller clarifies further she believes she has recovered from the fever and chills. The Prednisone pack seemed to kind of make those symptoms go away. However, she still felt really bad. This went on all weekend again. Tuesday of this week, (19Jan2021), she still felt really bad. She called her doctor again and her doctor wouldn&#39;t see her because of the symptoms she is having after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are the same symptoms of the actual COVID-19 virus. She clarifies further the adverse effects of the shot are also same ones as the COVID-19 virus. Her doctor suggested she either go to the Emergency Room or to an Urgent Care. Patient called the Urgent Care and they were able to do a COVID test on her to check and see if she did have COVID-19. She confirms this test was on Tuesday, 19Jan2021. The results came back negative. However, they did another swab test. The patient is unsure what the second swab test was for but was told it would be a couple days before they would have the results of this test. At this point, they put her on a Z-pak. Patient mentions she has heart problems. She has nitroglycerin for any problems that she has. She started having some heart pains when she was down to about 3 tablets of that Prednisone pack she was taking. When she took one of the Prednisone tablets, within 30 minutes of taking it, she started having chest pains. She clarifies it started in her throat and went down to her chest. She took 2 nitroglycerin&#39;s to get her feeling back to normal/better. Caller doesn&#39;t provide NDC, Lot number or expiration date for the Nitroglycerin she took when probed. Patient mentions her cheeks had been pink. She doesn&#39;t really know but she may have a little swelling in her face. She can&#39;t figure that out herself. She was experiencing dizziness and weakness. Today is the first day which is the 13th day after receiving the vaccine, she has felt like trying to get this stuff together and her thoughts together to try and figure out what is going on with her. She tried calling her primary doctor and this urgent care and she couldn&#39;t get anybody to see her. Patient got her Prednisone pack filled at (Pharmacy name), (Address details) The prescription was issued to her on Thursday, 14Jan2021, but she didn&#39;t start taking the pack until Saturday. On Saturday, that&#39;s when her fever had went up to 103 and she knew she needed to take the Prednisone pack. They are 4mg tablets and she started out taking 6 tablets the first day and then her dose decreased every day. NDC: 164793723369, Lot: 20K0041P, she believes the second digit is a zero and not a &#34;D&#34;, Expiry date: Aug2022. Z-pak: patient states she no longer has the box, therefore she is not sure of the dose and how it was prescribed. She makes the comment she believes the first day it was 2 tablets. NDC: Unknown, Lot: 7996030, Expiry: Feb2022. She clarifies she did not take Tylenol as stated earlier. She took Kirkland&#39;s brand, Acetaminophen. They are 500mg tablets. She provides the following product information: Lot: 2GE1779B. The last digit is either a &#34;B&#34; or an 8/, Expiry date: May2015; patient clarifies she knows they just bought this bottle, but she thinks her husband put his extra pills in the wrong bottle. No further details were provided or obtained in regard to this statement. The patient wants to find out about this and what is going on with her. To her understanding and her reading information, she is scheduled to take her next shot 27Jan2021. She is not supposed to take it then, correct? Investigations: patient confirms she had a COVID-19 test done (she is not sure what type of test- PCR, Antibody, etc), they swabbed her nose and the results came back negative. She had a second test done, where they swabbed her nose again, but she hasn&#39;t got the results back. She isn&#39;t sure what that test is for. Vaccination Facility Type was Hospital. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was no. Did any AE(s) require a visit to: Emergency Room was No, she is trying to keep herself out of the hospital. Physician Office? Her doctor would not see her but offered a virtual visit. She did go to the Urgent Care. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): Caller states she went to the foot doctor on 22Dec2021 (pending clarification). She was given injections in her feet because she has bone spurs and arthritis in her feet. Patient does not know exactly what kind of injection it was. She confirms she has no name, ndc, lot and expiry date for the injections she received. Patient asks the call handler, what should she have done on this? She was lost. She read the information that was provided to her and she doesn&#39;t feel there was sufficient information on what to do if you had a reaction. She guesses the best thing she can be told is to call #. She didn&#39;t know it was a # emergency. She didn&#39;t know what she was supposed to do. It was hard for her to get any information out of anybody as to what to do. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient presented on 1/24 with acute onset weakness and numbness of the left leg so a stroke alert was activated. NIHSS 3. Head Ct and CTA head/neck were unremarkable. Not a candidate for tPA given on Eliquis. Initial exam was notable for weakness and sensory loss in the left leg, but a sensory level was also found to the umbilicus raising concern for a myelitis. Of note, the patient also reported that certain red colored things she looked at appeared black. Labs unrevealing- CBC, CMP unremarkable. ESR, CRP normal. UA and UCx positive for E. Coli UTI, she was treated with ceftriaxone. MRIs were done of her brain, cervical and thoracic spine which were unrevealing. On 1/25, her exam worsened including worsening weakness in the left leg and new numbness and paresthesias in the right leg. Reflexes were preserved. MRI L spine was done which was unrevealing. Lumbar puncture was done which showed 2 nucleated cells and mildly elevated protein at 50, but was otherwise unrevealing. IgG Index normal. No oligoclonal bands. She developed mild hyperreflexia in the left leg and continued to have a sensory level, now at around T5-6. Repeat imaging of her cervical and thoracic spine were completed on 1/28 which showed a contrast enhancing hyperintensity at T5. The patient was diagnosed with myelitis and she was started on IV methylprednisolone x5 days and sent to rehab. Patient is now significantly improved though continues to report some numbness in the left leg.

                                                About 11 am I was masked in church and developed a tickle in my throat.  I cleared my throat to no relief.  I took 2 cough drops. About 11:30 I got a bottle of water.  No relief after drinking 8 ounces.  I left the service, went outside, removed my mask and was coughing forcibly for about 15 minutes or so.  Expectorated clear phlegm 6 - 8 times.  Gradually I settled to normal.  Just some residual soreness in throat.  This was an unusual occurrence for me.   I was covid positive in early Dec, but had a very mild case. Back in the 70&#39;s I would have reaction to allergy shots.  I waited in the office 15 minutes, but 45 minutes later when I arrived home I had huge hives and severe itching.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Feb2021 at 12:20 (at the age of 75-year-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination.  Medical history included reverse total shoulder replacement on 26Jan2021, cardiomyopathy from an unknown date, and type 2 diabetes mellitus from an unknown date.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received her shingles shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and flu shot (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN); both in Oct2020 for immunization and had no reactions.  On 05Feb2021 at 16:00, the patient experienced hives and itching. On 05Feb2020, the patient had blotches, blistering, swollen hands, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands. The clinical course was as follows: She had absolutely no problem at the time of the injection, no soreness with it she was fine and then she had welts starting with 2-3 then all over her body, that were itching terribly. They stared on the left wrist, both hands. The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL); but it did not help. The patient then went to the emergency room (ER). By the time she got to the ER, the hives moved up to her abdomen and she was covered in big blistery looking raisings and few small raises on her trunk and arms. The hives were concentrated from her fingers to her elbow, and then there were other blotches on her elbows to her fingers that were real concentrated. She stayed at the hospital for 3 hours, but she was not admitted. At the ER, she received pantoprazole (PROTONIX), diphenhydramine hydrochloride, hydroxyzine (ATARAX) and prednisone (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient also stated that her hands were so swollen after getting the dose of the vaccine that she couldn&#39;t get them closed and she had cracking creases with serous fluid coming out of both hands. The swelling went down a little bit the next day; but she still had the blotches. She said the itch was tolerated. However, the blistering started again. Her doctor put her on a sliding scale of prednisone and diphenhydramine at 25 mg every 6 hours. The clinical outcome of the swelling hands was recovering; while that of the blotches and blisters were not recovered. The clinical outcomes of the hives, itching, and cracked creases with serous fluid coming out of the hands were unknown. The patient assessed the events to be medically significant as she had never experienced anything like this.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal relationship, a possible contribution role of vaccination with BNT162B2 to the onset of the reported events cannot be excluded. The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 75-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL3248, NDC/UPC number and expiry date were unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 12Jan2021 at 10:00 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine facility type was reported as the &#34;doctor&#39;s office/urgent care.&#34; Relevant medical history included high blood pressure, but it was controlled blood pressure/hypertension; asthma, for which she was not taking medication at the time of the report, because it was under control; non allergic rhinitis; pre diabetes; and a little overweight. The patient further stated that she had just general medical history, which she had everything under control. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), atorvastatin (LIPITOR), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), and metformin. The patient previously took to iodine, doxycycline, erythromycin, and azithromycin, for which the patient had known allergies to all of it. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient had no COVID-19 prior vaccination. She was not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The patient stated that on 12Jan2021 at 10:30, she had adverse reactions to the Pfizer vaccine; she had severe allergic reaction within about 30 minutes and then they call the paramedic she ended up and they gave her a shot, which she did not know if it was prednisone. It was further reported that she took her inhaler too as they said she was wheezing, which she didn&#39;t really feel in her lungs. The patient just felt that what happen was she went to the car as they said to wait 15 minutes as written, and she always follow the rules and the whole thing they said, she waited 30 minutes, so she went down side of her car then she figured that she could just drive off drive home. So, she was in car sitting or waiting for the last 30 minutes and all of a sudden she felt right through her chest like through her right side kind of going into her left; it was weird like she could feel going into her body, then suddenly her heart start beating really fast, and then she pulled down the vizor and looked in the rearview mirror and her face was all red, so she go back to the site. That&#39;s how she transpired and then, that&#39;s how the reaction was. It was further reported that the patient waited 15 minutes in the office, then went to car to wait additional 15 minutes, and suddenly felt strange sensation in her chest and her heart started beating very rapidly. She pulled down the visor in car and saw her face growing red and swelling slightly and her breathing was becoming labored. She had read on side effects on information she was given on departure stating symptoms of an allergic reaction. She returned to the facility at which time she was treated. The adverse events (AE) resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient had no investigation assessment. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of all the events, which included that the patient was given a shot of 125 mg of methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL), but another report said they gave her prednisone so they were kind of conflicting in the report, but it was a shot, and also cetirizine (ZYRTEC) and famotidine (PEPCID), and her inhaler for wheezing. The patient recovered from all the events on an unspecified date.

A 75-years-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 11Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma initially diagnosed at 21 years old, ongoing arthritis diagnosed 10-15 years before but she thinks she had it since she was 35, multiple joint replacements, past pneumonia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received methotrexate 25mg a week orally for arthritis but she quit taking it about 3 months before in preparation of getting the vaccine.

An EKG performed on 15Feb2021 as pending results. The event of breathing problems was serious due to disability. The events mild fever, roof of mouth itching, muscle ache, joint ache, rapid heart rate up to 130 and itchy skin were medically significant. The patient reported that initially, the roof of her mouth started itching. It literally happened as soon as she had the vaccine. She took a Benadryl. She didn&#39;t have a skin irruption, but did have itchy skin. The next day, she had a low grade fever. She had muscle and joint aches. She had no rash, but a little nausea. She had breathing problems. She had asthma issues and wheezing after the vaccine. That is how she described her breathing issues. She had a rapid heart rate. It went up to 130. It could of been because of fever, her breathing, or pain. There was a period of days then it resolved. On 15Feb2021, she feels almost human. She had routine arthritis lab drawn on 15Feb2021. They showed a CRP level of 11.5 which shows inflammation. She normally was below 0.29 which was within normal limits. That was an extreme difference. That was a lot of inflammation. The patient had to get her nebulizer out to breathe. She has taken Tylenol a couple of times. Her lab work was essentially normal. The CBC and chemical panel was okay. The patient thoughts the fever was important because she has been immunocompromised for years by Methotrexate. She has had pneumonia before with no fevers. Her eyes were also really sore. They bothered her. She already had to use eye drops. That was 11Feb2021 it was gone on 15Feb2021 but it kind of lasted a few days. Her muscles were better, but her joints still hurt some. But her joints always hurt some. She has had multiple joint replacements. The muscles in her legs were severe Friday and Saturday. Her muscles aren&#39;t hurting now, but her joints were but that was kind of normal. Her peak flow was way down on 14Feb2021. It was at 250. She did finally get it up to 350 by using her nebulizer. Her best effort normally is 450. Her peak flow was down quite a bit. She has been having breathing changes for a year. They were not sure what it was about. It could be an acute episode of something. On unknown date (next morning as reported), her pulse was 90-100. Now her heart rate was only elevated with activity. Her heart rate was down in the 70s, but when moving it was in the low 100s. With activity it was still up. It was hanging out in the 70s except exercising. She considers walking across the room exercising.  All her other labs were in within normal limits. The patient wanted to know if the inflammatory response was secondary to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of serious events cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.
