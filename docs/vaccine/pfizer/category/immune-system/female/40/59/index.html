I also had some numbness on the top of my thigh.  I sat for monitoring for a couple hours and was sent home.  The tingling moved to the back of my head for a little while last night and seemed to had resolved before I went to bed around 10p. The tingling seems very minimal this morning...on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the most noticeable, yesterday was a 10. Today seems to be a 1 or 2. Only noticeable if I am sitting still and be more along my ear and not my head or shoulder. There is still the weird feeling (similar to numbness) in my face and my thigh. My face is getting better.

I pulled over and called my husband. I could breathe fine, but the sensation of swelling in my throat was frightening and I felt like I couldnt swallow my saliva. I also had the feeling like I might faint (hot and flushed). This all passed pretty quickly (5 minutes), and I took a benadryl when I got home and rested.

                                                Angioedema; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Other Health Professional (patient). A 40-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1284, intramuscular in the right arm (also reported as right shoulder), first dose on 22Dec2020 00:30 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s relevant medical history included severe reaction to some animal dander and pollen, severe reactions to poison oak, possible drug induced reactions (unspecified) post C-section, mild rash with influenza vaccine this year (2020) (with no other hx of adverse reaction to a vaccine); had allergies to pollen, mold, some animals. The patient previously took influenza vaccine (split virion, inactivated) and experienced rash. The patient had no covid prior vaccination nor was she tested post vaccination. Adverse event reported was angioedema on 24Dec2020 with outcome of recovering. Systems started appearing on 23Dec2020 evening with slight rash and fluid collection under right eye. Developed more rash on 24Dec2020. In the evening to early morning of 25Dec2020, symptoms worsened significantly. Rapid swelling to face occurred. Swelling was concentrated around eyes and cheeks the most. Both right and left side of the face and neck were affected. However, the right side face had a more pronounced reaction. MD ordered oral prednisone and Benadryl as treatment plan. Also, ordered episode-pen for a worst case scenario. Symptoms have been improving under treatment but still persist some. The events were reported as non-serious. The adverse event start date was 24Dec2020 (as reported). The event resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a reasonable possibility that the event angioedema was related to BNT162b2 based on known drug safety profile and temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

It was painful and partially mobile.  No other symptoms other than those of headache a few days prior mentioned below. I went to urgent care on 12/29 where CXR and soft tissue ultrasound were ordered. CXR normal. US 12/30 showed cluster of lymph nodes in that area.   Lump appears to be smaller this week and not painful.   Also, I developed a severe migraine on 12/26 (5d post vaccine). So severe that it was debilitating which is unusual for me. It lasted approximately 36 hours.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0930 am 1/6, about 6 hours later I started feeling extreme fatigue and a slight sore throat. I left work early at that time. When I got home I couldn&#39;t stay awake and fell asleep around 6pm. Then starting having GI distress cramping, pain and diarrhea around 9pm-11pm. At 2 am I woke up with chills and fever, I took a Tylenol around 3-4 m and then broke out if huge sweat, then finally fell asleep. 1/7/21 I mostly have soreness, headache and fatigue now.

I thought it was just a normal vaccine reaction because I have had those in the past.  It seemed to get a little smaller and less red/warm in the next few days but then started to get more red and swollen in the past 24-48 hours. It has been a week since the vaccine. It is itching some now for the past 2 days as well.

                                                On Monday January 4th I received my Covid-19 vaccine at work, at 410pm. That evening went uneventful. The following day, Tuesday January 5th I woke up with a sore right arm and a slight headache. The headache increased in intensity throughout the day, developing also body aches and a fever of 100.4. The symptoms seemed to improve slightly after taking Tylenol.  The next day, Wednesday January 6th I felt much better, the body aches were almost gone, I had no fever and no headache. When I got home from work I noticed hives all over my arms, anterior and posterior neck - going into the hairline, face, especially around my mouth, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back. The affected areas were itchy and I also felt a slight burning/stinging sensation on my neck. Even though I did not notice any hives on my legs, my right ankle was itchy, as well. I took Claritin 10 mg and I did not notice much difference. When I woke up today, Wednesday January 7th the hives were still present on my arms, chest, abdomen and back and they looked like dissipating.  It is currently 6:12 pm on January 7th and my hives are almost gone

                                                Received vaccine at 1730, then just before midnight my heart began to pound hard and very fast, and it made me feel short of breath or as though I had to cough. After about a minute I thought it might be SVT so I did a valsalva maneuver and it stopped.  I was resting in bed, no alcohol or caffeine, and this has never happened to me before. Since then, I have felt at least one heart palpitation per day, sometimes many more. The last few days I have felt extremely fatigued and have had an odd sensation in my chest. On 1/7 I developed a dry cough, and was swabbed for Covid because I felt so bad. It was negative. This made me wonder if the odd sensation in my chest was related to my heart and not my lungs. I am due for my second vaccine today, and am unsure if I should get it.

Approximately 6 hours after getting the shot I started feeling tired and a couple hours after that I felt crummy and the chills started.  Mine weren&#39;t nearly as bad as some others have experienced.  I didn&#39;t sleep well that night and woke up with a mild headache and body aches.  Approximately 10AM on Thursday I noticed I had swelling in my upper lip and later my jawline with slight numbness.  My eyes started feeling puffy that evening, approximately 6:30pm, and the symptoms began to improve after taking a Benadryl around 7:15pm.  The swelling and numbness didn&#39;t seem to move down towards my throat nor did I experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing.  I sl

I am under the assumption this is likely a swollen lymph node post second vaccination. I have taken ibuprofen in attempt to help with pain and inflammation but does not seem to be helping much at this time. I anticipate this will improve over time.

She has had the expected fatigue, muscle aches, headache, chills.   however, she had also developed significant swelling in her left armpit and the swelling has spread into her left chest wall and down into her left ribs. It has also become painful. It?s very painful to lower her arm against her body, to raise her arm above her shoulder, to lift anything, even a bottle of water. It?s also painful to take a deep breathe right in the area on the left chest where the swelling is and into her ribs under her armpit. The area doesn?t seem to be significant red or warm. It is very tender to touch and the swollen area is firm.  It has not responded to ice or NSAIDS. Her shoulder and arm do not seem to have any swelling.&#34;

                                                Prior to 1st Covid vaccination the patient reported a history of mast cell syndrome resulting in numerous anaphylactic events.  The patient had been consulted by her immunologist to proceed with vaccination and due to her history she was observed for a period of 30 minutes.  Upon returning for her 2nd vaccination she reported that she experienced some skin manifestations (hives) but no anaphylactic reaction resulting in difficulty breathing.  She stated that she had discussed this again with her immunologist and she wished to proceed with the 2nd dose and she was prepared to receive EpiPen if necessary if reaction develops.  Within 10 minutes of the vaccination she felt flushing sensation and then itching all over and her &#34;throat closing up&#34;.  She was quickly administered 0.3 mg IM epinephrine and IM diphenyhydramine with some improvement in her symptoms.  While being transported to the ED an additional 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine was administered.  The emergency department also administered the following treatments: famotidine 40 IV x 1 dose, methylprednisolone 125 mg IV x 1 dose, racepinephrine nebulized x 1 dose.  The patient was ultimately discharged approximately 2 hours later with return to her baseline condition.

                                                ?Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA. My Left Leg (entire leg) was swollen &amp; Numb) I received my vaccine and when I arrived home about 1pm that day My leg felt odd.  when walking, standing I felt an odd sensation in my left foot/lower calf area.  I had body aches mild which progressed at night especially pain running down my left side of my body.   The next morning I put on my clothes for work and my body still mild aches but the pant leg was tight especially around the calf.  My My left foot was swollen as well as my shoe fit tighter.  I also had a numbing sensation through the leg.  I had an ache behind the calf and the heel of my foot as well as the left foot of my left foot.  The swelling remained and I worried I might have a DVT.  I called my primary care DR office and they said I should go to the ER.  I called employee health at my job and they told me go to the ER.  So on 12/29/2020 I went to the ER.  The providers there also thought I had a DVT especially after examining my leg and recognizing the significant swelling.  My US venous doppler showed negative for DVT however a significantly enlarged lymph node.  As of today the swelling is much improved however still slight.  The sensation in my left foot is still not the same as before.  I have a numbness and tingling sensation that runs from my Left lateral calf down to the sole of my foot.

                                                I received my shot at 12:15 at around 12:30 I started feeling more aware of my throat. My swallowing felt slightly off however, I was not aspirated secretions. My throat felt slightly thick and I had the sensation of wanting to clear my throat. I took a deep breath and I could breath.  It started to feel like my throat was getting sore or irritated. I felt slightly warmer. I decided to wait the full 30 minutes. When I went to stand had a moment of dizziness that passed but then I felt lightheadedness for about 2 hours after the injection. My ear felt like it was warm and there was slight pressure there. My throat continued to feel irritated and still feels lightly irritated after 4 days.  After about 3 hours it felt like something lifted and I felt better. That night I was really fatigued and tired. Maybe slightly cold. The next day felt fine except for the throat irritation that still persists today.  The side where I received the injection my arm, shoulder, and chest area felt affected for two days after receiving injection.

Around 8:57, I had a metallic taste in my mouth and the left side of my tongue went numb.  A little later the left side of my face felt weird and the inside of my ear felt numb. It wasn&#39;t tingling, but it felt like I had a Novacaine shot (like when you get a filling at the dentist).   My neck got stiff and I was really tired.  The symptoms lasted about 4 hours.    When I woke up this morning the left side of my face and jaw still do not feel 100%.  My left eye is watery.  I&#39;m very tired.

She had taken a dose  of Benadryl, 50 mg p.o. prior to coming  to the clinic,  due to her prior history of allergies. Her blood pressure was checked in left arm, 134/94. She denied chest pain, SOB or feeling of swelling in tongue or face. After the tingling sensation, she began to experience pruritus of her arms, back and scalp. Visual inspection revealed no visible rash or hives. When she began rubbing on her left arm to relieve the itchy sensation, the area of rubbing became erythematous. She was observed for 45 minutes after the injection. Symptoms did not progress and she was discharged from the clinic. Phone follow-up 24 hours later: pruritus has resolved. She took 2 more doses of Benadryl 50 mg p.o. yesterday, at 2 p.m. and 11 p.m. Only symptom reported today is sleepiness.

                                                Guillain Barre Syndrome; the patient&#39;s tongue started to go numb; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: Unspecified adverse event. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 18Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from contactable consumers, sibling of the patient and his wife. A 40-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There was no medical history, Family Medical History Relevant to adverse events or concomitant medications. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks and no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The sibling of the patient reported the patient had an adverse event after the vaccine that he later described as Guillain Barre. The patient was hospitalized after receiving the COVID vaccine on 08Jan2021. She was admitted to the hospital, the consumer (the sibling&#39;s wife) thought, on either 14-15Jan2021. She was not sure of the admitting diagnosis but patient was being treated for Guillain Barre Syndrome. Patient has had a spinal tap on an unspecified date, no results were known. The patient was very healthy, in general the consumer knew she had no typical comorbidities. The reason it was thought to be related was she was perfectly healthy prior and right after she got the vaccine, the patient&#39;s tongue started to go numb, that day or the day after (in Jan2021). The events required a visit to Emergency Room, but not to Physician Office. Weight was unknown but the patient was very fit, and BMI (Body mass index) had to be in the normal range. The outcome of the events was unknown.

I took her blood pressure, it was 158/83, Pulse 92, Respirations 20, not shortness of breath or respiratory difficulty noted. She laid down and continued to feel the same way after 2 hours post vaccination. Her husband picked her up and she went home to rest for the day. She was given instructions on when to seek medical attention and to call me later today to let me know how she is feeling.

                                                Hives, sneezing, anaphylaxis, wheezing, itchy throat, stuffy, started in evening, hives first then itchy throat, probably about an hour, as that got worse throat started swelling. Took 50mg prednisone 2 benadryl and albuterol inhaler.  Breathing got better and hives went away but still had swollen throat and took pepcid. Headache afterwards but that&#39;s typical of an allergic reaction.  I can&#39;t be sure it was from the vaccine or not but nothing I did yesterday would normally trigger that reaction

Moderate/Severe Fatigue set in around 3-6pm. Needed to nap from 4-5pm (extremely unsusual). Felt fine the next day. Moderate congestion in ears starting around the same time (6 hours after) and is persisting 30 hrs later. Feel like my ears will not pop and trying to yawn a lot. Also felt pretty bad sinus congestion starting at 7pm 12/21 (10 hrs after vaccine). Could not breathe through nostrils. Treated with sinus rinse and sudafed.

I dosed Benadrly and used hydrocortisone cream to the area.  Throughout the night, the rash appeared on both thighs, knees, back of the arms and along the back of the lower legs.  Again raised pruritic wheals.  It would improve with anti-histamine use.   this continued until 12/29/2020.  No persistent symptoms.  There are no other changes in medicine, OTC medication use, no changes in foods/soaps etc.

See in urgent care at work, EKG showed ectopy. She was sent to the nearby emergency room, where she was monitored and given iv fluids, oxygen and tylenol. She is feeling better today one day later, and will have follow-up with cardiology. Vaccine administration may have set off underlying predisposition for PVC&#39;s, ectopy. Was aware of PVC&#39;s previously but well-controlled on diltiazem. Has now been switched to metoprolol.

My left upper thigh had a burning feeling around the outer part and in the goin on that thigh a painful lymph node. That afternoon I had a burning sensation on my left butt cheek. When I looked I noticed a very small rash with blisters. I waited through the weekend because I knew the OBGYN was not open. I called first thing Monday morning and made an appointment as soon as they could see me which was the next day  (1/5/2021)at 3:30pm. The doctor took samples and sent them to the lab for testing. The test was positive for shingles. I am now taking valtrex for shingles.

Since the injection I had been getting headaches almost daily, mostly on my right side of my head.  On Dec. 5, 2021 I noticed I was getting a sore eyebrow.  Later that evening ok noticed swollen lymph nodes throughout my scalp, face, ear, jaw, neck and chest.  My eyebrow also started to swell and was slightly pink.  When the swelling was worse the next day - I went to urgent care and saw A doctor that diagnosed me with facial cellulitis.  After a couple days my eye was not getting any better and started to itch severely.  Called to urgent care over the weekend and takes to one of the providers who said to use cold compresses and elevate my head as much as I could.  On Dec. 11, 2021 I called back to the provider I had seen on Dec. 6 - he told me he believed I had developed shingles and to go to the eye doctor that day.  I saw a doctor on Dec. 11 &amp; was diagnosed with shingles.  They started me on antivirals along with the antibiotics they had prescribed on Dec. 6.

I went over to find the employee sitting in the person&#39;s office in a chair. She was able to tell me she received her first COVID vaccine approx 30 mins ago. She stated she stayed there for the 15 mins after the vaccine with no reaction. She is now having ringing in her ears, feeling lightheaded, hot, nauseaus, and &#34;I feel like I am in a cloud.&#34; She denies allergies or past hx of vaccine reactions. Denies hx of anaphylaxis. She denied any sob or chest pain. Employee was holding her head. She stated she had only had some coffee and juice today and was feeling hot. BP was taken and was 112/90 and she is not tachy and no resp distress observed. Patient was able to speak to me in full complete sentences initially. Another person came over and the employee was asked if she could stand and walk. Employee stated she felt she could stand and walk and when she did this she had to hold onto something to avoid falling and she was sat back down. Emergency services was called and employees speech was slow and almost slurred at times. Emergency services arrived and transported employee.

A 41-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number EJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 18Dec2020 10:00 AM (at the age of 41-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included that the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to the vaccination. The patient did not have any allergies to medications, food, or other products. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other medication in the two weeks prior to the vaccination. On 19Dec2020 14:00 PM, the patient experienced a swollen lymph node approximately the size of a baseball that developed under her left armpit. It took about 5 days to completely resolve. The patient did not receive any treatment for the event. The patient had not tested for COVID-19 post vaccination. The outcome of the event, swollen lymph node, was recovered, in Dec2020.

When asked if she ever takes BENADRYL for her previous medication reactions Pt states &#34;yes&#34;.  I asked her if she has someone who can drive her home and she made arrangements for her co-worker to take her. Gave Pt BENADRYL 25 mg po one for potential reaction symptoms at 15:05. Moved Pt to a quieter place to monitor and observe. Gave her a warm blanket and some juice. Vitals at 15:18:  BP= 116/68, HR=80 Resp rate 16-18.

                                                About 10 minutes after getting my vaccine I noticed the roof of my mouth itching as well as my tongue and back of my throat.  I waited to see if it would go away and then a couple minutes later noticed my lips started itching and swelling and from there it just got worse.  I told the nurse practitioner that I think I was having a reaction, she had me take a seat told her my entire mouth throat &amp; lips felt swollen and itching and she looked and said it was full blown anaphylaxis reaction.  Administered EpiPen, benadryl and called ambulance where they took me to medial emergency department.

When driving  home from work, she instantly felt really hot and had a lot of flushing that felt like a hot flash. Hot all over. Had to pull over and take off layers of clothes. Sat with the air on in the car. Burning sensation when she got home felt like brillo pad  was used on face. Burning sensation on cheek all the way down to chin. Face was really on fire. Today, the burning sensation have gotten better, but her cheeks still have prickly, tight sensation. Headache at 8pm yesterday when she was trying to go to bed at the back of the head. Felt like a lot of pressure.

Although we knew I?d have side effects that would out weigh me getting the virus, we didn?t think ahead of that. My adverse event is that I ended up with a hernia in my lower left stomach.  I have a bulge and some pain. My surgeon will be able to fix it after 3 months post-op.

                                                I started itching while being monitored post vaccine administration within the 5 minutes of the vaccine being administered. The itching was everywhere including my tongue and throat, since this is my workplace and I was working I had to go home and was given Benadryl to take upon arrival, the Benadryl did not help so I did a virtual visit with a physician who recommended that I increase the dose of benadryl at the same time I called my PCP to inform them of the issue they ordered, Atarax 25 mg every 6 hours plus taking an over the counter antihistamine.

                                                I received my second dose of Pfizer&#39;s Covid vaccine on 1/9/21.  The person who gave the vaccine administered it SQ, not IM.  I did develop a cellulitis like reaction to the area.  The redness began almost immediately following the vaccine, however, the following 2 days the area grew larger and hot to touch.  The area currently is red and itchy, however, swelling and warmth is gone.  My concern is the efficacy of the vaccine since it was not given IM.

                                                Within 25 minutes of receiving the vaccine, my left arm became very heavy and there was a tingling/neuro sensation in left wrist/hand. A pressure began in the  anterior of my throat which increased gradually. I sought treatment in our Urgent Care just after noon that same day. The Provider monitored my vitals which were good and administered liquid Pepcid. Said Provider chose not to give Benadryl as I had taken Zyrec that morning for my allergies. I was discharged from the Urgent Care and went back to work at 1245. At 1730 hours, I had a slight headache above my right eye and extreme right-sided jaw pain with tooth sensitivity. These lasted for only 10 minutes. At 1830, the anterior and bilateral portions of my throat began to feel &#34;prickly&#34; and I developed a wheeze. I used an albuterol inhaler to relieve the wheeze successfully. At this time I also developed an itchiness throughout my whole body, worse on left side than right side. I took 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. At 0300, I took another dose of 100mg of Benadryl with no relief. I also took an itch pill/antihistamine of my husband&#39;s which provided no relief. At 0800, I took 20 mg of Zyrtec. At 1030, I took 100mg of Benadryl. I continued to use Benadryl throughout the day, every 4-5 hours.  At 1800, I had a fullness in my throat, a tightness in my chest and my left shoulder blade felt almost numb.  I also had a hoarse voice which passed by the next morning. The chest tightness was intermittent over the next day or two.  On Friday, the itchiness had improved some but was still prominent. I continued to use Zyrtec and Benadryl throughout the day. My Primary Doctor called in Prednisone if needed. By Saturday morning, I felt MUCH better. Today is Sunday and I am no longer itching and I feel so much better today.

                                                I began feeling a sore, scratchy throat, a headache and localized redness and swelling at the injection site about 6 hours after receiving my vaccine. The next morning, about 18 hours after receiving the vaccine the injection site redness had extended to about 2&#34; and had become painful. At about 22 hours after injection I began having a significant headache, chills, elevated temperature of 100 degrees, body aches, exhaustion  and overall unwell feeling. This feeling persisted through the remainder of the day. By  46 hours post vaccination the redness and swelling had grown to about 3&#34; and now had a strong red center, was hot and hard to the touch.  I was still having chills, temperature stayed around 99 degrees, still felt tired and had headache.  At about 66 hours post injection I have sinus congestion and the swelling and redness at the injection site is about 3 1/2&#34;  and swelling without redness now  extends about 2&#34; past the redness down my arm.

Following this immunization, she appropriately stayed in the waiting area for the 30 minutes. She then got in car and 15 minutes after, she noticed that her tongue was feeling full/swollen and that was experiencing neck swelling. These symptoms persisted and resembled a prior allergic response to Tetracycline and Aleve. Wheezing and breathing difficulty ensued and EMS was activated.   On arrival to the emergency department she was found to have wheezing with stridor.  A dose of epinephrine was administered and she was monitored in the emergency department with an initial improvement in symptoms. Approximately one hour and 30 minutes after initial epinephrine administration patient reported that she was having continued difficulty swallowing and she was starting to feel a little worse.  At this point a second dose of IM epinephrine was administered.    The patient was subsequently  admitted to inpatient medicine team for further monitoring.

                                                About 45 minutes to an hour after the administration of the vaccine m, my cheeks became red, hot, and swollen. There were also hives. I took Benadryl which stopped the spreading but it did not go away. I had shortness of breath, and by about 6:00 it was hard to breath when lying down. I did an albuterol treatment with my nebulizer. It helped but it took much longer than usual. There were was about 30 minutes that I found my epipen and was going to the ED if it got worse.  My breathing improved. The red changed to pink but was still swollen and tight 7 hours later. The second one of Benadryl helped get rid of most of the pinkness. When I woke up this morning, I had a little bit of a wheezy cough that I didn?t have yesterday.  My daily Zyrtec and singular helped that a little. I have new hives along my jawline this morning that are very minor but they do itch. The redness and swelling was similar to reactions I?ve gotten when I drink a beer or have eaten soft shell crab, but typically Benadryl will clear that up and it doesn?t linger for so long.  This was more aggressive. My side effects at this point are minor, but I have a call in to my allergist to see if I should be doing anything different and questions about the second dose.

Chills within an hour, accompanied by sweating.  Continued to work through it because otherwise felt okay. Dizziness subsided shortly after additional antihistamine and Pepcid. Approximatley around 7 pm my face start burning and itching, I had a diffuse red rash all over my face and my torso. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and rash resolved. It was not hives, almost appeared as flushing, Over the weekend I had fevers, chills but nothing that prevented me from my daily life.  I however, have felt since my 2nd vaccine throat irritation, and itching, sweating. I am just continue my Zyrtec and regimen I took several years ago when I had this type of immune response. I didn&#39;t bother with MD, I left a message with nurse.

Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 41-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing artificial menopause (Surgical menopause, since she was 36). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After the first vaccine, caller started to have hot flashes again, and after the second vaccine they became unbearable. She had a reaction to the vaccine. She had a hormone reaction to it. The caller did research herself to look up hormonal things about the Pfizer vaccine, but she could not find anything. The only information she found was on pregnancy and breast feeding, and low estrogen with COVID. They had significantly subsided over the last year and half to two years. After the first vaccine, she started getting them a little. Then, after second vaccine her hot flashes started being unbearable. She was unsure if it had to do with the vaccine, but she felt like it did. She spoke with nurses she works with. They too had hormonal issues after the vaccine. One had difficulty getting her period for 9 months to a year, but then got their period. She talked to people in menopause who have not had their period for a year, and had one after the vaccine. She talked to women with PCOS that had difficulty getting their period, but got their period after the vaccine. She also talked to women who had normal menopause, that hadn&#39;t had their period in a long time get a period. She said this was all generalized information. She doesn&#39;t have the specifics for the people that reported it. There was something hormonal going on. It was literally driving her nuts. Her first vaccine she got on the 29Dec2020, Lot number: EJ1686. Her second vaccine she got on 19Jan2021, lot number: EL9261. This all started a week after the first shot, and got worse after the second. She felt like this was medically significant. There was a fine line between medical issues and mental health, and she felt like this was affecting her mental health. Outcome of events was not recovered.   Reaction assessed: after the first vaccine, caller started to have hot flashes again, and after the second vaccine they became unbearable.

                                                Anaphylactic shock? Shortly after receiving the vaccine my arm was sore and I had a severe headache. Approximately 24-48 hours after I received the vaccine I started developing a red, hot, itchy raised rash on my ears and buttocks which became more prevalent and peaked around 80-90 hours later. Approximately 82 hours after I received the vaccine, I began to feeI nauseous, dizzy, and fatigued so I stood up to get ready for bed early. While brushing my teeth, I went pale white and felt like I was going to vomit. I put the toothbrush down and got on floor. My pulse felt like it had stopped. I tried to check my pulse and I could only detect one beat every other second. I called for my spouse and by the time he got to bathroom I was passed out. I came back to after about 30 seconds and was convulsing from chills. He put a blanket on me and grabbed my Apple Watch to try to get my pulse which read in the 50s (so I assume it was much lower when I passed out). My hands and feet were tingly and I stayed on the floor until my pulse got back up. I then had diarrhea. At this point in time the rash was most prevalent and was present mostly on my buttocks but also on my ears, scalp, pointer finger on right hand, thighs, and hips. I went to doctor the following morning an my vitals, blood sugar, EKG, urine screen were stable and indicated no issues. 106 hours later I still have the rash on all areas mentioned and am dizzy, nauseous, and fatigued.

On January 26 she noted edema of her eyes and lips associated with facial redness and itching that she treated with Benadryl intermittently for the past 2.5 weeks.  She was seen in follow-up by her dermatologist who suspected an inflammatory reaction and prescribed anti-itch facial cream.  She was also seen by her primary care who suspected angioedema and prescribed her an EpiPen which she has not needed to use.   Pfizer shot #2: 2nd shot delayed due to snow. Above sx resolved before shot #2. She had her 2nd COVID injection February 20 at 3:50 p.m. About 1.5-2 hours later she noted onset of itching to her eyes and nipples along with itching of the skin in the locations of her usual eczema.  She noted that her lips and eyes were a little puffy but less severe swelling to the eyes and lips than the 1st injection.  She took 2 Benadryl shortly after onset of these symptoms.  This seemed to lessen symptoms about 50%. Later she noticed that her voice sounded raspy and hoarse and she had a sensation of swelling to her tongue and throat but she was able to swallow.  Her throat felt scratchy.  She denies having lightheadedness, urticaria or GI symptoms. She went to the ED and was treated with benadryl, solumedrol and pepcid, monitored for a few hours and then discharged on 60 mg prednisone X 3 days and advised to continue benadryl 50 mg Q6h. She takes zyrtec 10 mg BID for seasonal/perennial allergies.   Allergy history: She has a history of both idiopathic urticaria in early childhood and idiopathic angioedema in her early 20&#39;s. States she had extensive testing but the cause was never exposed. Took high dose prednisone for 4-5 months, angioedema resolved spontaneously and then flared again a few months later. Finally resolved with n additional 3 months of prednisone. She has both seasonal (feb-may) and perennial allergies to cat and dust, asthma and allergy to ampicillin--rash in childhood, and humira--fevers.

                                                About 5 minutes after the shot, I started to feel a tightness in my throat.  It lasted a couple of minutes and then passed. Then about 45 minutes after I started to feel a heaviness/ache in my upper chest. This feeling continued for days. Around day four I began to have a feeling of great pressure in my throat, particularly when swallowing. I noticed that my heartrate was elevated, but that might have been because the feeling was very stressful.  The feeling would increase when I turned my head to the side or put my chin down.This feeling persisted for 3 days. After three days the feeling changed slightly and started feeling more like the sensation one gets when you have food stuck in your throat. As I type this, it is 8 days after the vaccine and I still feel this sensation in my throat.

A 42-years-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EK5730, expiration date not reported), intramuscular on the right arm on 31Dec2020 at 10:15 AM, at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included asthma, allergy, hypothyroidism, and some fish allergy. There were no concomitant medications (no other vaccine in four weeks and no other medications in two weeks). Patient previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergy. The patient is not pregnant. On 31Dec2020, after ten-15 minutes (10:30 AM) of receiving the vaccine, she was light headed and dizzy with some nausea. Monitored in the emergency room (ER) with high BP 140&#39;s and heart rate (HR) 110s to 120s. After an hour of saline bolus, she was better but she got nasal congestion and swelling of the face with sore throat. On 01Jan2021, after 24 hours, she got some soreness at the injection site with generalized body aches. Also she got some shortness of breath which lead to her asthma attack and difficulty sleeping. On 02Jan2021, after 48hours, she was feeling still light headed with some sore throat, chills, body aches and severe headache which lead her to go to the ER and got herself tested for flu, covid and strep, which came back all negative but her signs and symptoms (s/sx )still after discharge was getting worst especially the headache and generalized body aches. As well as congestion and sore throat. The patient had given &#34;Ivf&#34; for the events. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior to vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I started sweating and my skin was turning red. I notified staff and they kept me an additional 30 minutes. I started getting hives and my body felt hot. The fire fighters asked the nursing staff for Benadryl they advised they did not carry it and could not give it to me. I carry Benadryl in my work bag due to my list of allergies. Fire assisting at location advised me to take Benadryl. I notified my employer because Benadryl makes me sleepy. They sent me home and I continued Benadryl and missed work for three days.

                                                About 48 hours after vaccination, I developed tender and swollen lymphadenopathy from my axilla down the bottom of my arm to my elbow on my right side. This is the same side the injection was given. The injection site is no longer tender to touch but it is difficult to raise my arm and hold it straight due to discomfort. My arm is visibly swollen compared to my left arm. I can feel shotty lymph nodes down my arm.

I slept most of the day on Sunday after getting the shot the day before. I never checked my temperature to tell if I had a fever.  The night sweats continued into sunday night.   I took 600mg of advil for the body aches and went to bed.  When I woke up around 1:00 in the afternoon the body aches were gone and haven&#39;t returned.   Sunday night I was sweating most of the night and felt over heated until around 11:00 Monday morning.  I am always cold, I am the type who wears sweaters in the house all year long.  For me to be that hot in the house is very unusual.

Remained in the observation room symptom-free for additional 30 minutes.   At home, symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness returned and worsened.  Throat felt tight, able to move air, however had trouble swallowing.  Voice was raspy and increased coughing.  From past experience with allergy shots, this was my cue to use epi pen.  Within 5 minutes after using epi pen, all symptoms were resolved.

Could not do normal daily things without feeling wiped out . 3 Advil did nothing- sat 1/9.  Next day felt better.- sun 1/10.  That evening low grade fever 99.6 and achy again., mostly eyes and head.  Went to bed.  Monday okay. But noticed right armpit a pit puffy.- same side as injection.  Tuesday 1/12 woke up at 6:00am and had dull joint/bone pain bilaterally.  Ranging from neck ache, to sternum/upper back, shoulders, triceps.  Injection site still sore- slightly red off to the side.  Did some stretches in bed and eventually got up.  I am very in tune with my body- something is off.  I never wake up feeling ?bad?.  Fit, healthy and active normally.  Almost like a bad nights sleep with a poor mattress but only affected my upper body.  Took two Advil and hot shower- feel better but can tell something doesn?t feel right.

                                                While patient was receiving her second dose of the Pfizer brand Covid-19 vaccination (at 14:50), she mentioned to me that she had a sustained local reaction to her first dose.  Her arm had a hard, red, hot spot for approximately a week.  At this time I told her we would like her to stay under observation for 30  Min instead of the normal 15 min. At approximately 25 min post vaccination, the pt reported the following: &#34;arm felt heavy, both arms did, but more so the affected arm, instant headache, sore neck, vision went fuzzy, breathing wasn&#39;t difficult but felt labored, throat felt like it was closing/congested, rash on the inside of the affected arm&#34;.    Pt stated that her heart felt like it was &#34;pounding&#34;.    VS:  162/96, 99% RA, HR in the 70&#39;s.    Patient was administered 50ml IM diphenhydramine and monitored for 90 minutes in the clinic area.  Dr. was consulted and also spoke with the pt, advising her to continue with OTC diphenhydramine once at home.     The symptoms resolved after approximately 40 minutes.  By 17:00 the patient was deemed stable to go home with the instructions to go immediately to ED should any further Sx present.  It was verified that she did not live alone and would have someone with her that could assist.    Pt was subsequently followed up with a phone call on the next day by RN who relayed that she was very tired, but no other complications.

A 42-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) first dose on 23Dec2020 h 09:00 intramuscularly in left deltoid (left arm) lot number: EK5730 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Concomitant medications were not provided. Patient stated that she has had double mastectomy, and missing a lot of lymph nodes, states she got the first dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine on 23Dec2020, states it made her left subclavian lymph nodes swollen and hard. States that when she gets the flu vaccine at her hospital every year, she gets swollen lymph nodes ever since she had a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. She originally was wondering if she could get the vaccine in another large muscle group. States she even went as far as to cross reference flu shot ingredients with the Pfizer Covid ingredients to see if something in the vaccines were causing the swollen lymph nodes but was unable to come to any conclusion, the only think in common is the Sodium Chloride and she does not feel like that would cause any issue. States the swollen lymph nodes occurred after the Sanofi brand flu vaccine (no other information known or provided). Patient is on day 15 post vaccination and they are still swollen and hard, she is wondering if there is any data on how long this side effect can last. She made an appointment with her oncologist, she knows that the swollen lymph had the first dose, lymph nodes are still swollen and hard, knows it can cause swollen lymph nodes but wants to know what is the typically length of the event. Patient also experienced other side effects, on 30Dec2020 (last week), she developed vertigo that lasted through the weekend intermittently, states she at first thought she was having a stroke. States it seems to have subsided as of 05Jan2021 (yesterday). Patient also reported she had an itchy rash twice as part of her side effects reported from the COVID 19 vaccine. She noticed an itchy rash and it went away but she is unsure exactly the day or time. Stated she definitely remembered the rash on 28Dec2020 as she took pictures. It was gone in about three hours on the same day. She did not treat the rash because it was gone and not itching. The rash came and went and had not come back. It was mostly on the bends of the arms, bilateral arms. Patient reported developing swollen, tender, and hard lymph nodes under the Left subclavian area the day after the injection, on 24Dec2020. They were not as tender at the time of the report but were continuing and this was 15 days from her vaccination.

Took 50mg of Benadryl PO and went to the ED, about a 15 minute car ride. Had tingling and numbness of the tongue and back of throat by arrival but still able to breath with focus. Exertion of just walking into the ED greatly increased the SOB. Was triaged, Benadryl starting to help, was able to speak a little better, 3-4 words without too much SOB caused. Was walked to a room, SOB milder with that exertion. Seen by Dr. Given IV Sol-u-Medrol and 50mg Benadryl. Was observed on cardiac monitor/Q15VS for a few hours and discharged home around 5:30. Given Rx of Prednisone 20mg -3tabs x2 days, 2tabs x5 days all once a days and told to take 50mg of Benadryl Q4H for the next 24 hours at least and to return prn.   I did need to stay on Benadryl, as the Sol-u-Medrol wore off some of the swelling in thr throat did return but not severe, Benadryl did help, along with taking my Asthmnex I already had. I also continued my normal HS antihistamines.  I had SOB on exertion, progressively better from the 6th-10th with it mostly resolved to yesterday. Body aches have continued but also progressively better.  Yeasterday1/12/21 the Rx of prednisone was completed and I did have some mild swelling /tingling in the throat/face/mouth return in the evening, took Benadryl 50mg again and inhaler used. I have an appointment today to seek further care at my primary doctor&#39;s office.  Asthmnax used again this morning as well, only mild tightness in the throat currently with mild body aches this whole time.

Overnight, I started to experience chills followed by extreme perspiration and weakness to the point that I struggled to open a bottle of water I had by my bed.  Tuesday, 1/12/2021:                       Headache, weak and tired but attempted to work.  I had to leave shortly after arriving because my symptoms were becoming progressively worse to the point I almost passed out from standing.  Upon arriving home, I started to experience nausea and vomiting x 3. Intense chills followed by the extreme perspiration still existed.  Most of these symptoms subsided by 9:30p that evening.

A 42-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, EL0140), intramuscular on 23Dec2020 08:00 at single dose at right arm for COVID-19 immunization; prednisone via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date to an unspecified date (for 4 days) at 50 mg for an unspecified indication. Medical history included Known allergis: latex, contrast dye. Concomitant medication included the first dose of influenza vaccine (FLU) on 30Nov2020 at single dose at right arm for immunization. Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. The patient received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported that Day 1: on 23Dec2020 08:15, the patient felt pressure behind her right eye after shot, felt in a fog, forgetful mid conversation. Day 2. (24Dec2020) Horrible headache started, fatigue. Day 3 (25Dec2020) brain zaps and brain buzzing began, headache, fatigue, numbness to right side of face to neck. By day 5 (27Dec2020) made its way to left side. Twitching of face when do certain movements. Her Dr gave her Prednisone and she took 50 mg for 4 days and stopped because she couldn&#39;t differentiate the tingling in hands and feet from shot or from that. Still brain zaps, newest issue sharp pain jolt behind eyes, left one in particular so bad she screamed and the nerves went all the way to finger tips. Her hand eye coordination was off as well and she wasn&#39;t able to be accurate on keyboard and her cursive was off. Whole body still weak, eyes hurt. Head a lot better than a day ago but still having buzzing and twitching. Today was day 18. She was awaiting an MRI with contrast on Friday hoping it got moved sooner as she was scared to what was going on. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse events included CT/MRI/Optic Nerve Scan/Pain Shot/Meds for Zaps. The events were non-serious per the reporter. Prior to vaccination, the patient wasn&#39;t diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on 28Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for prednisone was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events reported as not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of all these reported serious events might not be fully excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 42-year-old female nurse (patient) reported for herself that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot#: nurse stated she thought she had a lot# it looked like EK5703), via unspecified route at right deltoid on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure (patient had taken blood pressure medicine but hadn&#39;t taking currently because her blood pressure was being controlled). Concomitant medications included unspecified vitamins. Patient was tested positive for Covid on the 29Dec2020. She stated she didn&#39;t know about causality, she was saying no but she did have swollen lymph nodes under the right arm before getting sick (Dec2020), now she thought that might get from her vaccination but in her understanding she could get it from Covid so, she couldn&#39;t answer that, she tested positive, she didn&#39;t think it&#39;s from vaccination but her concern was because she had got the vaccination the first one then had the (Covid) infection and right now she should get the second one or not. Regarding treatment, patient stated she was taking methylprednisolone sodium succinate (SOLU-MEDROL) and salbutamol (ALBUTEROL) inhaler, taking over the counter Vitamin D3, Zinc and Vitamin C and acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN). Patient reported she did go to the physician office/ emergency room. Outcome of events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (8 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between events &#34;Tested positive for Covid/had the (Covid) infection&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / COVID-19) and  swollen lymph nodes and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded.The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the anaphylactic reaction with throat closing up and being unable to breathe or talk.

A 42-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL9261), via an unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 22Jan2021 14:58 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination and ketorolac tromethamine (TORADOL), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Jan2021 16:30 at an unknown dose, single for pain. The patient medical history includes low iron anemia from Oct2020 and allergy to eggs, pecans, walnuts and latex. Also on 15Jan2021, she fell down the stairs and thought she broke her arm and was in severe pain. The has been taking iron supplements as concomitant medications. The patient reported having hallucinations, body aches, fatigue and dizziness on Jan2021. On 22Jan2021 09:00PM, she started smelling smoke, like cigarette smoke, like her home was filling with cigarette smoke, and no one in her house even smokes. On 22Jan2021, she also had severe stomach cramps like she was going to have diarrhea, but she never did. She says she was bowed over with the worst cramps like menstrual cramps, and her left arm was in pain, more pain that it had been. She says she could feel blood surging in her legs, it was almost surreal, she could feel the blood going through her body, which she never had felt something like that before. She says that the pain was in her scapula, her left arm, all of her joints. She says she could not get comfortable, and she was crying she was in that much pain. She says she does not typically cry and has a pretty good pain tolerance. She says she was getting freaked about that, and the next morning she was exhausted (Jan2021), she would assume since she was up all night in pain (Jan2021). The following day she laid around and felt extremely fatigued and dizzy, then by Sunday she was feeling better. For pain treatment she took Ibuprofen though her doctor also prescribed her another pain pill for her arm, she was scared to take it, so she took Ibuprofen 600mg which was also prescribed to her. The patient said that she did not think it was an allergic reaction but her doctor thought it might have been. The action taken in response to the events for ketorolac tromethamine was unknown. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient reports that she received dose one of the Pfizer COVID-19 mRNA vaccine last Friday, February 5, 2021 at 2:03 PM.  She received this here at facility campus vaccine clinic.  She felt a strange tingling sensation immediately upon receiving the injection that extended from the injection site across her upper back but otherwise tolerated the injection well.  Because of her history of food allergy she was advised to remain at the vaccination clinic for 30 minutes.  During that 30-minute wait period she felt generally well however began to develop pruritus at her back in the legs.  She did not mention this to the staff at the vaccine clinic and did not look at her skin.  The pruritus was not too bothersome and she left the vaccine area after 30 minutes and walked down to our clinic to return to work.  Her pruritus intensified very quickly upon returning to her desk and within a few minutes of after her return she went into the bathroom to look at her back and had patches of red, raised, urticarial lesions across her back.  She began to feel itchy all over her body.  She remained at work and did not take any medication or seek any medical help.  She did not look at her legs.  The pruritus intensified and when she looked at her skin of her legs approximately 1 or 2 hours later she had developed urticaria essentially head to toe.  She had large confluent patches of urticaria at bilateral thighs, urticaria at her face, trunk, arms, legs.   At this point she felt otherwise well.  She went home and took 10 mg of Claritin and applied a topical Benadryl cream to her skin.  This was not helpful.  She had severe pruritus of her eyes and eyelids.  She took 50 mg of oral Benadryl which also was not particularly helpful.  Sometime in the middle of the night that night she developed chills, felt feverish, and developed intense muscle and joint aches.  She took an unknown dose of ibuprofen with minimal improvement in muscle and joint pain.  She did have improvement in fever.  Following day was Saturday, she spent the whole day in bed in extreme pain.

                                                Two days after the 2nd injection I started to have chest pain and not feel right. I went to the Station where I volunteer. I did and EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I went to the ER. They gave me 4 baby aspirin to take and some blood work. I was told the blood work showed elevated levels consistent with a blood clot as well. I had a CT scan to rule out a clot in my heart or lungs. Which it was negative. I was released and told to see a cardiologist in the next few days. I saw the cardiologist two days later who said I ended up with Pericarditis and that it should resolve on its own. I was feeling better until two days ago when I developed chest pain again. I again went to my fire station I volunteer for and did an EKG which showed Anterior Infarct. I am currently waiting for treatment from my cardiologist.

I saw the cardiologist who believed it to be sinus tackycardia as a result as an AE to  vaccine.  Felt as if my face and lips were swelling  so I took benedry and laid down again and the next morning  when I woke up and my face and lips were super swollen.  But by the 3rd day the symptoms began to subside a little.  By the 24th my HR had balanced out and I only had residual swelling around the eye area.

                                                Right sided jaw pain  started 12/22/20 in the am progressed through the evening. When I woke up I had numbness and weakness in the right of my tongue which I quickly realized included the right portion of my face. Included tongue was numb and I couldn&#39;t move it. An Er trip and CT scan confirmed it was Bells Palsy. Today,  My symptoms continue. Top of my head all the way to the  way to bottom of neck is experiencing paralysis.  Can move tongue now and it&#39;s partly numb but it&#39;s cooperating a bit more now. Nerve pain has worsened all over all the right side of face. Feels like someone  has kicked  face and I have a deep bruise.  It&#39;s a deep ache. Nothing will take away the ache away. My eye doesn&#39;t lubricate like it should. So I have to either manually close it and wet it manually or tape it closed.

Started with a rash on upper back that itched and burned for a few days, followed by whole body burning and sweating with rash on lower arms and chest along with continued rash on upper back.

No fever with the burning and sweating. No other symptoms.

A 43-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on 05Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), birth control. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for GERD, estradiol pills for birth control. The patient got the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and she had some pretty severe flu like symptoms afterwards in Jan2021. But she noticed something odd and that was her armpit was swollen. She thought that is listed as one of the side effects but she wanted to know more about it. She had a pneumococcal vaccine (Unspecified vaccine) reaction and she wanted to make sure that there was nothing that would cross reactivity associated with this vaccine (Covid19 Vaccine). The weight is like 160. About 10 hours, she got 2 or 3 symptoms. Fever, aches, headache, bad headache. That lasted about overnight on the 05Jan2021. Swelling in the arm only started on 06Jan2021. That was when the armpit got swollen. The outcome of the events were unknown.

                                                We have an employee who was vaccinated with Pfizer on 12/28/20. That evening she developed a rash on her arms that progressed to her legs and torso. The rash it itchy and burns. She still has the rash today. The next day after vaccination she experienced headache and aching that subsided within 3 days. This employee has a history of Lupus and breaking out in a rash is not uncommon for her, it is actually sort of common. When asked if this is the same sort of rash she experiences after too much sun exposure or stress (due to the Lupus) she says she would describe it as the same. She did miss one day of work due to the headache, aching, and just being miserable with the rash on top of it. She did not experience hives, trouble breathing, or swelling.

                                                Started itching within (left arm) 15 minutes. THey said I was fine and to go back to work. About an hour later, I started breaking out in hives and whole body itching. I went back in and they gave me to full strength Benadryl and it was not helping and my BP was 190/140 (stroke level) and they tried to bring that down. About 10:15 my face was starting to swell and I was short of breath and 10:30 they took me to ER - and gave me Cortisol shot. And IV fluids. And I was in ER for two hours. They wrote me a prescription for six days for 2 prednisone for every day for one week. The PA saw me at the ER and he prescribed. I went home but couldn&#39;t drive home because I couldn&#39;t see straight so got a ride home. They tested my O2 levels before they left me. Oxygen was 96. My blood pressure was down to 140/95 - so it was down but still elevated. I still had facial swelling for 3 days. But after three or four days it resolved the face swelling. Had a weakness from the shot and still itching but nothing like it was that day still after the four days.  Dr. told me I couldn&#39;t get second dose. It was an anaphalactic reaction. Dr - prescribed me an EpiPen in case I have another bad reaction to anything.

                                                Around 11:30pm 1/25, I muttered &#34;I don&#39;t feel good,&#34; which reminded me of being a child getting sick. within 30 minutes of then end escalating over the next hour, I had a severe headache, bilateral, occipital, pressure in entire head and neck. The headache as also in my eyes and in my ears.  Back was also painful - not as bad as neck, but i can&#39;t explain how horribly a hope a massage could fix me.  There was no comfortable position to alleviate any of that.  I also got the chills, constantly, suddenly switching from shivering cold to so hot i needed to take blankets off - but soon as i took the blankets off I&#39;d be freezing cold again. I was also super nauseous, though i didn&#39;t vomit. I pretty much couldn&#39;t get out of bed much for 24-36 hours. During that time, i was unable to sleep as well, i think mostly due to the chills, constantly having to move about to keep warm or cool off, but not sure.      I did take acetaminophen around 10pm 1/26 (36 hours after injection)- i felt like I knew you&#39;re not supposed to, but I couldn&#39;t take it any more and it might have less anti-inflammatory impact than ibuprofen.  It dulled the pains some, but didn&#39;t make it stop. the chills and nausea mostly stopped and was able to sleep more the second night, last night.       I&#39;m now up and trying to work today (1/27). Head still has pressure headache throughout. Neck is still sore, like a pressure headache. I feel generally foggy and heavy.

This happened a second time and then it was finished. I felt really tired and not myself.  Then later that night my arm began to hurt so bad that I could not lift it. I began to rub the area that was hurting and noticed that I now had a nice size lump there . I took a Tylenol 500mg and a hot shower. When I woke up the next morning my arm was still hurting but not as bad. When I went to use the bathroom I had began to start spotting again. This continued throughout the day and now I am bleeding as if I was having my period. I am super tired. It is to the point that i cant function at work.

I gave myself my epi-pen. I notified them and they took me to ER - IV - Benadryl and Solumedrol . I got really shaky for about an hour afterwards and then they discharged me. It cleared up my throat issues. within 4 days, I had significant shortness of breath again and I was directed to ER Gave me evaluated me for a pulmonary embolism - I did not have one. They gave me Solumedrol again. They gave me a prednisone taper. And then a week after that - or two weeks after - the shortness of breath returned  - Dr had me go to ER room again - They gave me another prednisone taper which I&#39;m still on and I have significant fatigue still and 24/7 out of breath still. Currently: Flonase 50 mg - twice a day - Admerdiscus 100 mg  - twice a day

                                                Driving home 18-20 mins post injection, my heart started racing, my hands were shaking, it became hard to breathe, my fingers were tingling and my mouth got very dry. I pulled over and called 911. The paramedics stated my BP was within normal limits of around 140/80. My normal is closer to 90/65. Once symptoms resolved I attempted to drive home. Once again, the same symptoms returned. I pulled over. I then made my way to a safe location and waited for family to come. Since the event I have had times of mild labored breathing while walking. While driving I become very anxious and the feelings of an anxiety attack return. I saw my nurse practitioner 2 days ago who referred to the driving anxiety as a form of PTSD and prescribed Prozac and Xanax. I have not take the Xanax, but have taken two nighttime doses of Prozac. Yesterday, I did not feel as though I had taken medication. My drive to work was uneventful. My drive home involved tightening of the chest, labored breathing and anxiety. This morning I cannot tell if I am feeling the vaccine or Prozac in my system, but I feel off. Swimmy headed, watery mouth, heaviness in my arms and shoulders. I need guidance on taking the 2nd vaccine or if I should seek further medical treatment. I have added a vit B vitamin a day to my regimen since the date of the vaccine.

Then, I started to feel kind of lightheaded and my legs were weak. I let the staff know and they offered me benadryl but I declined. I waited about 35 minutes then I went home. I continued to feel lightheaded and weak for about 4 hours and I also began to fill nauseous. My arm continued to be sore for a few days and I ran a fever of around 100 from the following day 1/9 and I am still running a fever now on 1/12.

A 44-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in arm left on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included cutaneous t-cell lymphoma from 2017 and ongoing, ongoing cholesterol, ongoing thyroid, covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date not ongoing (lasted about 1-1.5 months; she did not have any breathing problems) and blood cancer. Concomitant medication included bexarotene ongoing for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, rosuvastatin ongoing for cholesterol, levothyroxine ongoing for thyriod. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID 19: positive in Nov2020, found out tested positive around holiday. Clinical course: onset about 26 hours after administered the first dose; onset as soon as she got back to work next day: 06Jan2021. The side effects were at their worst for at least 24-48 hours. Further described as all side effects occurred only on left side of her body: whole left side of face swelled up on 06Jan2021; left eye turned red on 06Jan2021; whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb on 05Jan2021; eye went black/left eye looked bruised on 05Jan2021; pressure in head on 06Jan2021; felt like someone squeezing her eyeball out on 06Jan2021, within the first 24-48 hours, her &#39;left leg went numb&#39;. She called to talk to physician and nurse who advised her to take Benadryl; which she did take and the Benadryl stopped the side effects; but she could not take a lot of Benadryl or anything because she was at work. She stayed at work because at least there were healthcare professionals, adults in case she passed out; at home she has 7 young children and is also raising her grandchild. The side effects did not completely go away. The arm thing was normal; The next day she was at work and had the swelling on left side of face; blackness around the eyes; arriving home she had headaches on 07Jan2021 and then her leg went numb for like 20 mins; the whole left side of her body went numb including even her vagina; left side of her body was so numb and weird and tingly feeling that she started panicking because she was driving on 06Jan2021. She calmed herself down thinking it&#39;s only the left side; you can drive with your right side to get home and be fine. It was more like left side of her body was asleep, tingling, she has never had that happen before. Everything else like the headache, flu feeling was about 48 hours later (on 07Jan2021). She had COVID already back in Nov2020 for about 1-1.5 months; the next side effects she had were like the COVID symptoms she had, like the chills and everything on 06Jan2021. She had the lethargic feeling again, her head was hurting, she felt extremely weak on 06Jan2021. Patient also felt nausea on 06Jan2021, Dizzy on 08Jan2021. Another doctor said it sounded like the side effects she experienced with the vaccine sounded like allergic reaction or Bell&#39;s palsy. Patient was asking the doctor if she could get like an Epi-pen or prescription Benadryl or something because she is afraid to get the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine and not have something to respond to side effects with. The outcome of event whole face went numb/left side of face slightly numb was recovered on 07Jan2021, for headaches was recovering, chills and nausea was recovered on 08Jan2021. Outcome of other events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Received injection in left deltoid around 3 pm. At about 9:00 am my left axillary lymph node was the size of a quarter. It was very sore and painful to touch and movement. Pain scale 7/10. I treated it with warm compress infused with lavender oil, Ibuprofen 400 mg orally, self-massage, and rest.

                                                2nd shot: Very different experience. Got the shot in my left arm after work like before. I had a headache and felt tired so took some melatonin, had a hot toddy, and went to bed early. Woke up roughly 18 hours post vaccine with back aches and lower rib pain when I took a breath. Took my temp, it was 100*.  By 21 hours I had a temp of 102*.  My groin, neck, and left arm pit lymph nodes were enlarged as well. After sleeping most of the day away, it felt like my fever &#39;broke&#39; at 28 hours, it came down to 101*.  Finally I took some Tylenol at 34 hours so I could sleep from the back pain.  Woke up the next morning at 45 hours with a stiff back/neck but temp down to 99*.  I also had a swollen and reddened entire deltoid where the shot had been given (painless when shot given and no blood after), almost like a cellulitis or allergic reaction.  My left armpit lymph node remains enlarged but not as painful. Now almost 72 hours out, the only residual effects are a decreasing but enlarged left armpit lymph node, improving swollen/reddened deltoid, decreased appetite, and decreased energy level.

                                                48 hours after vaccine, at 3 pm, I developed an allergic response. I had diarrhea, hives, itchy eyes, mouth, and throat, coughing, and slight constriction in my lungs. Within 30 minutes of taking Benadryl the symptoms began to subside. After the allergic reaction, I developed the normal symptoms of the vaccine with chills, fever, body aches and a headache. Injection site had increased soreness for the rest of the day.

I had pain in the wrist arm, joints and fingers. I determined it was due to the swelling.  I had some lymph node enlargement, and was really fatigue and slept most of the day. (36 hours).  I did not have a fever.  I&#39;m a doctor and did some evaluations  on myself. I didn&#39;t have trouble breathing of swallowing.  If I wasn&#39;t medically trained I would have gone into the doctor.  I did see an ENT for hearing test to make sure there was no damage and there was not.

This 44-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: E19266) via intramuscular at single dose on 20Feb2021 09:30 for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was on 30Jan2021 in left arm. Medical history included splenectomy from Feb2017; pancreatic surgery from Feb2017, they removed her spleen as part of that; soy allergy; poultry allergy. Patient confirmed she had splenectomy. The surgery was sort of emergency based so knowing most likely they were taking her spleen out; she was given 4 vaccinations. In the hospital, she did break out in what appeared to be like a chicken pox type rash. The rash lasted a month and then it started to fade. She did not have any breathing sort of symptoms. The doctors did attribute the rash to one of the vaccinations, she was not clear on what vaccine caused the reaction. Ideally, she was supposed to have 2 weeks prior to the surgery so her body had time to reabsorb but she did not have that kind of time, but she had nothing internally going on. She confirmed she had no names, NDC, Lot number or expiration dates for the vaccines she received at that point in time. Having the splenectomy was the biggest thing. In the past, she did not have any allergies to medications, but did have allergies to soy and poultry. She did break out from certain food and her skin develops those blotches. She did have an extra work up in Feb2020, where they tested a bunch of food sensitivities and allergies, and nothing came back. This was right before COVID hit so she did not really follow back up after that, but she was tested for all major foods and household things and nothing came up. In her late 20&#39;s, she definitely tested for a soy allergy and allergy to poultry. She did check off yes, she had a reaction previously when she was filling out the form at the COVID-19 vaccine site knowing that she had this prior experience. She was held 30 minutes each time for that reason. Concomitant medication was none. Prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was no. On 20Feb2021, patient was very faint, thought she was going to pass out, eyes were watering, blotches on her neck and chest, tingly experience on her tongue and lips, severely shaking, overwhelming chills, extreme nausea. On an unspecified date, patient experienced headache, general weakness, in her legs especially, no energy, no appetite, chills that come and go, diarrhea and green colored stools. Patient received her second shot of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine on 20Feb2021. She had had symptoms ever since. She had a reaction on site at the vaccine center. She eventually had to go to the Emergency Room by ambulance. Her symptoms were still going on and tomorrow would mark a week since she received the second dose. The symptoms she experienced on site were different than what she was currently experiencing. She felt like she had a true reaction at the vaccine facility site. Within 6 minutes of receiving the second vaccine, she became very faint, her eyes were watering. She thought she was going to pass out for a bit. She was told she had blotches on her neck and chest. She had a tingly experience on her tongue and lips. She was severely shaking and had overwhelming chills. She stated this happened for a couple of hours. Basically, there were 3 waves of these symptoms kind of happening. The third wave happened probably a couple hours after receiving the vaccine. At that point, she had been given two pills of diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), taken orally. With the third wave, she thought she was going to pass out, which she thought multiple times before, but then with this particular wave, she experienced extreme nausea which was kind of a new symptom. The doctor on site said to the EMT that he wanted her to go to the Emergency Room. Patient confirmed she was taken to the ER via ambulance the day she received the vaccine, 20Feb2021. She was never admitted into the hospital; she was only seen in the Emergency Room for a couple of hours. She was given IV fluids, she had blood work done. She didn&#39;t have a copy of her labs but she was told they were okay. She was injected with diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) via IV before she was released. A lot more symptoms came after she was released from the hospital (ER). She came home and she had just a crazy headache that she really woke up with every single day until this morning. She had been taking a lot of caffeine/paracetamol (EXCEDRIN, Lot#: H044G, Expiry Date: Jun2022) for her headaches. She experienced extreme weakness, nausea. She clarified she had weakness in her legs. She had this exhaustion, and she felt this general weakness sort of in her legs especially. She was still taking stuff for a headache, and she was taking nausea pills. She had been out of work all week. She had no energy, no appetite really. She had chills that come and go. She had diarrhea. She clarified she had more diarrhea in the beginning days after receiving the vaccine, but it was always been a green colored stool as well. The ER called and checked in and were very surprised she had been having the symptoms still so severely. They wanted her to go get an actual COVID test. She went to the Urgent Care to get COVID tested on 23Feb2021 and had a rapid and PCR test. The rapid test came back negative. She had not received the results for the PCR test yet. She was taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride but she stopped taking that. The hospital directed her stop taking the diphenhydramine hydrochloride earlier in the week. She clarified she was taking a generic version (Lot#: P113966, Expiry Date: Feb2021), coated mini tablets. She clarified the nausea pills she had been taking was the generic for ZOFRAN, ondansetron 4 mg tablet, by mouth, every 8 hours. She confirmed this product was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle with no NDC, Lot number or expiry date on it. She clarified she also had been taking the generic version of TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH, it was the Up and Up Brand acetaminophen (Lot#: P122699, Expiry Date: Nov2022) gel caps, 500mg. COVID-19 rapid test was negative on 23Feb2021; COVID-19 PCR test on 23Feb2021 was unknown results. Patient asked if there was a hotline she can call or an information number where she can talk to somebody about her symptoms. She also reported this to her doctor but the doctor made it clear since it was a private practice, they had limited information. The doctor did take down similar information, she just did not know if there was any further information or a hotline she could call. The outcome of events was unknown.

A 44-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm, on 07Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Relevant medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s disease from 2017 and ongoing, cosmetic filler injections got in her face within the last year and half or 2 years. Patient said that she knew that Allergan asked her doctor about her ongoing Hashimoto&#39;s as well. She takes medication for that. Patient also said that her white blood cell count runs low, like around 2 if they want to note that as an immune system thing and she confirmed that was an issue for her prior to receiving the COVID 19 vaccine. Family medical history included that her daughter has Hasimotos as well. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications for Hashimoto&#39;s disease. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EI1685) via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 18Dec2020 at the year of 44 years at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. She said her doctor believes she is having a reaction with her fillers. She clarified fillers were like cosmetic injections got in her face. She thought the filler was called Allergan but she didn&#39;t have any other information about it. She did know her doctor did call Allergan and did a report with them. She thought it was like a big deal because it was not documented with Pfizer just with Moderna. She said the doctor was also going to call and report this as well. The doctor has not called yet but he said he was going to, she just left their office. Basically the places she had had filler injections within the last year and half or 2 years not have, under her right eye there was a large bump that was swollen and then the places that were called labial folds, the marionette lines where she had had filler there were all swollen and that was on the right side of her face and then on the left side the marionette lines were swollen as well so basically everywhere she had had filler injections were swollen except the left eye, the left eye is not swollen. And the places were swollen and hard. She first noticed the swelling yesterday 25Jan2021. The bump on her right eye was yesterday around 15:00 and then this morning (26Jan2021) it was much worse under her eye and she noticed the bumps on the right side at about 6 am this morning and around 9 am she began feeling it on the left side and it progressively has gotten worse since it started in all of those areas (26Jan2021). This case reported as serious. Patient did not visit Emergency Room, but she has been to 2 different physicians in physician office. No other vaccines administered on the same day as either dose of the suspect product. Patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Outcome of the events was not recovered.    Reporter assessed event everywhere she had had filler injections are swollen except the left eye, her left eye is not swollen as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information a contributory role of BNT162B2 to reported events cannot be fully excluded. Consideration should also be given to the contribution from the cosmetic filler injections. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Around 6pm I started with a slight headache and by 8pm i had trouble keeping my eyes open.  (headache is not uncommon for me but the extreme drowsiness is).   I slept solid through the night (unusual) and the puppy woke me around 5am. (ususal)  I felt that i had a heavy? head.  My thoughts seemed clear but my head had a fullness to it.  Its difficult to describe.  I was not stuffy.  I had trouble staying awake, to the point I was nodding off at times I should have been able to stay awake.  I did not feel safe to work and felt obligated to call in.  I slept solidly for the next 5 hours.  Later in the day, my affected arm began to have pain radiate from the injection site to my wrist.  (probably not unusual).  600mg of Ibuprofen did not seem to help much.  By the time I went to bed last night (24&#43; hrs after receiving the vaccine) I noticed my axillary nymph nodes were extremely tender to the touch and remain so this morning.  The pain in my arm still continues to radiate to my wrist but not as intense.

                                                I got the vaccine on 12/18/20 on my left arm and on 12/28/20, 10 days after I started to have pain on my upper left arm and the next day the pain went to my armpit, back and forth from my upper left arm to my armpit and this went on for at least 5 days.  On 01/02/21, 15 days after I notice red bumps on my upper left arm and as days went on red bumps show in my armpit, left back, and chest. The pain went from sharp to burning. On 01/06/21 I got the 2nd dose of the vaccine and I told the injection person about the red bumps. I told him that they look like hives. He spoke with the medical doctor about it and doctor said it was ok for me to get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. They think it was a delayed reaction.  They have me monitored for 30 mins after the 2nd dose of the injection before I leave the site. I still have pain and red bumps so I went to see my primary doctor on 01/07/21.  The doctor said that I have shingles. I told him that I never had shingles before and he said maybe the vaccine trigger it. He prescribed me some medications for the shingles.  I don?t know if the vaccine trigger the shingles or just coincidence but I want to report this maybe someone might have the same experience. Thank you.

My lymph nodes are swelling and I am concerned since I never had my lymph nodes swell up. On my second injection 01-06-2021, I continue with lymph node swelling and my symptoms do not seem to go away. I went to see my doctor, that said  it was probably a reaction to the Pfizer injection and he is recommending that in February 2021,  if I still have swelling to my lymph nodes then lab work will be performed.

Then around 1030 she started to have lower chest (near the lower ribs) pain 9/10 pain and she was diaphoretic. We called 911 as we were concerned about an MI.

On 1/8/21, Patient reports that she feels dizzy and is &#34;itching all over.&#34; She took antihistamine and that helped the itching symptom.

A 45-year-old female patient receive the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number: Ek9231), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 31Dec2020 09:00 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included lupus.The patient also had allergies to penicillin (PCN). It was also mentioned that the patient COVID twice (Mar2020 until 2020&amp;Nov2020 until 2020). Concomitant medications included lisdexamfetamine mesilate (VYVANSE) and bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN). It was reported that the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient reported that she had a very slight reaction after administration &amp; took diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). She described that approximately at the 11-hour mark (31Dec2020 20:00), her arm was getting so sore and she couldn&#39;t lift it. Within a few hours, she lost the ability to move it at all. Also, she was getting overwhelmed with fatigue &amp; she had a feeling that can best be described as the feeling of death entering my bones. Every bone hurt and her ribs were so sore she couldn&#39;t take deep breaths. The patient would wake up crying in pain &amp; her pain tolerance was very high. She felt nauseous &amp; dizzy and was the worst night of her life. She took acetaminophen (APAP) 1000mg &amp; meloxicam 15mg that night with no relief. She narrated that she had COVID twice (Mar &amp; Nov) &amp; that night that she experienced; she would rather have COVID 1000 more times than ever have this pain she was in.

At 70 minutes after shot administration, felt itchy on limbs, then trunk and neck, then ears, eyes and into scalp. Symptoms progressed over the next 2 hours (flushed neck and then lips felt tingly and numb). At 7:30 my soft palate started to feel numb and I started to have some difficulty swallowing. Went to ER. Symptoms continued. After IV meds given swallowing difficulty continued to worsen so I was given a low dose shot of Epi. Swallowing improved (not to normal but not as severe) over the next hour but itchiness returned. It is now 8:00pm on 1/9/2021 and I continue to have itchiness, my tongue and soft palate are still numb but I am able to swallow fairly well and my entire face has decreased sensation to touch.

A 45-year-old female patient received BNT162B2, (Pfizer COVID Vaccine, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: Apr2021) intramuscular on an unspecified date at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included nortriptyline for migraine, botulinum toxin type a (BOTOX) for migraine and birth control medication.  The patient stated that, &#34;I was wondering if this was a reaction to the vaccination I had today. So I ended up 3 hours after I received the vaccine, I got very hot and clammy but at the same time had the goosebumps and then my whole body was as if I was sun burnt and my heart started to race. And then my whole body was red as if I had a sunburn. Actually I went to the ER today and they just did lab work because of the way I was feeling. All they gave me in the emergency room is IV fluids.&#34;  Therapeutic measures taken as a result of the events included IV fluids. The outcome of the events was unknown.

By midnight the symptoms had started to reoccur. I took another 50 mg of Benadryl. I finished the medrol dose pack on Wednesday, January 13th but still have the raw sensation on my tongue.

                                                About 25 min after receiving the vaccine, I noticed a little tingling on my lips and my cheeks and my face felt heavy. I looked myself in the mirror, my face, cheeks and neck became very red like beet red and warm to the touch. I returned to the vaccine site and they observed me but the symptoms worsened, my eyes started getting puffy/ my cheeks started getting purple instead of red, and they sent me to the ER. At the ER they continued to monitor me and gave me IV Benadryl and IV Pepcid and IV steroids and said I had a delayed case of hives. Once I had all the IV medication the swelling went down and the hives on my arms and my back went away, the redness in my face and neck stayed until next day and I noticed after taking a warm shower the next day the redness returned on other parts of my body. I took a Benadryl. About after 2 days it was all resolved.

                                                I felt mostly fine all day.  A little tired and my arm was sore.  About 4:45pm, I started sweating and getting really hot.  I felt like I might need to use the restroom (soon) and I was at the grocery store.  So, I immediately left.  My house is 5-7 minutes from the store.  During this time, I experienced terrible pains in my stomach and lower abdomen.  I barely made it through my door and had to run to my bathroom.  I experienced diarrhea like I?ve never experienced in my life.  It was painful and explosive.  This lasted about 30 minutes on and off.  Mostly on.  Once I cleaned myself up, I was very tired and weak.  I felt nauseous this entire night but have not had any other episodes.  I also have not invested anything except water since this happened.

A 45-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), intramuscular in left arm on 31Dec2020 at 08:15 AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a workplace clinic.  Medical history included mild asthma and known allergies to bee stings.  There were no concomitant medications.  Within a few minutes of the vaccine on 31Dec2020, the patient felt a &#34;closing in&#34; sensation and then her pulse and blood pressure went up. She developed a severe headache and hot flushing with chest tightness. The medical team gave her epinephrine in right thigh and she felt a bit better. Then she started getting pale, sweating, and peripheral perfusion worsened so she was given a second dose of epi. She started feeling better, but had a headache, palpitations and &#34;brain fog&#34; for about 5 days after and she still having intermittent dizziness (unspecified date). The patient received epinephrine IM and benadryl IV push for the events. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient has no COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks and other medications in two weeks. The patient recovered from the events with lasting effects. The patient had not yet recovered from the event dizziness, while the patient recovered with sequelae for the remaining events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported events were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to plausible temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Mentioned it got worse yesterday and it&#39;s staying about the same today with the swelling and is very uncomfortable (Jan2021) and is persisting. Causality not provided. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccines in the past. Vaccination Facility Type was Clinic. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Events reported as medically significant.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for events swollen lymph nodes and lymph node pain.

I had axilla lymphadenopathy, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, muscle pain and periods of tachycardia when standing.  This lasted for 7 days.  The lymphadenopathy was diagnosed in a routine mammogram/ultrasound screening 9 days after the vaccine.  I finally started feeling better the week I was scheduled to receive my second shot.  I got my second shot on 1/14/2021.  Within 12 hours, I had a 101 fever and muscle aches.  I also had axilla lymphadenopathy.  Within 3 days, I was feeling better, however about 8 days post vaccine, I started to experience bouts of tachycardia and dizziness again.  As time progresses, these symptoms are slowly improving.

                                                COVID-19 pneumonia; COVID-19 pneumonia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient) from a Pfizer-sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs). A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EK570), via an unspecified route of administration in the left upper arm on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none and there were no concomitant medications.  The patient stated that she felt yucky afterwards on 23Dec2020, experienced shortness of breath on exertion and coughing on 26Dec2020; chills, dizziness, headache, muscle pain, body aches, fever on 28Dec2020; loss of taste, loss of smell and COVID-19 pneumonia on 07Jan2021.  All the events were reported as being medically significant.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: positive on 29Dec2020.  Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of COVID-19 pneumonia and included: started on bronchodilator, cough elixir, steroids and azithromycin (ZITHROMAX).  The outcome of muscle pain, body aches and COVID-19 pneumonia was recovering and of loss of taste and loss of smell was not recovered.  The causality of the suspect vaccine to the events was reported as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

A 45-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 17Feb2021 10:46 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history included renal failure which she has had since 17Feb2020 and she was on dialysis which started on 04Dec2020. She had had a prior renal transplant before which was on 12Aug2004. Concomitant medications included prednisone, nifedipine (PROCARDIA [NIFEDIPINE]), clonidine, sevelamer, tacrolimus, carvedilol and repaglinide; all were taken from an unspecified date for an unspecified indication. She was on current medication for that for the renal failure. However, at the time of the vaccine her regular medication was on hold, she did not take it because she wanted to do the vaccine. The patient&#39;s mother reported that on 17Feb2021 her daughter has been having a lot of difficulty, she couldn&#39;t speak, she can&#39;t speak properly, unable to speak very clearly. She lost her voice completely/loss of voice, coughing, itchy throat, very hoarse voice, her voice goes and comes, and she got very dark in her face. The patient&#39;s mother thought that her daughter was having a stroke. The patient&#39;s mother also thought that the patient was going to die. She added that her daughter went to the ER and she still has problems and she could have died. She had an allergic reaction from the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She took the Pfizer vaccine at 10:46 AM. She can&#39;t speak now if she does it strains her voice then she was more hoarse. She said after the vaccine this occurred about 30 or 45 minutes. The patient was terrified, she was frightened because she wasn&#39;t able to speak. She had coughing, itchy throat, unable to speak clearly. The patient stated that she was dying. They had to get her to the hospital and she stayed over night for observation. She was discharged the next day, she stayed over night because they gave her medications they had to watch and take her vitals and blood work and they came back normal it was just the hoarseness but she had a bad allergic reaction. They gave her a lot of medications to go home on. She said that on 17Feb2021 she went to the hospital and she was discharged home 18 Feb2021. They were doing an EKG, a chest Xray, blood work, those test were being done to make sure her respiratory was okay. She had no swelling, no enlargement or they would have admitted her but all of that was normal and she was discharged home on 18Feb2021 on Solumedrol, Albuterol, Pepcid, Benadryl, Claritin. She had a terrible allergy. She said she was not admitted to the hospital they kept her for observation and she stayed in the emergency room for observation. They gave her an EpiPen. They discharged her home with an EpiPen and Prednisone 40 mg for 4 days. She said that the doctor said if you have an allergy, go to the nearest hospital and that was all being done. She asked what happens now because the patient was supposed to get a second dose but the patient&#39;s mother doesn&#39;t think so since the patient was terrified. The patient&#39;s mother said the vaccine was causing a lot of big allergies up there. She confirmed that it was her daughter experienced. Coughing itchy throat, loss of voice, unable to speak very clearly, and her face was very dark. She said hopefully someone will get back to her. She said the loss of voice after so many days, it has been 7 days now and her voice that way frightens the patient&#39;s mother. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 46-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right deltoid on 30Dec2020 08:15 at a single dose for vaccination. The patient&#39;s medical history included tested positive for COVID-19 from Jul2020. There were no concomitant medications. Around 30Dec2020 9:00 AM, she began experiencing extreme nausea and dizziness, extreme fatigue, different waves of chills to the point of she could not even move, sweating, severe headache, and just crap now. The patient&#39;s physician told that this is something she should report. It could possibly have been an immune response because she had possibly been exposed to COVID-19 that she probably had some sort of antibodies from then until now on Dec2020, even though she tested negative for COVID-19 and continued to test negative for COVID-19 on 2020. She smells metal on Dec2020. She has no sense of smell other than stinky metallic smell. Her taste is fine. Outcome of the headache was not recovered, of the metallic smell was unknown, of the remaining events was recovered on 30Dec2020 13:00.

A 46-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 22Dec2020 10:30 at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ectopic pregnancy, hay fever. Concomitant medication received within 2 weeks included: loratadine, colecalciferol (vitamin D), olly womens multivitamin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No known allergies. About 15 minutes after the vaccine the patient experienced jaw tightening and muscle spasms. The patient was given oral Benadryl 50 mg. About 5 minutes after taking the Benadryl, her entire face and around her mouth went numb. The patient began having heart palpitations and felt a wave of heat rush up her back. She had hives on her chest. The patient received 1 dose of epinephrine from an Epi-Pen and transported to the emergency room for further treatment. Adverse event start date: 22Dec2020 11:00 AM. Events were considered as non-serious. Events resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event included: Benadryl, Epinephrine, Solumedrol, Pepcid. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. Test Name: SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (Nasal Swab) on 30Dec2020: Negative. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The temporal relationship is suggestive of an acute anaphylactic reaction. Based on the temporal relationship and the known pattern of response, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                15 minutes and 21 seconds after shot was given, I felt suddenly very hot, lightheaded and I could feel my pulse escalating. Nurse in the post-shot monitoring tent took vitals to confirm pulse at 95, when typically 68. I was laid down and BP dropped to 110/78. Chest tightness that I am familiar with from asthma started to develop and my neck and throat and upper shoulders felt very tight and constricted. I had some trouble swallowing water as though my throat was constricted and my breathing felt shallow. Nurses provided care and I was asked to get up and sit in a chair again. Within a minute, I felt dizzy and disoriented again and heart rate went up. The tightness in my chest and throat and shallow breathing continued along with my voice becoming hoarse.  The doctor on call asked if I?d had these symptoms before and I said I had after eating shrimp years ago. He decided to transfer me to the ER for monitoring . I stayed at the ER for about an hour and a half and was monitored. The constricted throat and asthma  chest tightness did not subside but did not get worse. Doctor recommended Benadryl every 6 hours as symptoms persisted. Within a half hour of taking 25 mg of Benadryl, I started to feel improved breathing and less throat constriction and easier swallowing. After the second dose of Benadryl, symptoms were much 70% gone, except for hoarse voice abs very slight tightness with swallowing.  I had informed the injection staff prior to receiving my vaccine that I am a person with a history of anaphylaxis (not to a vaccine) that required and epi pen and overnight hospital stay in the past .

                                                About 5 min after receiving vaccine - had just sat down after vaccine and had a weird sensation: like felt like rushed through my body and then instantly my heart started racing and I felt it thump into my throat. Let nurse in attendance know and she took me to another area secluded from others and told me to relax. Sat down. Hooked me up to monitors; blood pressure cuff  and  finger pulse and she left to go get someone and she brought EMT back with her. Felt tight in chest; in neck felt like there&#39;s tightening; but could still breathe; felt heavy: chest. Neck felt tight. Felt like I needed an inhaler. I don&#39;t have it with me as I only have asthma in spring and fall. They kept telling me to calm down and I wasn&#39;t feeling nervous. I was trying to relax. EMT asked questions and he said that the same thing happened to him. He told me I couldn&#39;t leave  Event Center until things calmed down for me. Released her when I felt fine but was just really tired and kind of shaky. I felt so exhausted. Told EMT that and he told me he would feel that way if he had just ran a marathon. I had slept 12 hours the night before. He didn&#39;t tell me what my heartrate went up to.  I left event center  at 9:49 pm. Started feeling strange again when doing errands and was at store afterwards (about 30 or 40 min later) - nauseous; dizzy; sweaty, clammy. Heart was racing again. I told husband I didn&#39;t feel right. Felt like I needed to sit because I was shaky. Left and went to vehicle. As we sat in car, I told him something wasn&#39;t feeling right. Mouth was so dry. He started driving. I felt like we were driving down a tunnel.Husband looked at me and said you don&#39;t look right either. Took me to ER in nearest hospital: blood pressure high; heart rate elevated; ER           (Hospital) The doctor did lab work. Triponin levels elevated; potassium levels low - sign of a heart episode and needed to get in control. Gave me potassium and took  more blood work and troponin levels started coming down. Dr advised me not to go back to get second dose. Personal Care Dr confirmed that I shouldn&#39;t get the 2nd dose - put in my records that I am allergic to this vaccine.  The next day I had severe diarrhea and terrible pain in my arm that went all the way down and up into my neck and whole right side head hurt. (really bad headache). Extreme fatigue. Went back to work on the following Monday evening and was exhausted doing my job. When I say family Dr on Tuesday, I didn&#39;t want to be taken off work because I was in the right place where people could take care of me and I&#39;d taken time off at holidays. That entire week was a lot of exhaustion and tiredness.

Over next 2 days pain back of legs, which then evolved into burning and then numbness of palms of hands, soles of feet.  Reported to me on 1/8.  Over last 3 days, she has had slow improvement with slight tingling and numbness fingers.  Over weekend, I had her get tested for COVID - both rapid and PCR neg. She went to ED for testing, and they also ran CT head and labs -- negative.  She made appt with neurologist today and will follow up with her PCP. Testing for COVID was to rule out as cause for peripheral neuropathy.  Might be due to vaccine vs some other undiagnosed condition including autoimmune. Due to the unique nature of this complaint, may be considered Adverse Reaction

                                                After waiting in the waiting area for about 20 minutes following the vaccination, I left to return to my car and go home.  While walking through the hospital, I started to feel weird - almost light headed and fuzzy.  By the time I got to the hospital entrance, my tongue had started to tingle and swell (I don&#39;t know that it ACTUALLY swelled, but that&#39;s how it felt) and I was concerned about losing the ability to breath.  I started going back to the vaccination site, but the feeling started to subside.  After about another 15 minutes, the feeling was gone.  I did NOT report this to the vaccination site and instead just proceeded home.

At about 1:45am on 1/13/2021, was feeling very achy and uncomfortable, so I went downstairs to get some Tylenol. Rapid heart rate and sweating, so much I had to sit down in the kitchen for a few minutes. Eventually took the Tylenol, and as I was heading back upstairs, I passed out (I don&#39;t remember going down to the floor) and dropped the cup of water I was taking with me. Was out for less than 30 seconds. A couple episodes of heaving/vomiting small amounts of liquid while on the floor. Made it back to bed and was starting to feel improved around 4:00am.

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 in deltoid left at single dose for covid-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications.  Family medical history relevant to event was none. Relevant tests were none. Patient reported she received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 06Jan2021 and had pain at the injection site. On 07Jan21 she started having muscle aches and got something that look like hives on the arm and her skin felt really hot to touch, it was fire engine red on the right upper arm. On 08Jan2021, she woke up and felt like she got hit by a tractor trailer, has severe aches, voice very raspy, and very wiped out with headaches.  Patient mentioned injection site arm was bright red and warm to touch after injection, but has improved. When waking up this morning on 08Jan2021 even walking this morning from the bedroom to the bathroom she was fatigued and it has gotten better with her walking around, but she still felt wiped out. The muscle aches was very short lived. She went to do something at work and it took a minute for her to catch her breath and that and the muscle aches went away and that was it. An hour later she felt very flushed and itchy and coworkers joked with her about what she ate for lunch, which was nothing different. On the opposite arm from injection arm she had hives on the lower right arm. They were there about 15-20 minutes and it turned completely fire engine red and that lasted about half an hour. She showed the doctor she worked with and they recommended diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), which she didn&#39;t take, it was weird. All this subsided and she felt fine afterwards. Last night she felt very fatigued when walking around the house. This morning when she woke up she felt very, very, very fatigued. Walking took a lot of effort out of her. It is hard to explain, but people say this was how they felt when they had Covid. She felt very lethargic and very tired. Patient still had a lingering headache, but nothing like she felt earlier this morning. It&#39;s not terrible, but it wasn&#39;t pleasant for a couple of hours. Patient was unable to provide seriousness for today&#39;s events (08Jan2021), and stated it wasn&#39;t really life threatening, but more significant than yesterday. Patient denied having any other vaccines the same day or 4 weeks prior. No history of problems or adverse events with vaccines in past. Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with events were reported as related.  Events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. Outcome of severe aches, voice very raspy, headache/lingering headache, wiped out /fatigued/tired were not recovered; outcome of lethargic, it took a minute for her to catch her breath, flushed and itchy was unknown, and outcome of other events were recovering.

                                                Hello,   When I received my second Covid vaccine, I was asked to report my side effects to this email address.  They are as follows:   After Vaccine 1 (12/22/20):  I had the vaccine at around 1:30pm.  I only had arm-stiffness at first.  Approx. 24 hours after however (1:30pm the next day), I started having chills and feeling like I had a fever.  My entire body ached but I did not have a headache.  These side effects lasted through the night for approx. 14 hours.   The following day I woke up with a surge of energy and felt very much like I had been given a shot of adrenalin.  I?m not sure that I have ever felt as good.   After Vaccine 2 (01/11/21):  I had much more severe side effects after the second vaccine.  I had this vaccine at approx. 1:30 pm and within a couple of hours I started to feel a bit tired.  At approx. midnight that night, I started having body aches and a headache that woke me up.  I had chills and was oscillating between feeling very cold and feeling very hot.  Through the night I had to change my clothing several times due to sweating.  These symptoms lasted for the entire following day.  The second day after the vaccine I felt much better but still a little tired.    Of greatest concern is that I have a lingering pain deep within my left arm (the arm into which the shots were given).  Having a hard time extending my arm and doesn;t seems to be going away.  Sometimes it feels tingly and I sometimes have loss of grip and/or weakness in the entire arm.     Hope this helps you in compiling the side effects.  Thank you.

Taken to ER approximately 25-30 after injection for evaluation. Symptoms not escalating, eventually treated with Benadryl, steroids and Pepcid, held briefly for observation, released with Claritin and steroid prescription to take for the next few days.  I was instructed to premedicate for the 2nd dose. Approximately 5-6 hours after dose developed tightness in chest, tingling face/lips/mouth/fingers. Symptoms persist still, self medicating with Benadryl and klonapin.

                                                I received the second dose of the vaccine on Tuesday morning, and took 800 mg ibuprofen afterward to ward off arm soreness. I had quite a bit of pain at the injection site with this vaccine,  more severe than the initial dose. I felt the same mild fatigue and headache as with the first dose, but yesterday (Thursday (01/20/21) afternoon, around 3-4pm), I noticed soreness in my right axillary area, and found lymphadenopathy with palpation. I took additional ibuprofen and tylenol, and the pain has lessened somewhat today (Friday 01/22/21, noon)

A 46-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (lot: EL3247, Expiry Date: May2021), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 15Jan2021 at 0.3 mL, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included food allergic. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced allergic reaction on 15Jan2021. The patient alerted she wasn&#39;t feeling well a few minutes after receiving vaccine. The patient was experiencing being flushed, had a fast heart rate, and her heart rate kept increasing over time, despite two benadryl, the patient had allergic reactions in the past due to food, so the patient knew what it felt like, so could expect it, so the patient spoke up soon, and the Epipen was given 28-30 minutes later, and after that, the patient said her throat felt thick and she had trouble swallowing, so was taken to the hospital. The patient seemed to be getting worse, after time, after the Epipen. The patient was most likely admitted to the hospital. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of reported events cannot be excluded.

Still feeling slightly dizzy and tired, but better overall, just feel slightly &#34;off&#34;, especially with exertion.  BP: 1/23 - 98/76 HR84 , 104/83, HR77; 1/24 - 102/82, HR87; 1/25 - 109/75, HR68, 104/67, HR58, 98/79,HR104, 96/74, HR93; 1/26 - 94/69, HR81, 95/72, HR74, 98/64, HR80; 1/27 - 121/84, HR81 (during MD video visit), 114/80, HR75, 96/74, HR82. Spoke to my doctor today.  She asked if I&#39;d filled out this form so decided to fill out.

                                                Within a few minutes of vaccine, I got a severe piercing headache and nausea / vomiting which we attributed to nerves and I went to go home without reporting. During the drive the headache and nausea got worse and my extremities and face began to tingle. My chest felt tight. My body was shaking. My colleague noted weak pulses and pale complexion. I am a doctor and gave myself epinephrine 0.3 mg IM and within 60 to 90 seconds the symptoms improved dramatically. I had my husband pick me up at the office and went home. The headache and nausea worsened on the drive but then settled down significantly. I rested for a few hours, then took oral pred 20 mg at about 2:45. I noticed that my headache was back and very intense at about 3:15 pm. No nausea this time, but my left eye began itching and it was very tight / hard to breathe. My extremities began tingling and I had spasms / tremors of my muscles. I injected another 0.3 mg epi into my thigh and followed with dex sodium phosphate 4 mg IM. Symptoms resolved within about 2 to 3 minutes. I took 40mg more of oral pred. I also took 10 mg of pepcid PO.   I am still feeling well now with no headaches or other symptoms at this writing (7:30 pm), but I have another doctor with me and we are 2 minutes from the ER if needed. I am marking unknown below since it has only been a few hours without symptoms.

                                                Throat swelling; severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine; chills; sweats; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from two contactable physicians. A 46-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9267), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 at a single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included herpes Simplex I, back pain, SI joint dysfunction, difficulty sleeping and allergy to raw tomatoes. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 13Feb2021, the patient experienced throat swelling, severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine, chills, sweats, nausea, the seriousness of throat swelling, severe allergic reaction was reported as hospitalization, seriousness of the other events was reported as medically significant.  Under anaphylaxis that the patient has EpiPen at home for raw tomatoes Clinical course: she had a severe reaction to the first shot presenting the following side effects: chills, sweats  and nausea within 5 minutes and then developed throat swelling within 10 minutes, the patient was administered with an EpiPen, Benadryl and was sent to the ER where she received Benadryl IV monitored, eventually her symptoms diminished from 10 of 10 to a 6 in a scale of 10, the patient also received Prednisone 40 mg everyday for 4 days. She did have nausea and sweats. It was six out of ten in the ER. Then it went to four or five out of ten. It took four to five days to get back to normal. By five days after the vaccination she was back to normal. She had a virtual visit with a patient who apparently had a severe reaction after the first vaccine. It was set up in physical therapy office.  HCP wants to know if it is safe for the patient to receive the second dose of the vaccine. HCP mentioned that this is her first patient who has a severe allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine. She was feeling better. She was told to call her doctor about getting the second shot. The bottom line is if they acted as severely as they did she would think the answer would be not to get the second. She was better. She felt fine. She has an allergy to raw tomatoes. She knows she is not supposed to have raw tomatoes. A couple of days ago she had a dressing that must have had raw tomatoes in it because she had throat swelling. The patient said what happened with Pfizer was more. She knew it when it was happening because it has happened before. She had no hypoxia. The patient reported that her pulse ox was checked and was in the high 90&#39;s. The patient was able to swallow. No drooling. She did have nausea and sweats. It was six out of ten in the ER. Then it went to four or five out of ten. It took four to five days to get back to normal. By five days after the vaccination she was back to normal. On 23Nov2020, the patient weighed 150 pounds and her height was 66 inches. The outcome of events was recovering.  There is a causality, because it happened with 5 to 10 minutes after receiving the vaccination. She had to wait for 15 minutes. The patient had chills, sweats, and nausea within 5 minutes. She felt fine upon immediately receiving and then within 5 minutes she had chills, sweat, nausea, headache. Then within 5 to 10 minutes throat swelling.

                                                In the first 5 mins after the injection I became very irritable and then within 10 mins had a cold sensation in my head that I had previously had after a reaction to sulfa and had almost passed out.  I told a staff person who had me talk to one of the nurses &amp; put me in a separate space from people getting vaccinated.  The nurses then wasted a lot of time talking to me about anxiety instead of treating me.  The cold sensation traveled from my head down my neck, there was a sharp pain in my left breast, and then my heart started racing.  My lips and tongue on the left side started swelling.  I told the nurses this but they ignored me.  Eventually they brought in equipment to monitor my vital signs.  My blood pressure  and heart rate were higher than I had ever seen them and kept rising.  The head nurse eventually said I needed medical care &amp; there was no doctor on site.  She called the paramedics.  It was now 1 hour after I told them something was wrong.  The paramedics thought this was temporary because my bp fell to 153 [I told them I did not have a hist of bp this high]  from where it had been before &amp;   gave me Benadryl pills. (The ER doctor later said they should have done something).  Later that night my HR went up to 220 and I was taken to the ER.  The ER doctor also wasted time assuming it was anxiety but bloodwork showed I was in shock.  They first treated me with 4 aspirin, then Atavan, which all did nothing.  My bp was up to 189 the last time I could view the monitor.  Sodium chloride ivs, Bendaryl ivs were given after the bloodwork.  Diltiazem was eventually also given. I had palpitations that caused my entire body to shake. EKG showed I had developed an atrial flutter and the doctor said the flutter, arrhythmia, and tachycardia were caused by the shock from the vaccine disrupting the electrical signals in my heart.  I stayed overnight in the ER until Sat morning.  I took Diltiazem but jolting palpitations and tremors did not stop.  I saw a cardiologist on the 25th who concluded I had gone into shock from the vaccine, and I was given the wrong medication, and put me on metropolol.  Metoprolol lowered my bp and reduced the palpations.  I weaned off it with the doctor&#39;s permission.  I still have palpitations.

Then I began to have difficulty swallowing my saliva. And then the lump inside my throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time Dr  had already injected me with Epipen and the pharmacist injected me with Solumedrol and I still felt as if I was having difficulty breathing and then I was taken to  ER and I really can&#39;t remember too much after that. I was very groggy and then I was discharged from  ED about 9:30 pm.

                                                tongue swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This 47-years-old female nurse reported that she received BNT162B2 (lot EL0140) 1st dose intramuscular at Left Deltoid on 28Dec2020 9:38 for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history was none. Concomitant drug was not provided. The patient reported in the evening on 28Dec2020, she noticed her tongue swelling. She started to notice her tongue swelling shortly after dinner, probably around 6:30-7 in the evening. She was a little bit on pins and needles regarding this reaction. It happened quite a few hours later after receiving the vaccine. She was thinking should she go to urgent care or emergency room or not. Her tongue was still swollen but it seemed like over the week, the swelling had gotten better. However, the swelling came back. So really overall, the swelling hasn&#39;t gotten much better. She hasn&#39;t been drooling due to the swelling. She hasn&#39;t had issues with eating, drinking, swallowing or breathing. She just had ridges around her tongue. Her tongue felt a little bit heavy. The question she had was how long was this going to take before the swelling went away and was it safe her to take the booster shot (second vaccine)? The swelling was still persisting.  The outcome of the event was not resolved.

                                                About 36 hours after vaccination, I experienced incredible &#34;brain&#34; fatigue/fog. My physical body did not seem affected by the fatigue but my brain/head felt very &#34;fuzzy&#34;. I had a hard time getting words out. Similar feeling to etoh intoxication. I was a bit off balance and dizzy. I remember shaking my head to try to clear it. I also had a very&#34;plastic&#34; taste in my mouth and felt nauseous. At the 48 hour mark (almost exactly) I felt better. At 60 hour mark brain/head symptoms completely resolved. Only experienced a very slight nauseated feeling.

Within 2-3 minutes mouth, tongue and throat started to swell. 50 mg of Benadryl was given. Started to feel better but 45 minutes later swelling started back up. Dryness in mouth still there and water couldn?t quench my thirst. Escorted to Emergency department. Epinephrine shot given 40mg of prednisone, 20 mg of Pepcid and 10 mg of Zyrtec given. Given another 20mg of prednisone, 10 mg of Pepcid and 10 mg of Zyrtec 1.5 hours later. Release after 4.5 hours. Given 3 days of medicine previously given. Swelling started back up 6 hours later so I took 50 mg of Benadryl. Swelling continued every 6-8 hours. Mouth was still really dry but as long as I drank 100 oz of water a day I was ok.   Tuesday I had a small fever and very achy. Went to doctor and he prescribed 20 mg of prednisone twice daily tapering off for 11 days, 10 mg of Pepcid and Zyrtec twice daily for 11 more days.  Finished my medicine Saturday January 2nd. I have been feeling better but still have swelling occasionally.

This lasted for about 20-25 minutes and then  mostly resolved.  I was monitored by the paramedics.  I had normal vitals at the time of evaluation which was soon after notifying staff. After the 1st injection I had a similar episode, but I thought it was anxiety related.

                                                ball palsy, facial dropping; painful shingles; This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reported for herself. A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number: EK5730; dosage form: injection) via an unspecified route of administration as injection to left arm on 24Dec2020 at 7:30 am at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history and concurrent conditions included slight hypertension from Jul2020 and ongoing. Concomitant medications included lisinopril from Jul2020 and ongoing for slight hypertension. The patient developed ball palsy, facial dropping which did not lasted long but she still had the painful shingles on 27Dec2020, after the first dose. She wanted to know the recommendations for taking the second dose which is due in 10 days. The patient wanted to know if she should receive the shingles vaccine. This caller was a lab tech who works in the healthcare industry and manages a medical office; but clarified she did not call on behalf of a healthcare professional. She was the patient who received her first dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine on 24Dec2020. She reported onset of what the Urgent Care Physician believed was Shingles on 27Dec2020. She called to ask if she should or should not receive the second dose of Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine on 14Jan2021 as scheduled due to the Shingles. The Urgent Care Physician advised her to still get the second dose, as there was about a 1:10,000 chance of developing shingles with the vaccine. She reported shingles as a reaction subsequent to the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine. Initially on 27Dec2020 she developed sites of what she thought were canker sores or fever blisters in her mouth which had gotten pretty large and stopped her from being able to eat on 29Dec2020. Then on 30Dec2020 she developed sites on her face which have gotten scarily large; and was causing some deep nerve pain going to her eye and down her chin; the sites felt like lesions on her face with roots. The sites in her mouth were now completely gone; but the sites on her face are ongoing. Now it has kind of taken over her face. She saw the Urgent Care Physician regarding this who believed the sites to be shingles. She had never had fever blisters or shingles before this event. She was still kind of reeling. The report was reported as non-serious. The outcome of event ball palsy/facial dropping was resolved and of shingles was unknown.

On 08Jan2021, about 5-10 minutes after the second dose, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness, reported as life-threatening. She reported that these events occurred within less than 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine. She went to the emergency room and was treated with methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL), famotidine (PEPCID), and epinephrine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). She was sent home and prescribed methylprednisolone and epinephrine (EPI-PEN).  Later on 08Jan2021, she experienced dizziness and headache, which were consistent. She stated she would most likely take ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as treatment (not specified if taken). The clinical outcomes of the flushed, diaphoretic, redness and rash, hives on chest, tachycardia, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were recovered on 08Jan2021; while the outcomes of the dizziness and headache were not recovered and that of the anaphylaxis was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported information is limited. Based on the close temporal relationship and the description of the events, there is a reasonable possibility that the events are related to BNT162 vaccine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

By midafternoon, the nausea and stomach pains subsided, all other symptoms remained along with then getting a 100.5 fever. I was taking Tylenol every 4 hours since 1am and keeping hydrated. By midnight I was exhausted and was finally able to sleep. I woke the following morning with a dull headache and just felt achy. I felt much better by that evening (now Monday). Tuesday morning I woke with discomfort to my left armpit and clavicle area. I then noticed swelling, the areas felt ?lumpy? and were very tender to touch. That lasted about 2 days.

After the third day, symptoms subsided and I was back to normal activity. On the 7th day following the vaccine, I began having pain in the armpit of the left side. It was painful to have pressure on the area and to raise the arm overhead. It progressed on the the 8th day with increased pain and tenderness to touch. On the 9th day, I had severe pain with palpation and could feel a lump in the armpit. I have no redness, heat, or rash in the area. I went to my physician with concern because I have had a double mastectomy two years ago.

A 47-year-old female patient received the first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL0140), intramuscular in left arm on 20Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination was administered in a hospital. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Medical history included hypertension, overweight, and known allergies to bee stings and hair dye. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included multivitamins. On 20Dec2020, within 15 minutes, the patient began feeling dry throat, then itching, then it felt like she had a lump inside her throat. Then she began to have difficulty swallowing her saliva. And then the lump inside her throat started to feel larger and larger. By this time, the doctor had already injected the patient with Epipen and the pharmacist injected her with Solumedrol and she still felt as if she was having difficulty breathing and then she was taken to ER and she really can&#39;t remember too much after that. The patient was very groggy and then was discharged from ED about 9:30 pm. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unknown date. Treatment for the events included epinephrine, methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of feeling dry throat, itching, felt like having lump inside her throat, having difficulty swallowing saliva, difficulty breathing and very groggy cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  Severe allergic reaction is the known risk for the product. The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I was vaccinated at 3:30pm .  At 5:27pm while driving home i felt a cold sensation in the back of my neck and back of my throat which began spreading to the back of my head . My heart felt as if I was startled by something.  I looked at my smart watch and my heart rate was 145.  I began trembling and having abdominal cramping . The back of my head felt like I had swelling or collection of fluid.  I opened my windows and began taking slow deep breaths to bring down my heart rate . It took quite a while to get it below 100. I felt as if I was going to pass out.  After deep breathing for what felt like atleasr 15 to 20 minutes , my pulse came down and I closed my windows . As soon as my body warmed back up in the car , the symptoms returned and my heart rate went back up to 130s , 140s . I had to keep my windows down and deep breathe the entire way home which took an hour . My body was trembling.  When I got home I felt as if I was too week to get out of the car . I still felt that startled feeling in my heart and was afraid of what could happen next . My lips and face were swollen.  My lips were also slightly itchy. I called 911 for help . By the time they arrived my vital signs had stabilized but I still had swelling in my face and lips . My EKG , vital signs and oxygen levels checked out normal so I did not go to the ER. That night I took benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 2 post vaccine the collection of fluid or swelling in the back of my head had now spread to the top . That night I had the feeling that my throat was swelling do I took benadryl and Tylenol and my face and lips were still slightly swollen . Day 3 post vaccine I woke up with slightly blurry vision. The swelling in my head now feels like it has encompassed my entire head and have a slight headache.  I went to the urgent care requesting an MRI of the head and an epi pen . I was given Medrol dose pack , an RX for epi pen for emergencies and advised to continue benadryl and Tylenol.  Day 4 post vaccine,  slight headache continues. Slightly blurry vision

A 47-years-old female patient received first dose bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in Left arm, via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Sinus infection, Kidney stones, pink eye when she was a kid. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. She reports the following side effects: itchy, red and swollen eyes, itchy throat, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip). The patient experienced Right eye itching, red and swollen eyes/right eye swollen, Right eye pink on 08Jan2021 with outcome recovering, right eye shut on 09Jan2021 with outcome of received on 09Jan2021, itching throat, mucus from throat, clear mucus, Right eye weeping on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered/resolved with sequel on 11Jan2021, Left eye itching on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021, runny nose, clear mucous (post nasal drip) on 08Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 11Jan2021, right eye red/ right Eye being Red on 09Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 09Jan2021. The patient got her First shot on Thursday morning at 7:30AM, then on Friday night 08Jan2021 at 7 in the evening her right eye was itching and weeping, it felt like something was in the eye but there wasn&#39;t. The right eye was swelling as well on Friday. On Friday the itching of the throat started.  She is also having scratchiness in the throat. Her eye is scratchy also. When she woke up Saturday 09Jan2021 she couldn&#39;t open the right eye, it was glued shut completely and red. When she was a kid, in the past she has had pink eye, and there was green stuff coming out the eye but this was not like previously. She had to pull the eye lids apart, maybe this is viral.  With her throat, she has had sinus infection in the past before in which she couldn&#39;t breath out of the nose, but with this she is experiencing Mucus that is clear and thin from the throat. Her left eye itching started Friday night, but it was only slight itchiness and by Saturday the left eye was normal. She is purely doing this report to help, in case other people have this happen. Early today, she did use a Neti pot and it did help a little, she has had horrible sinus infections in the past but this is not it. In the past, once you get a sinus infection you are prone to getting them, thankfully she has not had one in a few years, she would get thick crap in the sinuses, in this case her eye was draining going into her nose, therefore making her have a runny nose, and she also had scratching in the throat. She is breathing clearly through the nose. Itching in the right eye was ongoing but less intense. Right Eye Swollen: She was looking at mirror hates looking at herself but the eyelid was back to normal, however the white part of eye is still swollen. Right eye being Shut: It is open now, that was a one day occurrence. Itching in the throat: She noticed that today at noon around 1 is when she last had it, it is 5% still there where she feels something. Mucus from Throat: She used the Neti pot a couple hours ago, at about 1:30 PM. Since then she has had some drainage but it is 95% better. Her Right Eye ball is still pink looking like as if she was hung over. The Left eyeball is white. Right Eye Weeping: She left work because her right eye was weeping so much, going into her nose, and she is running at work, she has glasses, goggles, face shield, and so she cant wipe the liquid. She came home and iced her eye which helped. Right Eye Pink: On Saturday the right eye was red. Right now it is pink, like an eye lash is in the eye. The right Eye being Red was only for Saturday, like sclerosis, it was red and swollen. The left eye was swollen, but it is better now from this morning. She was super congested on Friday (08Jan2021), barely being able to sleep, she couldn&#39;t breathe through the nose. Weird, she barely slept but it wasn&#39;t a sinus infection. She couldn&#39;t sleep because of nose running and the eye running then Saturday into Sunday she was able to sleep with eye running. The runny nose got better with the neti pot. She is schedule for the 2nd dose on 28Jan2021. The outcome of other events was unknown. Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

It just kind of stayed the same size and it remained there for whole three weeks.  This small one along my collar bone that started right after the first vaccine and that has stayed the whole time. But got bigger after my second.&#34;  No treatment was received. The outcome of event was not resolved. The patient believed the swollen lymph nodes were due to the Covid 19 Vaccine.

A 47-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), Lot Number EL3249, via an unspecified route of administration from 25Jan2021 14:00 (at the age of 47 years old), Dose 2, as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included she had her tonsils out on an unknown date. She was a nurse that works with COVID patients; she got tested twice last week (Jan2021), both were negative. She had no pre-existing medical conditions. She has never had a problem with vaccines. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously received dose 1 of BNT162B2 on 04Jan2021 (Lot # EX9231) and experienced no reaction then. The patient had the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine around 2 PM yesterday (25Jan2021) and she kept moving around in bed and feeling sick last night. That night she was just tired and achy but she thought that could just be from working. She went to bed early and she woke up around 1:50 or 2 AM with chills so she went and got a thermometer. She woke up at about 2 AM (26Jan2021) with a 103 fever and chills and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and her face felt swollen, but her right carotid hurt. Her skin just burns; she went to take a shower. With the skin burning she knew it was sore to touch but when she got in the shower, that was when she noticed it hurt. She was really achy; her legs were aching and she was having shooting pains in different spots. She commented that she called out today (26Jan2021), she never calls out; all she wanted to do was take a shower and she wondered if she needed to go to the doctor. Her skin burns even when she was showering; every part her skin burns. She was also having muscle and joint pain and cough and the back of her ribs hurt (Jan2021). The other thing was nausea (Jan2021).  The fever and chills were persisting and were about the same. She was hoping for it to go down so she could go to work to tomorrow (27Jan2021). The clinical outcome of the fever, chills, and her right carotid on her neck felt swollen and hurt was not recovered.   The clinical outcome of feeling sick, tired and achy, face feels swollen, skin burning, muscle and joint pain, cough, back of her ribs hurt, nausea, and shooting pains in different spots was unknown. The reporter states she thinks what she is reporting was directly related to the product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of the reported events cannot be excluded.

A minute later fatigue hit and I was starting to fall asleep at the wheel. I live 1 mile away so I made it home. Now my head was getting fuzzy.  Called a co-worker to tell her what was happening and she said my speech was slurring. I felt drunk and hungover at the same time.  I went to bed and slept for an hour. I woke up and felt very fatigued. I  finally went to bed for the night then was awoken with severe arm pain. My entire upper arm felt so tight but I it was soft upon palpation. I fell asleep and awoke to terrible arm pain again. I started crying in bed but fell asleep again. I woke up in the morning with severe upper arm pain and minor headache. I couldn&#39;t rotate my arm back to put my bra on so I took some ibuprofen. That had immediate relief for my arm and headache. I ran one errand and was wiped out. The fatigue hit again.  The arm pain came back so I took another ibuprofen with relief. I had no energy so laid around for the rest of the day. I woke up on Sunday and finally felt normal with  just pain at the injection site.  The 2 other medical people that have had similar reactions like mine with dizziness and feeling light-headed have one thing in common with me...we are all vegetarians. I don&#39;t know if that makes a difference with protein metabolism or other enzymatic activity, but we are the only 3 that I know of out of all of our co-workers who have received the vaccine to react like this.

                                                I was diagnosed with shingles on my left side on 12/31/2020, with symptoms (burning/skin sensitivity on my back (probably on 12/27, definitely by 12/28 progressing to waves of pain in my back to abdomen).  On 12/30, a rash appeared on my abdomen starting below my navel and going around my left side to about an inch before my spine.   I submitted a picture and it was diagnosed as shingles via a virtual visit.  It is  responding to antiviral therapy, although I still have a rash and pain (but improving). I did not go through the COVID vaccine side effect virtual visit route because I did not really think it was a side effect and knew I had a history of chicken pox and have been experiencing ongoing stress.  The provider for the virtual visit told me to still report it for it to be investigated, but she too, thought it was likely unrelated, but still should be investigated.

A 48-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) Lot #EH9899, via an unspecified route of administration on 16Dec2020 at single dose by injection in the right deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included borderline hypertension from 2018 and ongoing.  Concomitant medication included olmesartan medoxomil (BENICAR) from 2018 and ongoing for borderline hypertension. The nurse reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine last 16Dec2020 but tested positive via Nasal Swab test on 24Dec2020. She said this kinda weird. She received the COVID vaccine on 16Dec2020. She tested positive for COVID on 24Dec2020. Obviously she was exposed to COVID prior to the vaccine. She was scheduled to have the 2nd dose on 05Jan2021 but her hospital deferred it to 23Mar2021. She was asking if this was what&#39;s recommended.She said this was another weird thing, regarding the weight last week she was 167 and this week she was 180 (in Dec2020). She was very bloated in Dec2020, it was bizarre. He husband did not receive the vaccine and had symptoms on 24Dec2020. She had normal seasonal allergy symptoms. She did not think much of it. She took her Xyzal and her normal things.She took her husband to get tested and he tested positive, so she got tested, and was positive. She worked at (address withheld), and all of her patients were immunocompromised. She was shocked. She did not think this had anything to do with the vaccine. If anything, it has helped her fight the virus.By Christmas day 25Dec2020 her fever was 102, she had body aches, she went into overdrive. She had headaches and lots of gas in Dec2020.She went into overdrive from partial recognition from the vaccine.She was very very weak, almost lethargic. Her O2 saturation have stayed good around 98% in Dec2020. She has done really well. Yesterday or the day before she felt really bad again. She did a virtual visit with (name withheld), and the doctor started her on steroids and gave her an inhaler just in case she needed it. She felt better on 30De2020. On 29De2020 she was so bad and bloated, she only had one dose of the steroids, but had unusual weight gain. Then 2 pounds were gone this morning on 30De2020.She had no pitting edema or edema period. She was very fatigued, but had more energy this morning, probably because of the steroids. She had the vaccine, even though day 7 post-injection, instead of day 10, which was about 50%, her body reacted more so than her husbands because her body recognized it. The outcome of the events was unknown. She was unsure of the outcome. It was up and down. She has felt worse and she has felt better. The reporter considered the event Tested positive for COVID was Not serious and unrelated to the BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: While reporter causality is noted, a possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; neuropathy in fingers, toes, roof of mouth/lips; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). This 48-year-old female patient (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot#: EL0140) at single dose on left arm on 30Dec2020 at 09:00 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma (controlled); hypertension diagnosis 1 year ago; allergies to medications, food and environmental. Concomitant medications in two weeks included antihypertensives - amlodipine and losartan. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine.

On 30Dec2020 at 9:15 AM, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction within 10 minutes of administration, neuropathy in fingers, toes, roof of mouth/lips. Neuropathy continued to date. The adverse events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient received treatment Epinephrine IM (intramuscular) and IV (intravenous) steroids. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of anaphylactic reaction and neuropathy peripheral due to temporal relationship.

                                                Initial event was soreness at site which resolved on its own within a few days.  2 days after receiving vaccine, I began having an allergy reaction  to the same brand N95 that I had been utilizing since the beginning of the pandemic. Symptoms are swollen cheeks and welts , sudden itchiness at the site of my mask placement. The reason for this report is a sudden onset of excruciating and debilitating pain throughout my body specifically pain of my right shoulder radiating down my sprightly arm. I have been receiving testing and treatment for ongoing neuropathy due to Longhauler syndrome, however This recent pain is so debilitating, I spend most of my time in bed.  I have been experiencing chills then profuse sweating.  I also so fatigued, I sleep much of the day.  I have been having episodes of tachycardia with chest tightness which has increased since after having the vaccine. I also become short winded on exertion. I?ve been waking up in a panic and sweating.

                                                After vaccination, patient was ok, talking and eating.  Suddenly, patient complains of dizziness, and &#34;didn&#39;t feel right&#34;.  Patient was laid flat on a couch, but then passed out and was not responsive to sternal rub.  After a code was called, the patient woke up.  At no time was there a loss of pulse or SOB.  Patient was transported to the ER and was subsequently discharged same day.  Patient did report that prior to the vaccination, she ran 13 miles in the morning, which may have had something to do with the reaction.

                                                I waited 15 minutes and was fine. As I was driving to my work, my injection site began to hurt severely and I felt my throat swelling, it became increasingly difficult to swallow. My tongue felt larger and my lips and face began to feel numb. I felt flushed and I became tachycardic. It lasted about 45 seconds and then waned and then would flare again.  I was able to speak and called my husband (a physician) who stayed on the phone with me while I drove to the hospital. I went straight to an outpatient unit and was given hydrocortisone IV, loratidine PO and famotidine. By the time I was on the unit, my throat only felt slightly tight with tachycardia down to 103. Following the injection of steroids, I only had one further flare of throat tightness and tachycardia that was transient lasting 30-40 seconds. Everything resolved within 40 minutes of receiving therapy. Of note, I apparently had erythema on the anterior of my neck which corresponded to the area of throat tightness.

I then  got in my car and I felt little bit sick and I picked up food and I started to feel sick. I went to work and my symptoms got worse and I sat in my desk and I felt like fainting.  I just felt so sick and I thought it was my diabetes.  A coworker saw me and told me i looked deathly pale and felt fainting and they took me to a ER room. They gave me Benadryl and IV fluids. I started seeing the floor and ceiling warped out, I was hallucinating.   My legs felt numb as well.  My eyes were twitching constantly. My blood pressure 147/95 and pulse was 112.   I went home, ate and went to sleep. On Saturday I felt better and went back to work 12-28-2020,  I  felt weak and stayed working at my shift. On Tuesday I worked 1  hour and still felt super weak.  Today I am starting to feel like myself again.  I will not get my second dosage due to my symptoms I have experienced.

She tried applying ice on the most red part on the arm but the swelling continued to grow. Then she started applying heat in addition to applying HPR&#43; cream that she uses for urticaria. The only thing that the patient stated that helped a little was the ice pack. The patient ended up going to the emergency department on 1/14/2020 for the rash / welt that developed beyond her arm and to the neck and eyelid area which she described as itchy. The patient was prescribed a 4 day prednisone 50mg daily course along with Benadryl as needed and Pepcid 40mg daily which she states have helped alleviate the itchiness but has not completely resolved yet as of today 1/15/2020.   Per ED note, patient presented with mild erythema around the injection site and non-specific rash to the neck. Patient has clear speech and no oral swelling and no signs of anaphylaxis. Patient discharged home in stable condition and advised to follow up with primary care doctor in 2-3 days.

I went home and took a shower and noticed that my L armpit was swollen, like the size of a tennis ball! No redness, no fevers but sore and discomforting due to the swelling.

                                                positive for Covid; positive for Covid; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient).  A 48-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in right deltoid, on 18Dec2020 07:15 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing hypothyroidism and hysterectomy. Concomitant medications included estradiol (taking after hysterectomy) and levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, both ongoing. The patient has no any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient stated that she received the Covid vaccine mid- Dec2020. She stated she was supposed to receive the 2nd dose 2 days ago, 06Jan2021. On 03Jan2021, she started feeling bad the day before testing positive, went to urgent care to be tested, thought she had the flu.  She tested positive for Covid on Monday 04Jan2021, so she has been in quarantine. She was unable to receive her 2nd dose because she was in quarantine. She wanted to know if it&#39;s ok to delay the second dose or if she needs to re-start the series. The reporter assessed the event relatedness was unknown, patient stated that she doesn&#39;t know the causality, she has not been in contact with anyone that was known to be positive, but she is a healthcare worker who sees multiple patients a day, so one of them could have been asymptomatic. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The information currently provided is too limited to make a meaningful medical assessment hence, the events are conservatively assessed as related to the suspect drug BNT162B2 until further information becomes available.

                                                At approximately hour 40 post vaccine my Axillary lymph node became very enlarged, painful and hard.  It was causing a tingling in my arm, like a pinched nerve and was painful to keep my arm in a relaxed position.  The node was visible if I lifted my arm above my head.  With a dose of ibuprofen, the swelling reduced but it was still palpable and painful for the next 18 hours.  By the 72 hour vaccine mark, all symptoms were gone.

                                                I had a full body sensation of being hot, a little dizzy, not well, I figured it was waiting in a large room that was busy with my mask, jacket and glasses on, I calmed down but did not feel well. I walked to my car, my fingers were a little tingly, then when I took my mask off the left side of my face was swelling, tingly, red (I have rosacea- but this was different) I did not panic, but I knew something was wrong. I decided to drive to the hospital instead of driving home, the valet said my face was swelling. I went to the ER - was given Pepic and Benadryl via an IV - I was there for observation - as I was waiting for my medication, I began to feel itchy at the base of my neck and on my chest

Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant drugs included lisinopril for blood pressure/hypertension, omeprazole and vitamin supplements. Historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot# EK5730) on 21Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization and having a swollen lymph node along her collar bone on the left side which was on the side where she got the shot and it didn&#39;t really change much, it just kind of stayed the same size and it remained there for whole three weeks.

Nurse further stated she also had some intermittent fatigue that she expected and also off and on feelings of like disconnection or feelings of like of being drunk. But that&#39;s not very bothersome, that&#39;s just once in a while since 11Jan2021. But she was concerned about the swelling of lymph nodes. No treatment was received for events. Outcome of events was not recovered. Nurse believed that swollen lymph nodes, fatigue and feeling drunk were due to the Covid 19 Vaccine.

Tonight around 7:00 pm I am still experiencing some numbness and tingling on my face and lip which comes and goes. I am having soreness in my arm at the injection site.

My throat developed allergy reaction feeling, same reaction I get with nuts.  Throat did not swell and benedryl managed the reaction on Jan 3rd.  My eyes began swelling and I could not stop sneezing.  Developed laryngitis from the post nasal drainage.   I was up whole night but still went into work as normal on Jan 4th.  Struggled through the days but swelling and itching subsided.    I experienced the muscle aches on the 3rd and 4th. On Jan 5th, started feeling better and rested.  Still have reddened reaction on arm but is fading.  It is faintly visible today on Jan 6th, I feel better, just have the sneezing currently and a mild headache.  Benedryl is the only medication besides daily meds I took during the past several days.  I did not want to interrupt the immune system&#39;s work.

                                                I did let the nurse know right after I got the vaccine It did feel like  a huge water balloon was sitting on my arm and very heavy at the site. I went to the waiting area and the last 5 minutes and I started feeling weird, kind of getting dizzy and my heart started racing really fast. Am I can tell I was getting really hot and my face was flushed and my heart was racing and my hands started shaking, trembling almost like I couldn&#39;t control it. I&#39;ve never experienced something like this. The part that really scared me was my heart racing like it was going to come out of my chest. They called a code, put me in a wheel chair and took me to the ER (where I work).  They took my blood pressure which was really high, they did EKG, blood work and urine test. They kept me there for about five hours, while watching me. And the last weird thing that happened at one point I felt like liquid was running thru my body and my feet were really cold for several hours, It felt like someone was pouring liquid over me. I kept asking the nurse if this is normal and no one knew what to tell me.  After everything started slowing back down and it had been a couple hours and the next day i felt like I had a slight head ache and felt out of it, kind of  like I had a hangover and of course my arm was really sore.  The Doctor in the ER did advise me not to get the second dose as it will be worse than the first one.

                                                EE received vaccine, waited in room for about 20 minutes. About 10 minutes after receiving vaccine, she felt warm but she had a coat on and her eyes started to hurt and she felt tired but she works night shift.  She felt this was normal for working the night before and having stayed up to get the vaccine.  After her wait period she went to her car and remembers feeling warm for having to walk in the cold.  Her right side of face became reddish purple and warm.  She sat in car for a few minutes.  As she drove her face started to swell and turn all red.  When she arrived home she had heavy pressure middle of face-nose area.  Her face continued to turn reddish purple with a rash on right side of face and down to her neck.  She felt her sinuses and throat swell with irritation and in throat and wheezing.  Her mom is a nurse and they waited to see if it worsen or got better.  She decided since she could breath she would not go to hospital. After about 5 hours she felt much better.  She continued to have a headache for 4 days.  She had swelling and soreness of left arm for a couple of days.  She continued to go to work.

                                                I woke up the following morning with pain and inflammation in RT armpit.. by midday the swelling in armpit lymph nodes was the size of a very large egg.  I couldn&#39;t comfortably put my arm down at my side.  Pain radiated down arm to elbow, and up neck into ears.  I had fever of 100.1, but took ibuprofen to try and alleviate pain.  The symptoms lasted about 5 days.

I had malaise and fatigue.  I took some cold medicine 3 times in the course of 24 hours and woke up the next morning with none of those symptoms but did have lympadenopathy under my left arm that decreased through the course of the day.  It was painful to touch and tender once the lymph node decreased in size.  The only other reaction was the site pain and tenderness and warmth.  That lasted a few days.

A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EH9899 and expiration date not provided), intramuscular in the left arm on 06Jan2021 16:00 (at the age of 49 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included psoriasis, microscopic colitis, allergies to shellfish, and coconut. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took estrogen patch, etanercept (ENBREL) and sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced allergies to all. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and did not take any other medications with 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. On 06Jan2021 16:15, the patient experienced a very warm flush feeling, nausea started and by 15 minutes, she had swelling of the throat and rash on her arms and abdomen and the palms of her hands were bright red. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care visit. The patient was treated with diphenhydramine hcl (BENADRYL), steroids (unspecified), famotidine (PEPCID) and ondansetron (ZOFRAN) in response to the events. The patient assessed the events as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered with sequel on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The patient has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                &#34;I received the Pfizer Covid vaccine Wed afternoon around 4pm. Thursday morning around 9:30 I started with severe pain in my left leg. The pain worsened through the day and my leg began swelling. No other symptoms at all. This morning my leg was twice the size of my right leg so I went to the ER. I live in so I&#39;m at ED. I have a massive blood clot running the the length of my leg - from my thigh to my ankle. I&#39;m very lucky I got here so fast! I?m a very healthy 49 year old with no history of DVT or blood clots so they dug further to find out why. A cat scan showed I have a congenital condition called May Thurner Syndrome. I?m so relieved to have an answer and it?s fixable! The vascular doctors are not 100% convinced that?s not all that was going on as I was born with the syndrome and I?ve gone this long without a clot. So they are doing lots of labs to see if anything else shows up. This is where we are at. I?m being admitted to take care of the clot.&#34;

                                                29 minutes after vaccine was given i felt tingling and numbness on my left cheek and left side of my lips. i informed nurse and she began taking blood pressure and oxygen levels while asking if i was breathing ok.  i said yes. i then felt the right side of my lips go numb.  i felt a faint tightness in my throat but after about two minutes it felt like my right side of the lips started to feel normal and my throat.  then all at once i felt the blood rush from my body and tingling all over. i told the nurse i didnt feel good. she layed me down on the floor and put my feet up. she asked what i was feeling and i said i felt like i was going to faint.  i was aware that my tongue felt heavy and i wasn&#39;t talking clear. another nurse got the allergist or doctor on standby and she asked me what i was feeling. i just rubbed my throat and my cheeks and lips and felt numbness and my throat tight and my tongue very thick. she asked if i was having a hard time swallowing. i nodded so she said they were going to sit me up because they needed to give me an Epipen. i nodded, tgey brought a wheekchair for me and as they helped me stand because i had no strength, a nurse stabbed me with the Epipen then they took me to the emergency room and observed me until 2:30pmish to make sure i didnt have another episode. then i wss discharged and was told to follow up with my primary care doctor within 3 days. An  allergist will also see me to do a skin test.

On 20Dec2020 11:45, the patient had blood pressure high, 218/116 mmHg.  Based on information available, the reported high blood pressure was probably causally related to the first dose of BNT162B2, considering the plausible temporal relationship, and clinical course.  However, the concomitant medications, especially prednisone, for unspecified indications, could be confounding factors.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 49-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration at arm on 15Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Nurse stated that she just wanted to report what she thinks is adverse reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer not sure what to do about it at this point. She was vaccinated Friday 11 o&#39;clock in the afternoon. Both days felt really fine. Last night (16Jan2021) got some fullness under her armpit which was on the same side as the vaccine, which looked like swollen lymph nodes under her armpit which you can see was kind of benign. But in addition to that some generalized malaise lowgrade and headache (Jan2021). Seems totally fine but her both eyes are very swollen (Jan2021). Nurse took some ibuprofen (ADVIL)-600 mg, she was taking Prednisone for inflammatory prosthesis in her eye as treatment (Jan2021). Outcome of the events was unknown.   The nurse considered the occurrence of the events are because of COVID-19 Vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Swollen eyes and Eye inflammation cannot be excluded.

This 49-year-old female nurse reported for herself that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Lot number: EL8982) at single dose for Vaccination on 14Jan2021. The vaccine was injected to left deltoid/shoulder about 2:15 pm. Relevant medical history included ongoing uterine fibroids since Dec2019, ongoing obesity since Oct2000 and COVID-19 from Dec2020 to Dec2020.   Relevant concomitant drug was unknown. The patient had surgical procedures when she had her first child. No Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s).  Her mother got the shot a couple of days before caller did and she had no problems. The patient was administered her first dose of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 14Jan2021. She reported that she became sick (Medically significant) about 12 hours later on 15Jan2021.  The patient Went to sleep and woke up about 12 hours after she got the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with a body temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and arm pain. She could not really go back to sleep. When she got up it went away. She tried to go to work that day, and did go to work but she was really tired. When she finally got home she got in the bed and really had not been out of bed since then except for today she was sitting in a chair; so she thought maybe she had improved a little bit at on the reporting day. She had maintained a constant fever since 15Jan2021 that had gotten as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit. At the reporting time her temp was 100.5. She had alternated Tylenol and Motrin for the fever. She was sweating profusely so it may be the temperature trying to break, but she had been struggling since she had it. This was so unlike her, she did not just stay in bed. She could not kick it. She had been unable to work since 15Jan2021 and she had to work tomorrow.  She believed this was medically significant because she cannot work.  The patient did not have vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine(s).  No Additional Vaccines was administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect. Relevant Tests was None. The patient did not visit the emergency Room nor Physician Office due to the events. The outcome of event being sick was resolving. The outcome of event temperature had gotten as high as 103 degrees Fahrenheit was not resolved. The outcome of other events was unknown. The patient thought the causality was yes 100% because her COVID-19 symptoms were not even this bad; she never had a fever with COVID-19; and she had never before had a fever this high for this long.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible chronological association between vaccine administration and onset of the event; causality therefore cannot be excluded.

                                                About 3am the next morning I woke up to a loud ringing in both my ear.  When I sat up I was very very dizzy.  I got up and showered and my feet swelled very bad.  I did not feel well but I went to work but the feelings never got better.  So on 1/10 Sunday I went to the medical center because I jjust didnt not feel well.  The swelling in the lower legs was still there so I was prescribed 20 mg of presnisone for 5 days.  The sound changed during the time of the antibotics but after I stopped taking the prednisone the ringing sound came back, my left foot is still numb and my eyes are constantly red and burning even after putting drops in my eyes, I still suffer from headaches and if I turn my head too far left or right I get dizzy still to date.  On 1/14 I was given a 60 mg dose of tapered predinosone for 2 week to help elevate the symptoms but it did not work.  On 2/12 I saw an ENT specialist who performed a hearing test which did produce minor hearing loss and was diagnosed with having Tinnitis.

I was driving home and did become itchy and developed a couple of small hives that quickly went away.  The main event that I am reporting is a severe outbreak of eczema. I used to get it on my hands as a child and it was caused by citrus. On the morning of 12/24, I noticed itching and a red rash starting on my right wrist and my left hand. I thought perhaps it was from over washing or not rinsing all of the soap off. The rash became worse and I noticed a small area above my lip on the left side, I then developed a large area on the right side of my lower face. There were also a few spots elsewhere but these were the worst.

At approximately 9pm I began to experience whole body chills, teeth chattering, and extreme fatigue. I took Ibuprofen and went to sleep. I experienced chills until approx 3 AM. My watch alerted my heart rate rose above 120 bpm three separate times during the night in the 1, 2 and 3:00 hours. Upon review of the summary it appears to have been sustained at just over 120 for that entire time. I awoke at noon, with a temp of approx 99.5 F, I felt extreme fatigue and a sense of cold but body was warm to touch and I was very sweaty this entire time. I slept most of the day and at 5 pm awoke with a temp of 102.4F. I contacted my physician who directed me to use tylenol and Benadryl. I took a dose at 5 pm, anther at 9 PM. Upon waking the next morning I was afebrile. At that time I felt slightly dizzy and lightheaded but also dehydrated. Forcing fluids relieved symptoms.

                                                Approximately 2 hours post injection, my  left arm started to feel warm and itchy. I was wearing a thick hoodie and when I pulled  my sleeve up, it was covered with hives and welts. My lower lip started to feel full and nose started to feel runny. I was close to a pharmacy when I discovered the hives so I went and bought Tylenol and Benadryl and took it immediately. After that, I headed to the emergency room of the facility where I got my covid 19 -Pfizer injection. When I got there, my right arm started to feel itchy as well and I also broke out in a rash on my left upper chest. They gave me a steroid injection and steroid taper prescription.  When I got home that night, my right forearm broke out in hives. The next couple of days, my left arm intermittently had hives.

A 50-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EL1284, expiration date: Apr2021), via an unspecified route of administration at right deltoid on 29Dec2020 17:45 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma from 2003 and ongoing, tachycardia and major surgery. Concomitant medication included maintenance inhaler (unspecified) for asthma. Patient was officially diagnosed with asthma in 2003. She said her asthma was controlled, and she takes a maintenance inhaler every day. She said she has been taking the same maintenance inhaler since she was first diagnosed with the asthma. She said she rarely uses a rescue inhaler. Reported she was prescribed the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg for her tachycardia that she had after her major surgery, but she did not take the full 25mg dose during that time. She said she hasn&#39;t had taken the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg in almost a year, clarifying it was last Jan2020 that she used the Metoprolol Tartrate. The patient previously received a flu shot in Oct2020, and felt rundown for a day afterwards, but that she always does after she receives a flu shot. She said she had no heart issues after receiving the flu shot in Oct2020. The patient who is a registered nurse reported she received the COVID-19 vaccine last night at work, on 29Dec2020, at 5:45PM, and had experienced some tachycardia after receiving the vaccine. Reported the COVID-19 Vaccine was offered through her employer. She said the COVID-19 vaccine was optional and offered to all employees if they work at the hospital. She experienced the tachycardia at 11:00 PM last night, 29Dec2020. She said her normal resting heart rate is between the high 60s to low 70s. She said her heart rate at 11:00PM last night was at around 100, clarifying she was not running a fever at that time. She stated after she received the COVID-19 vaccine, she was not feeling right, so she took the day off from work today, and slept in. She said when she woke up this morning (in Dec2020), she still didn&#39;t feel right, saying she felt weak and wobbly, and when she checked her pulse it was 115. She said she does have a past history of tachycardia. She said a year ago she had major surgery, and she had tachycardia after the major surgery. She said the tachycardia eventually went away, but she did have to see a cardiologist and take a beta blocker. She said she took a tiny dose of the beta blocker this morning, and called the cardiologist to let him know what was going on. She said she has not heard back from the cardiologist yet. She said the tachycardia went away once she took the beta blocker this morning. She said she took the beta blocker because her heart rate was going higher, and higher. She said she didn&#39;t want to end up like last year after her major surgery with a heart rate in the 170s. She said the tachycardia she was experiencing after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine was not normal for her. She said once she got over the major surgery last year, her heart rate was fine. Reported her employer was making employees wait around for 15 minutes after the employees received the COVID-19 Vaccine to make sure no one had a major reaction to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine, she waited around longer than the 15 minutes. She said she felt weird after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and thought maybe she was experiencing anxiety. She said she was lightheaded on 29Dec2020 after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine and completed a report right then on the website. She said the website is for reporting adverse events, and she was sent a website link to complete the adverse event reporting. She said she signed into the website link while she was still at the hospital. She said one of the website&#39;s first questions asked was how she was feeling. She said the question made her wonder if her lightheadedness was due to her heart rate being up because she becomes lightheaded when that happens. She clarified she reported only the lightheadedness on the website, and not the tachycardia. She said her lightheadedness got better and she was fine, and then at 11:00PM the tachycardia hit her like a switch. Reported this morning she felt fine, and then all of sudden she wasn&#39;t fine. Tachycardia Treatment: Reported she took a 8.5mg dose, or one quarter of a 25mg tablet (as provided by the reporter) of the beta blocker Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning and called her cardiologist to let him know. She said she split the Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg tablet this morning, and only took a quarter of the 25mg tablet (reported as a 8.5mg dose by the reporter). Reported she believes 100% that her tachycardia was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine, saying she has been fine up until receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she got the COVID-19 Vaccine because she was afraid of getting the COVID-19 Virus with her asthma. She said she has no other preexisting conditions besides the asthma. Reported she is not going to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said it was scary when her heart rate shot up out of nowhere. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine is the only thing different she has done. She said before the COVID-19 Vaccine, she was completely fine. Patient asked if the Pfizer DSU agent had heard of anyone else who has experienced tachycardia after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. The outcome of the event tachycardia was recovered in Dec2020, event lightheadedness was recovering and unknown for the other events. The reporter assessed the event &#39;tachycardia&#39; as Serious (Medically Significant).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event tachycardia with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded. The medical history of tachycardia and asthma medication may be contributory as well.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                anaphylaxis; throat swelling; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 50-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypertension, lipids (as reported) and asthma. The patient was known allergies: codeine, iodine, shellfish, latex, and cefatrizine propyleneglycolate (CEFTIN). Prior to vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in hospital. The patient experienced anaphylaxis and throat swelling on 22Dec2020 with outcome of recovered in Dec2020.  The events were reported as non-serious. The events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment of epinephrine, steroids, antihistamines, observation was received for the events.    Information on lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis and throat swelling cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of allergies to multiple materials may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

My arm was sore but my armpit was so painful (felt like stabbing sensation).  This lasted until around 2:00 pm Saturday.  I felt ok except for being tired and armpit still hurting quite a bit. On Sunday, I was very tired and slept during the day and went to bed around 8:30 pm feeling like I had a slight sore throat, tired and mildly nauseous. My armpit still hurt quite a bit.  I woke up Monday at 5:30 am and showered and was profusely sweating when I was getting ready for work - my temperature was 100.6 so I took 800 mg of Ibuprofen to help with the temp and the pain in my armpit.  I did not go into work. I  am still tired and my current temp is 100.1 (12:30pm) and sweaty.  I do feel as though the severity of my armpit pain is lessening but it is still bothersome.

A 50-year-old female patient received the first dose of the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: UNKNOWN), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 (at the age of 50-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included tachycardia, tension headache, and glucose tolerance impaired.  Concomitant medications included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), gabapentin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and metoprolol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  On 18Dec2020, the patient experienced hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, tetany, muscle cramps, and hemoglobin dropped little bit.  The clinical course was as follows: The patient received the vaccine and about 30 minutes later she started to &#34;feel bad&#34;. She went to the urgent care and about an hour after they took her to the emergency room (also reported as hospital). She had a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and magnesium level done on the 18th, 21th, 23rd, 26th, 28th, 30th of Dec2020 and then again on 04Jan2021.  On 18Dec2020, her initial lab test showed potassium: 2.6, hemoglobin: 10.2, magnesium: 1.2, and calcium: 5.7. The physician assistant reported that a potassium of 2.6 was critically low and a hemoglobin was 10.2 was about normal for the patient. She received oral medications of potassium 20 mEq twice a day and calcium and magnesium supplements once a day. On 04Jan2021, lab data showed:  potassium: 4.2, magnesium: 2.1, calcium: 9.5 and hemoglobin: 14.5. Per the reporting physician assistant, the above levels went back to normal but stated she had to be supplemented to get back to that point. The clinical outcomes of the hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hemoglobin dropped little bit were recovered on 04Jan2021; while that of the tetany and muscle cramps, were unknown. The physician assistant assessed the events as related to the suspect vaccine.   The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162B2 on reported events cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I had chills with the shaking, and sat on the sofa with a blanket and heater until the symptoms resided.

Pain progressed over the next 5 days to arm and left eye. Dizziness, mouth drooping, and numbness developed. Went to ED and diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Evaluated in ED for possible causes. Vital signs stable. CVA ruled out. Patient given ketorolac, droperidol, and IV fluids for her headache. Prescribed steroids and acyclovir for Bell&#39;s Palsy treatment. Prescriber instructed patient to return to ED immediately if symptoms worsen or additional symptoms develop. Follow up with patient on 1/5/21 with patient reporting some improvement in symptoms.  Patient reported having a headache for 2 weeks straight prior to presenting to the ED on 1/3/21. Vaccine was administered on 12/28/21. Unsure if the Bell&#39;s Palsy was a result of the vaccine or some other inciting factor.

                                                Arm was very sore; Muscle aches; Scratchy throat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 50-year-old female patient (non-pregnant) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: 9899), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm, on 21Dec2020 at 19:00, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included attention deficit disorder (ADD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), migraines, allergies to latex and cinnamon (severe), gluten intolerance, and lactose intolerant. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included amfetamine aspartate/ amfetamine sulfate/ dexamfetamine saccharate/ dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), candesartan, galcanezumab GNLM (EMGALITY), glucosamine, magnesium, melatonin, iron, escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO), omeprazole, ursodiol, colecalciferol (VIT D3), and buspirone hydrochloride (BUSPAR). The patient previously took acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN), fentanyl, and codeine and experienced allergies to the medications. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered in a hospital. On 22Dec2020 at 9 AM, the patient&#39;s arm was very sore and had some muscle aches and scratchy throat. These lasted a little over 48 hours (2 days). The events were considered non-serious. No treatment was received for the adverse events. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient recovered from the events on 24Dec2020.

                                                We (myself and 2 other pharmacists) were conducting a COVID-19 vaccine clinic. The patient is on staff at the clinic and came in for her 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID vaccine. 10 minutes post-vaccination, patient started experiencing SOB, tingling fingers and face, and swelling of her lips and tongue. She moved herself outside to cooler air and then sent someone back inside to ask us for help. I ran outside with an EpiPen and immediately noted her pulse of 158 on her watch and she appeared to be experiencing an anaphylactic reaction. Patient stated she did not want to use the EpiPen but wanted to try chewing Benadryl instead first. I asked the staff for a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. The 1st readings, approximately 12 minutes after vaccination, were HR 158, BP 155/105, and pulse ox 97%. Patient stated the Benadryl was working and her swelling was decreasing. The patient was not having trouble breathing at the time. I continued monitoring vitals and talking with the patient and approximately 20 minutes post-vaccination, she was improving (BP down to 134/80 and HR 120) but agreed we should call 911. She decided she wanted to move inside and lie down. I escorted her with support to a bed. Her vitals then increased again to BP 152/95 and HR 133 and her lips and tongue started swelling again. The patient appeared to be more labored in breathing then but still refused the EpiPen. Roughly 5 minutes after lying down, the medics showed up and took over and I went back to the vaccination area. I learned later that the patient refused to go to the hospital and after more observation was eventually allowed to leave with a friend/coworker driving her home.

The pain subsided and then I had liquid stooling for about 8 hrs with intermittent hot flashes.  I am still having an &#34;odd&#34; feeling in my head, like foggy sensation, vertigo, and the sweating episodes as we speak.

                                                Delayed Localized allergic reaction.  Approximately 24 hours after shot, I developed hives and swelling on cheeks, chin and swelling of lips.  Immediately took 25mg of Benadryl.   Sought treatment at an UTC for evaluation.   I did not have trouble breathing and oxygen saturation was good, always above 97%.  Upon reaching clinic 1 hour later, swelling and redness had gone down.  Doctor diagnosed it as a localized allergic reaction to vaccine.  I was given another 25mg of Benadryl and prescribed prednisone 20mg for 3 days.   Swelling and redness has been intermittent since yesterday.   All swelling and hives are confined to the face.  I have been taking 50mg pf Benadry every 6-8 hours continuing this evening.  It should be noted that I pre medicated with Benadryl the 2 nights before vaccination, the morning of, 1 hour after the shot and late evening the day I received the vaccine.  I knew with my history of allergies I was at higher risk of allergic reaction.   Please note the facial, eye and lip swelling began the following morning,  12 hours AFTER my last dose of Benadryl.

                                                The day after receiving the second COVID-19 vaccine, I had a massive headache, to the point where I stayed in bed and slept all day.   I also noticed that my brain was foggy.  The next day I was able to move to the couch, but the headache was still severe with continued brain fog.  I called by PCP to see if there was anything that I needed to be doing or taking and she told me that I should start feeling better the next week.   The headache remains but is mild.  I have memory loss and difficulty concentrating.  I am a nurse and over my weekend at work, I had difficulty doing my job because I couldn&#39;t keep track of what I was supposed to be doing and had difficulty charting.  My coworkers even commented that I seemed &#34;really different&#34;, that my memory was poor, I had personality changes (according to one person) and that my standard of care was much less than usual.  One person also commented that seemed to not be able to hear her and kept asking her to repeat herself.  I find myself having to concentrate harder to see when I am reading or typing something.  I missed work on January 14 and 15 because of the mental fogginess and headache.  I thought I was doing better, but I realized that I wasn&#39;t when I returned to work on January 23 and 24.  I have spoken to my PCP on the phone once and am awaiting calls from my PCP and neurologist regarding this event.

                                                1st dose on 12/31/2020.  Within 5 minutes of vaccine became severely dizzy, became briefly tachycardic with diffuse warmth and claminess.  EMS was called after it didn&#39;t resolve after 20-30 minutes.  Blood sugar 123.  BP was elevated to high 160&#39;s over high 90s.  EMS transported me to the ER.   1 liter of fluids given and BP was back to normal.   Head CT scan was done and was normal.  Dizziness persisted for about 6 hours and I was very tired for the rest of the day with achiness noted in the evening.  I was fine by the next day. 2nd dose received on 1/21/21.  I had only slight dizziness after that dose and was able to leave after 30 minutes observation time.  Was very tired the weekend following vaccine and have had periods of dizziness/nausea since Sunday1/24/2021.  I am still feeling dizzy and nauseated 1/27/21 and was encouraged to report possible side effect to the vaccine.

                                                Got booster shot on Wednesday the 20th, came home and was fatigued. Thursday had horrible headache that would not be relieved with tylenol. I took a plane and arrived at 1130 pm. I went to bed shortly after arriving at my daughters house. Friday morning, I was unable to be woken up and my daughter called 911. I was in a coma. I suffered cardiac arrest during a CT to check for clots. I was resuscitated and put on life support. CT scan for clots, strokes, heart attacks were all clear. I was admitted to the C-ICU and on life support, on the ventilator, and was on 3 different medications at max dosage to keep my blood pressure barely surviving. The doctors told my daughter not to expect me to survive because they had no idea why I was suddenly so ill.  A doctor then told my daughter that my kidneys were failing, and my liver was damaged.  I also developed a high fever and had a high white blood cell count. They gave me Vancomycin and another antibiotic, and then the next the day a kidney doctor gave me lasix to flush out all of the excess fluid. I woke up on Saturday not knowing what had happened and was completely terrified and confused. My daughter was allowed into the ICU to see me and keep me calm, thankfully. She explained to me what happened. I am still in the hospital, as they are keeping me for observation and trying to determine if my kidneys will start working properly again.  Prior to this, I have only ever had a kidney infection, and I thought before I might have had the start of a UTI.  I do have chronic high blood pressure as well, a long term side effect from open heart surgery 10 years prior for an aneurysm, but aside from that I am relatively healthy 50 year old.

                                                Received the 2nd shot on 2/11/2021. I started feeling a little &#34;off&#34; later in the evening. I woke up at 0300 with severe joint pain, headache and chills. Nausea started shortly afterwards. The joint pain was excruciating and it was very difficult to move. By 0330, I started vomiting. Vomiting continued until approximately 0745. I felt dehydrated but was not able to hold down any water. I contacted the Nurse Advice line and spoke to a nurse. She asked me a series of questions, all relating to signs indicative of an allergic reaction. I knew I was not experiencing a typical allergic reaction. But I was experiencing a bad reaction. Based on my responses to her questions, she did not recommend that I go an Urgent Care Clinic or see a Doctor. The severe joint pain continued through 02/14/2021. I started to feel better on 02/15/2021. Even though I did not experience an allergic reaction, given the severity of my joint pain and vomiting, I still feel it is important for what I did experience to be documented. Thank you.

                                                Transcription of a text I sent to my colleagues:  Hi all--I&#39;m not sure who has received the second vaccine, but I wanted to update as to my experience.  I got sick with the first one from about 4ish hours after until the next mid morning maybe?  Then I felt bad again that second night.  I had my vaccine (second) yesterday at 4 PM, and I felt OK going to bed but had a pretty pitiful night.  I woke up at 5 AM and I felt horrible.  That felt like someone took a pair of metal cymbals and slammed them together on my head.  The tinnitus was strong.  I also had body aches and joint pain and felt like I had the flu.  I felt a little better around 1 PM, but felt bad again around 330.  Now I&#39;m miserable again with terrible body aches and chills (this was at 7:38 PM).  I&#39;m sure I will feel better in the morning, just wanted to share my experience.&#34;  Sadly, since then, I have had tinnitus with a metallic ringing in both ears along with hearing loss.  I had some vertigo one day but unsure if this was related.  The tinnitus makes me very sad.  I am a hospitalist and am happy to have been vaccinated, still.  It has been 2 months today, and it remains, unrelenting.  It is worse in the morning and at night.  The hearing loss is difficult.

                                                4 to 5 hours post vaccination I began to get very dizzy or &#34;woozy&#34;, had a pounding heart sensation, felt very &#34;clammy&#34;, and had general ague upon any type of exertion such as walking a very short distance using my rolling walker device.  This happened 3 times in approximately 2 hours on the day of vaccination.  The next day (03/05/21) my blood pressure and heart rate were very elevated (BP 174/111, Heart Rate 168); I went to the emergency room where they were unable to lower my heart rate but sent me home anyway.  03/7/21 I went to ER, where I was diagnosed with atrial flutter and admitted. The atrial flutter was corrected via cardioversion and I was released 3/9/21; I was prescribed Multaq 400mg, 2X/day and take it faithfully.

She said she felt very far away and just kept repeating I don&#39;t feel well. She was diaphoretic and her chest was very red and she kept scratching and rubbing it at it. I asked if she wanted IM Benadryl or epipen and she at first denied. She also said she felt like she needed to focus on her breathing. At this time we decided it was best to administer Epipen x 1 dose. Immediately after she felt better. She was observed for another 30 minutes and then went home. at 7:17pm I called and spoke with her. She said her arm was sore and that her oxygen levels were about 88-89% which is low for her but she said she felt fine and is currently working right now.

They transported me to the ED. I was given 1 L of fluid and monitored and rested for about an hour, then I felt fine. No other tests or meds given

                                                After 20 minutes my heart started to race and pound in my chest, I was flushed and had a dry mouth. I sat and monitored what was happening and then notified the staff that it was not improving. I was directed to go to the ER for further evaluation and went. They monitored me and it resolved after about 3 hours and went home. No other issues occurred.

A 51-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot#: EH9899) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 28Dec2020 (at 10:30 or 11:00 AM) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, all reported as family history (her parent). There were no concomitant medications. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There was no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The patient did not have prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had body ache (reported as medically significant) on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovering, had been sick for a week/ very ill on 28Dec2020 with outcome of unknown, sneezing on 28Dec2020 with outcome of not recovered, chills on 01Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, headache on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovering, coughing on 01Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, tiredness on 01Jan2021 with outcome of unknown,  nasal congested on 01Jan2021 with outcome of not recovered, feels like her sinus were blocked on 01Jan2021 with outcome of unknown. Treatment was received for the events. Reported she had a lot of sickness, by evening that day (28Dec2020) she got sneezing and feeling sick. Then the next day was the same, then the third day. She became very ill with chills, body ache, headache, coughing, and tiredness on 01Jan2021 (also reported as 3 days later vaccination). And she had no fever, but stated she had been sick for a week. Added the headache and body ache were a little better but still she felt so congested. Clarified she had nasal congested that feels like her sinus were blocked. She treated herself with acetaminophen, once daily 500 mg by mouth starting 01Jan2021. Added the body ache pain was still on the back of her chest but her legs and arms were better. She used steam inhalation for the congestion. She was not scheduled for the next dose yet, she was just waiting. The patient was wondering if she should do a test for COVID 19. Mentioned she had been healthy all through this year and digging in the COVID 19 all the time but then after the vaccine she got so sick. This was the first day she could get up and did anything. Advised caller to consult her HCP.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently provided, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the body ache.

She stayed 15 minutes for observation and was feeling fine, however 30 minutes after vaccine administration started feeling her left upper lip was swollen and tip of her tongue felt thick. When she looked in the mirror her lip and tongue appeared normal, but she had the sensation they were swollen. She then took 50 mg of PO Benadryl and about 4 hours later felt swelling had resolved. Today, feels normal. Pt denies hx of allergies but her mother has a hx of anaphylaxis with IV contrast. EE denies throat tightness, SOB, wheezing. Numbness on left leg.  Advised EE to go to ER if she experiences throat tightness and itchyness, SOB, or wheezing. Advised pt that she should consult her PCP to decide whether or not the benefits of recieving the second dose of the vaccine outweigh the risks and if she should pre-medicate with benadryl for the second dose if she choses to recieve it. &#34;

A 51-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EH9899, expiration date Mar2021), intramuscular on left arm, on 18Dec2020 at 0.3 mL, a single dose for vaccination. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine and she tested positive with Covid. She received the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 18Dec2020. She was exposed to the virus through close personal contact right around this same time-frame and did develop the virus herself.  She wanted to know if there were any recommendations regarding her needing to get the second dose in series.  She stated that her husband, who was not vaccinated, had the virus and developed more serious symptoms than she did.  She is concerned about worsening side effects with the second dose and stated that she felt like crap the night after her first dose with chills and arm pain. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 on 26Dec2020. Specific test name was unknown, but she knows it was not a rapid test. She is scheduled to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine on 08Jan2021. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose relative to the COVID-19 diagnosis. She has not been able to find the information she is asking about. The outcome of the event of Covid-19 was recovering while other events was unknown. The Covid-19 was assessed as unrelated to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment. COVID-19 antigen test positive.

Vaccine location was arm. None medical history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient stated she had the COVID vaccine on Dec18th, her first one and she was fine, no issues and she would say the following Wednesday (23Dec2020), she started getting like a hot flash, it lasted whole day and then her feet started itching. And now, she have got itching all over her whole body and especially in her hands and her feet all the time. She went to her family doctor. She have not had this issue before and she don&#39;t have any known allergies. And she went to family doctor and he prescribed some antihistamines and of course they are still bothering patient. Besides itching, she was not having any other complication. Patient went to family doctor last week and he put her on a prescription of antihistamine trying to help. It is not helping, Benadryl helped her. When probed for the name of the product, patient stated she think the name of it is Lyrica. The events were persisting. She had better times but then it was other times when it is worse. When asked the causality, the patient stated she think so. She has never had a reaction like this and it has been going on everyday ever since. The only thing that worries is she was due to get her second one on the 8th which is this Friday and she have heard people rumors saying that when get second vaccine, whatever symptoms she was having are even worse. Patient don&#39;t know is it true. And of course everyone is saying like, normally they say - any reactions you get like the first 24-48 hours but her didn&#39;t happen until almost halfway till first week.

A 51-years-old female patient (no pregnant) started to receive bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number el3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jan2021 11:00 at the first single dose at left arm for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included supraventricular tachycardia, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, hypermobility syndrome, developmental hip.  Concomitant medication included hydrocortisone, trazodone, levothyroxine sodium (LEVOTHROID), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN).

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: negative on 06Jan2021.  The outcome of events was recovering. No other vaccine in four weeks; No covid prior vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of anaphylaxis presented as throat tightening/tingling/soreness, dry wheezy cough a little dizziness and tachycardia. Itching, numb R foot, Low grade temp and chills and headache cannot be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship and the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  The underlying predisposing condition of drug allergies may put the patient at high risk of anaphylactic reactions. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I took 25 of Benadryl and went about my evening. Tuesday around 12:00 I had that same sensation but a little stronger, I would call it a tongue swelling but no resp issues or swallowing problems. I called my PCP and he recommended me to take Zyrtec (which I take 1 daily) BID and Benadryl prn. I took 3 doses of Benadryl Tuesday and a Zyrtec Tuesday night and one Wednesday and  around 8:15 had the same sensation, tongue swelling but milder. I immediately took 50 mg of Benadryl and called my Dr again and he recommended a steroid pack and Benadryl prn and to not take the 2nd dose.

                                                Pt received COVID vaccine on 12/27/2020 at 1421 and tolerated well. By 1700 that same day, pt felt flushed in her hands and face. She felt a little short of breath. She started to get fluid-filled blisters on bilateral palms. This is a milder form of the reaction pt has to flu vaccines (she was advised by PCP not to receive flu vaccines because of the blistering). Pt took diphenhyramine 25 mg PO x 1 and the fluid-filled blisters resolved within a few hours.  12/28 around 0330, pt awoke and felt like her right carotid was &#34;pulsating.&#34; Pt drank water, did not go back to sleep. &#34;Pulsating&#34; resoved within an hour. No other symptoms develped. In the morning, pt called employee health RN who instructed her to contact PCP and report the reaction. Pt called PCP who advised pt not to get second dose of vaccine due to her reaction to COVID and the flu vaccines.

At work at 10:00am I began to get fatigued chills overall body aches but was afebrile. I also had nasal congestion and sneezing for 4 hrs. that resolved. At 12 noon I felt progressively worse and had to leave work. I got home and my temp was 100.2 and took more Ibuprofen at 1 PM. At 2PM the body aches and chills were pretty severe- my temp rose to 103.2. I took more Ibuprofen and alternated with TYLENOL and it returned to normal at 10 PM. I notified my Drs office and had a telemedicine visit with Dr at 4PM who thought it was a normal immune response but suggested getting a COVID Test in the meantime before returning to work. I woke up this morning afebrile with no issues notified employee health got a referral and had my COVID test completed at 09:30am. The urgent care MD strongly urged me to report to VAERS, not just CDC as I had yesterday. My COVID tests are still pending.

                                                Day 7 post vaccine, woke with vertigo, nausea and double vision prior to my alarm going off at 5:30am, told my husband that I did not feel right and it felt like something was wrong with me. I asked him to send a message to work that I was not feeling well and would not be in. I was not able to see my phone clearly as I had double vision.  I went back to sleep to try to get relief, woke up and called out to husband for help and he said I was just making groaning noises but I know in my head I was saying please help me as I could not move my right side and I was not sleeping or having a dream. At approximately 9:30am my husband kept telling me someone was trying to text me and needed a response. I tried to get up and still could not move my right side. He helped me sit up and I could not use my right arm and hand. He helped me get some clothes on and took me to the ED. When we arrived I still could not use my right hand and my arm still felt weak. The weakness resolved within a couple of hours and I got the strength back in my hand.   I did have some concern that my TIA type symptoms could possibly be related to vaccine but it was just a thought until I received my second dose. 3 hours post vaccine my face became numb and tingly. It remained that way until I went to sleep. This is why I am reporting this incident.

                                                received my shot at 8:15 am, within approximately  45min I felt a very slight heaviness to my breathing something similar to allergy season belreathing, and a slight headache on my rr temple. This was nothing that stopped me or slowed me down that day.   At approx 10:30pm I awoke from a deep sleep with SHARP chest pains, at 11pm chills, 1am fever and discomfort, 2am muscle aches.  I slept on my left side to keep blood circulating to my heart which seemed to ease some of my discomfort. My first night was rough. I awoke Thurs (12/24) with a swollen left foot and leg. some rt leg pain, joint pain in my left knee. I pushed myself to get up and move and go about my day. Friday, I still had a little left foot foot swelling and pain, knee pain, but kept pushing. The handout says if symptoms persist for longer than 24-48 to seek medical care, I have not.  Friday, (12/25/20)was Christmas and much of the day was non eventful. At approx 530pm. I felt a bulging not in the center of my chest which was tender to the touch. This concerned me. I gently messaged the area, rested a bit but continued to move up and down the stairs. That discomfort and the bulge decreased within a few hours.   Saturday, (12/26) 4:am and I have notice much of the swelling in my foot and legs has decreased, however, I now have bruising. The sore arm is gone, and I am hopefully, all is well. I forgot to mention, I have had intermittent persistent cough with slight sob, something similar to the start of allergy season, but it is brief. I have been coughing at night. I have a history of whooping cough. And gastric bypass.

The 51-year-old patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were unknown) intramuscular (upper left arm), on 21Dec2020, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization/ prophylaxis. Relevant medical history included root canal. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient previously took thimerosal (preservative) and experienced allergy. Patient knows the vaccine is preservative free. The patient received the first dose on 21Dec2020. She had a slight allergic reaction where she experienced itchiness immediately after the injection in the injection area (itching in the arm) and the itchiness spread to parts of her body like the back of her throat, tongue, area of the leg, the face, the head. She took three Benadryl as treatment for these events. The patient recovered completely that same evening (on 21Dec2020) before she went to bed around 10 or 11 that night after her third Benadryl. She was due to go back to get her second dose between 11Jan2021 and 13Jan2021, next week. She is concerned about getting the second dose since she had somewhat of a reaction with the first dose. She had to have a root canal and she was taking an antibiotic which she clarifies as a Z-pack, azithromycin. States her last antibiotic pill is due to be taken on Monday, 11Jan2021. She was asking if she can get the second dose. She is also concerned about how she may react to the 2nd dose of the vaccine while taking Azithromycin. They were informed at work that the 2nd dose of the vaccine should be administered between days 21 and 23 after the first one. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Took Tylenol every 4 hrs and fever (101. 5)returns in 1-2 hrs. Pulse ox remained normal, 98%, but pulse was 99/min. Usually my resting pulse ox is 55/minutes.  Was unable to go to work and see patients.  Had these symptoms for 48 hrs even though stayed in bed, took Tylenol around the clock and drank plenty of fluids (2-3 liters of water in addition to natural orange and apple juices). Never lost appetite either, do eating my vegetables and fish diet. Ice cream help between Tylenol?s. Completely resolved after 72 hrs. Now still have  LEFT  injection site tender deltoid and left axillary tender nodes, improving as well. All along breathing fine, no cough or congestion or sore throat. No anosmia  or dysgeusia.  This was after my second Pfizer dose.  After the First dose only had tenderness on the RIGHT deltoid muscle injection site and tender axillary node, resolved by now.

Started having symptoms a couple of hours after 2 dose of vaccine. Feels like nerves are burning in these areas. Intense headache 24 hrs after shot. Took Tylenol 500 mg with no relief. Took naproxen 550 mg Tuesday night around 10 pm. Resolved headache but not burning sensation around mucus membranes. Got progressively worse. Saw MD on Friday who did pelvic exam. Confirmed vaginitis. Prescribed Medrol dosepak, refresh vaginal lubricant and topical desitin. Currently on day 4 on Medrol dospak with some relief. Burning sensation now comes and goes and is not constant. Again, the burning sensation feels like the nerves in the areas of mucus membranes are inflamed.

A 51-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EL1284) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was none.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  At first, she thought she was having a reaction, but then she started feeling sick so she got tested. She was positive so she wasn&#39;t having a reaction. She was scared from the pain of COVID. She experienced sickness. Her stomach was still weirded out. She did experience arm pain from the vaccine. Her doctor told her it was fine that it needed to air out. She left the bandage on too long.  She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She received the vaccine on the 29Dec2020. She tested positive 02Jan2020. The arm wasn&#39;t swollen it was just burning. She was sick to her stomach when she got the stomach. The sick to the stomach lasted maybe two days, but then she got COVID. The burning was around the arm. It wasn&#39;t that bad. It lasted for a day. It started the day she got the shot (on the 29Dec2020). On 07Jan2021, she went to the hospital because her kidneys were hurting. The doctor said her kidneys were good. They did labs which were good. She was still going through body aches. She was told she was currently in the worst part of the virus. She still had a sour stomach going on from the virus as well. The outcome of the body aches and sour stomach was not recovered, for other events was unknown.

                                                An hour after I had the vaccine, I started having headaches, followed by slight vertigo.  I took Tylenol as soon as I got home due to symptoms getting worse.  That night I went to bed at 10pm and didn?t wake up till 7:45am (I was dead tired, I didn?t even hear my  alarm).  Jan/19/21. Soon as I got up, I experienced headache, vertigo, and this time with mild body aches/heavy feeling and  mental fog (Tylenol helped relieved symptoms).  Towards the afternoon, I also felt mild burning sensation in my eyes and somehow I felt hot flashes around my face only.  Been taking my temperature with normal results.   Jan/20/21  Still experiencing off/on headaches and light headedness, otherwise feels okay.  All symptoms gone by end of the day.

Was given Benadryl and Steiroid. chest x ray given which was normal. EKG taken which was abnormal but told was consistent with an older EKG. Was feeling better and about 90 minutes later felt warmth over my heart, my lips and mouth became tingly and both arms went numb and uncertain if my heart monitor showed abnormal. Was admitted overnight for observation. About 10 hours later had warmth in my chest, heart started beating fast, numbness in arms and around mouth and slight tightness in throat. Benadryl administered and heart calmed after couple of minutes, numbness went away after couple of minutes and tightness in throat went away after an hour.  Again about 13 hours later the warmth in chest and heart racing only symptoms. Given another dose of Benadryl. The symptoms only lasted a couple of minutes.  I also saw a cardiologist who ordered an echocardiogram just to rule out anything with my heart. It was normal.  I was sent home with instructions to use Bendryl oral for 3 days every 12 hours. I was told it could be from vaccine and I was to follow symptoms for 2 weeks and if not better to see cardiologist to look at other reasons.

A 51-year-old female patient received 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration on 30Dec2020 12:00 at single dose on deltoid left for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included patient was working in healthcare and around Covid positive patients daily.  There were no concomitant medications. 10 minutes after getting bnt162b2, patient noticed side effects. Patient had a metallic taste in throat and a few more things. Right after getting it she had a flushed feeling in her body and legs, similar like IV contrast. 10 minutes after that so about 20 minutes later she had mid chest tightness and weakness that was gone after about 40 minutes to an hour. Patient was unable to provide any seriousness criteria, stating it was scary for a moment and she didn&#39;t know what it was, but the mid chest tightness could have progressed to something more serious. That was how she felt at that moment, but after it was all gone, it was not serious. She did not know why or what the reason was or if she was lucky or what. Patient was sitting for 10 minutes after receiving Pfizer COVID vaccine and was doing something on her phone when she started experiencing these symptoms unexpectantly. Eventually the nurses observing her after a half hour took her to the emergency room since she wasn&#39;t feeling any better. Patient had emergency room visit for all events. Outcome of events was resolving.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported mid chest tightness and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the plausible temporal association and lacking alternative explanations.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

A 51-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL0142, expiry date not reported) on 07Jan2021 intramuscularly in left deltoid muscle at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID), amlodipine besilate/ atorvastatin calcium (CADUET). The patient received the vaccine and then had COVID. On 07Jan2021 Thursday, the patient received the vaccine, and on Tuesday (12Jan2021) she said she was not feeling good. On Thursday (14Jan2021) she went to work and because she was not feeling good, she was tested and she was tested positive. The patient worked in a nursing home where she had been tested almost everyday. She was tested negative before she got the vaccine. She was at home, not receiving treatment for COVID. The reporter didn&#39;t understand why the patient (reporter&#39;s wife) got the vaccine and then had COVID. The outcome of the event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect BNT162B2 cannot be excluded for the reported event tested positive based on the known safety profile. However the short duration of 7 days since the vaccine first dose is given it is unlikely patient would have fully developed immunity.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 25Jan2021 this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 51-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3247, expiration date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 17:45 at single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing severe Crohn&#39;s disease, pneumonia, allergy to eggs/anaphylactic reactions to eggs, anaphylactic with bee stings on 2020 (this has happen twice in 2020), collapsed her lung (reaction to anesthesia that collapsed her lung), high fever, anaphylactic reactions. Concomitant medication included sertraline (SERTRALINE), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]). The patient previously took Hep B and experienced fever, flu like symptoms, achy, and lethargic (no issue with the first 2 doses but with the 3rd dose she had a high fever); MMR and had an adverse reaction. It was reported that the shot was given on 19Jan2021. She experienced the following severe dizziness which started that day (17:45) and lasted 3 days. It has resolved. Nausea which started that day (17:45) and stayed constant for 3 days. Now it has only been happing in the late afternoons or evenings. Light headed which started that day and last 3 days. Headache (17:45), the initial headache felt like her whole head was going to explode into a 1000 piece. Now it just starts about 4-5pm in the evening. It was better and not as severe but like a migraine with nausea (17:45), feeling crappy (17:45), and body aches. Body aches which started on the day of the shot (17:45) and lasted 3 days. Fatigue which started on the day she got the shot (17:45) and was ongoing in the evening now chills and sweats which started on the day she got the shot and was ongoing. Her husband asked about if this was being related to the change of life but she doesn&#39;t think so. Fever which happened on the day she got the shot (17:45) but not at the site, later that night and was 105.00 with Tylenol. It has resolved. She noted that her blood pressure tends to be low but was 95/81 at the time she got the shot (17:45). The patient has not taken her blood pressure and does know if this has resolved. It was relayed that she took Tylenol and Benadryl before the shot due to her history and was still taking it as treatment for the symptoms. She has a lot of drug and other allergies, the only that was anaphylaxis was bees and egg. This was why she brought 2 EpiPens when she had the shot. She didn&#39;t have to use her EpiPen and was really proud of that but did have some reactions.  The patient reported she did not go to the doctor. At this point she was somewhat expected that she had a not great reaction so the fact that she could still breath after getting it was a good thing.

A 51-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6200, expiry date: 21Feb2021), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 17Feb2021 15:40, as single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus from 2012 to (diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus almost 9 years ago), neuropathy in her feet/nerves and reported that she only turns pink if she gets overheated. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Historical vaccines included influenza vaccine (reported as flu vaccine) which she gets every year and pneumococcal vaccine (reported as pneumonia vaccine) which she gets every 5 years. The patient reported that she received her first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 17Feb2021 and had an allergic reaction. She said she was at a podiatry appointment, and her podiatrist told her the pharmacy had an extra COVID-19 Vaccine available. She said the pharmacy staff came to her podiatrist&#39;s office to administer her COVID-19 Vaccine. She said about 5 minutes after she received the COVID-19 Vaccine injection, on 17Feb2021 15:45, her left arm started feeling flushed, her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck. She said 20 minutes later, she walked from her podiatrist&#39;s office to a nurse&#39;s station to be monitored further. She said while she was at the nurse&#39;s station, a doctor came by twice to evaluate. She clarified the upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red. She said her podiatrist asked her if that was a normal reaction for her. She said she told her podiatrist she only turns pink if she gets overheated. She said her left hand got numb and tingly. She said the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were &#34;twingey&#34;. She said her podiatrist and his nurse felt both her arms, and said her left arm was much warmer than her right arm. While she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored, she felt short of breath. She said she wasn&#39;t sure if she was short of breath because of her nerves. She said her oxygen level was checked and it was at 99%. She said her pulse was 101, her blood pressure was 118/76, and her blood glucose finger stick test was 128. She said she was told by the staff monitoring her, she should expect her blood glucose number to skyrocket because there is a steroid in the COVID-19 Vaccine shot. She said the staff also mentioned she can expect blood glucose spikes as the COVID-19 Vaccine&#39;s steroid goes through her system. Her fingers in her left hand became itchy while she was at the nurse&#39;s station being monitored. It was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers. She said she asked for an ice pack to put on her left hand because she uses ice packs for neuropathy in her feet, and she felt an ice pack would help with the itch and burning feeling in her left hand fingers. The doctor came to look at her again and wanted to give her IV Benadryl. Then the doctor decided against the IV Benadryl because she would be too sleepy to drive home but the doctor did eventually give her an intramuscular injection of Benadryl 25mg (clarified as Diphenhydramine 25mg in a syringe) in her upper right arm. Within 5 minutes the itching in her left hand fingers calmed down, and the redness in her left arm calmed down to a pink color. She said 20 minutes later her left arm was still pink and warm. She said she was told by the doctor if her reaction moved out of the localized area of her left arm, to go to the Emergency Room, and to use an icepack, again, on her left hand. When she arrived home, her husband said she looked like she had hives and a rash going down her left arm. Her left arm was not itchy though. She clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist. She reported that while she was at her podiatrist&#39;s office her left arm was a solid pink. She then mentioned that when she goes out in the sun and gets overheated, she turns pink. She said from her left shoulder to left elbow was warm to the touch. She said by the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site. She said the COVID-19 Vaccine injection site is sore and her left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site. She reported there were no blotchy, red marks on her left arm on 18Feb2021. She said her left arm is a pretty normal on 18Feb2021. The nurse who monitored her after the COVID-19 Vaccine shot said she needed to report her allergic reaction. She was told she needs to let the COVID-19 Vaccine staff know of her reaction before she gets her second COVID-19 Vaccine injection, so she can be monitored closely. She took no other treatment after she returned home from receiving her COVID-19 Vaccine. She reported she had a headache on 18Feb2021, clarifying her whole head hurts, and the headache has been persisting all day. She said she experienced tiredness, as well. She said the tiredness started on 17Feb2021 and can be partially attributed to the Diphenhydramine 25mg injection she was given. Her husband told her she looked completely wiped out, and pale when she got home after getting her COVID-19 Vaccine on 17Feb2021. She said she remembers being tired when she got home because her eyes were squinty. She reported feeling more tired on 18Feb2021 and her whole left arm and left hand are sore. She clarified her blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021. The patient recovered from the events &#34;her fingers in her left hand became itchy/it was a deep down itch in her left hand fingers&#34; on 17Feb2021; from &#34;upper part of her left arm started turning pink, and then red&#34; and &#34;rash going down her left arm/clarified the blotchy red marks go in a line from the inside of her top left elbow down to her left wrist&#34; on 18Feb2021; from &#34;her left hand got numb and tingly&#34;, &#34;the muscles in her left arm between the inside of her left elbow down to the inside of her left wrist were twingey&#34;, short of breath, &#34;burning feeling in her left hand fingers&#34; and &#34;she looked completely wiped out, and pale&#34; in Feb2021; was recovering from &#34;left arm started feeling flushed&#34;; has not recovered from &#34;her left arm started getting hot, and the hot sensation traveled down her left arm to her left hand, and up to her left shoulder and neck/her left arm was much warmer than her right arm&#34;, &#34;blood glucose was at 295 when she checked before bedtime of 17Feb2021, and at 185 before breakfast in the morning of 18Feb2021&#34;, &#34;there is a flush color around the vaccine injection site, but not on the vaccine injection site&#34;, &#34;Injection site pain/injection site is sore&#34;, &#34;left shoulder is warm to the touch around her COVID-19 Vaccine injection site&#34;, &#34;looked completely wiped out/Tiredness&#34;, &#34;Headache&#34; and &#34;her whole left arm and left hand are sore&#34;.

                                                Approximately 20-30 minutes after receiving the vaccine I noticed around my eyes and upper lip was tingling and felt numb. I continued to close up my desk to leave work for the day thinking it would just go away in few minutes. When I got to my vehicle I took two Benadryl capsules and drank a bottle of water and waited nearby the hospital emergency department parking area for 30 - 40 minutes. The numbness had eased and I drove home.  Tuesday and today (Wednesday) I have felt very tired and fatigued.

                                                About 10 to 12 minutes after the injection, I started feeling like my throat was constricted.  I felt pain in my temple and I also felt like my ears were clogged.  My tonugue was tingling and I had pain across my chest.   I had trouble swallowing and taking a deep breath.  The medical providers assessed me and since my heart was not racing and I did not have a rash all over my body, deemed I was okay.  When I went home, I noticed a rash on my chest from my collarbone to my sternum and alongside my ears on my neck.  My sister is an ER Doctor and I did a video conference with her. She had me take Benadryl.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccine nor have I ever had to take Benadryl.

                                                Lymphadenopathy; mild fatigue; Myalgia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 52-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine), intramuscular in the left arm on 12Jan2021 at 16:30 as a single dose to prevent COVID. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported and it was reported that she had no relevant medical history. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Dec2020 at 14:00. The patient did not receive any other vaccine/s on the same date as BNT162B2, did not have prior vaccination within four weeks of receiving BNT162B2, and did not experience any adverse event following prior vaccinations. The patient experienced mild fatigue and myalgia on 13Jan2021, and lymphadenopathy on 14Jan2021. Seriousness for the events was reported as serious (medically significant). The patient received her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 12Jan2021 at 16:30. She experienced mild fatigue and myalgia after 24 hours which has improved. She clarified that the mild fatigue and myalgia resolved by this morning. She felt lymphadenopathy in her lower neck and supraclavicular area. Stated it was almost fullness she can feel, there was no redness and it was not tender. She was hoping this was related to the vaccine that she got in her left upper arm. She went to the CDC and Pfizer website and saw that lymphadenopathy was mentioned but it was a small percentage. The patient declined any treatment. The events did not require a visit to the Emergency Room of Physician&#39;s office. Outcome of the events fatigue and myalgia was recovered on 15Jan2021, while for the event lymphadenopathy  was not recovered. The reporter&#39;s causality assessment between the events and BNT162B2 for the events fatigue and myalgia was related, while for the event lymphadenopathy was unknown.  Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association and drug&#39;s safety profile, the events fatigue, myalgia and lymphadenopathy are possibly related to suspect BNT162B2 administration. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 52-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot no. and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration into left arm on 20Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient is not pregnant. Medical history included allergies to shrimp and lobster, mild asthma and high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included diltiazem, benzoyl peroxide (BP), cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC), loratadine, paracetamol (TYLENOL) and vitamins. The patient had allergies to past blood pressure medications which included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), irbesartan (AVAPRO) and lisinopril. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. After taking first dose about 20 minutes on 20Jan2021 at 13:50 the patient felt slightly lightheaded and had mild headache, no real concern. Left observation area to go home after 45 minutes. No other symptoms at that point. Light headedness went away. While driving and running errands a few hours later the patient noticed her throat was getting somewhat tight, some swelling on 20Jan2021 at 16:30; this is similar to when she used to have shrimp/lobster allergic reactions. The patient took 1 tab of Benadryl before it got too bad and it subsided after about 30 min. No shortness of breath or any more symptoms so she went home and went to sleep after a few hours. She woke up and her throat had still some swelling. She called her doctor and she was recommended to take more allergy meds throught out the day and to report event to facility and to monitor. The swelling has not gone but much better. She was concerned about 2nd shot if it can be given where she was observed and monitored for a day. The patient recovered from slightly lightheaded on unspecified date. The outcome of headache was unknown and the remaining events was recovering.

A 52-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL1283) intramuscular on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included acid reflux, antidepressant, normally wears contacts and puts reading glasses on over it. Family medical history of cancer. Concomitant medication included omeprazole (PROTONIX [OMEPRAZOLE]) for acid reflux and bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN) as antidepressant. The patient went and got her first shot 2 weeks ago. She is a dental assistant. She woke up between 2am-3am on 13Jan2021 and her hands and feet were itching off. They were burning and itching and she did not have any rash. So Thursday, she had to work until 1. Her hands itched and she went home, took Benadryl and put Cortisone cream on hands and feet. She does not have a dose, lot or expiration for either. It would take 2 doses of Benadryl. They just continued to itch until Saturday and she went to a doc in the box and the doctor felt it was a reaction from the vaccine. You could not see anything except red where she scratched it. She gave her some medicine and she just went to pharmacy and the pharmacist said that is just like Benadryl. She started taking it and it immediately helped, but she only gave it to her for 5 days and when she finished, the itching started again. On 27Jan2021, her hands were itching off and she has red streaks going up arms and splotches. She does not have the name. It was like hydro something. She threw bottle away. She does not have a dose, lot or expiration. It improved and stopped when she was taking the medicine and on 26Jan2021, she had a real red spot on wrist, her hands have itched and itched. When her arms started stinging and itching, she pulled her sleeve up and it looks like streaks on her arms and elbows. She has these splotchy red whelps and streaks up her arm. She also noticed she had itching on her torso the day before. She needed to get glasses to see vaccine card. This was required before she took the vaccine, but she did feel like her eyes are worse all of a sudden. She normally wears contacts and puts reading glasses on over it. It has only been in the last few weeks that she has noticed this. Now, her arms were starting to itch again after a dose of Benadryl. She was worried about 2nd shot. She does not want it to get worse and continue. She would like to speak with someone to find out if it would be recommended for her to get second dose or not. No ER or physician&#39;s office required: Doctor visit on 16Jan2021 and they prescribed a medication to help with itching and burning for 5 days and it worked and when she stopped taking it, it started back. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The facility where the vaccine was administered was at a Clinic for the hospital. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of Pfizer suspect. Outcome of the events itching and eyes have gotten worse was not recovered, events burning and pain in arm was unknown and recovering for the other events.

A 52-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 22Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal asthma diagnosed when she was a child and has a rescue inhaler she only uses once in a while if she needs it; she stated her thyroid was giving her problem, she takes a thyroid medicine; and stated weight was thanks to menopause. Concomitant medications included ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C), fish oil (OMEGA 3), and curcuma longa (TURMERIC). The patient reported that she was aggravated and upset on an unspecified date. She reported that she was not feeling bad before taking the shot and nobody was telling her what to do about it. She was asking what she should do about her symptoms of joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue after getting her first vaccination on 22Dec2020. She was crying and stated that her boss can&#39;t tell her anything, she doesn&#39;t want to go to her doctor because, what was he going to tell her. She doesn&#39;t want to waste a copay. She reported taking Advil and Tylenol for her joint pain without relief and asked what else she should do. She stated she wanted directions, she doesn&#39;t want people reading off of a card. She stated she shouldn&#39;t have to pay a copay and she doesn&#39;t want more medicine to mask her symptoms, she wanted an answer. Additionally, the patient was calling about Pfizer COVID shot, she took first dose 22Dec2020, had a reaction, 35 minutes after she sat for 30 minutes, she works at a hospital, and she walked out to her car, she got sick and nauseous, then after the shot, she had flu like symptoms that lasted, and the next day was terrible, it lasted another week and a half, then she took the second shot 11Jan2021, to this day, she still has restless leg syndrome, fatigue, and her joints were hurting her. She had the same thing before, but this hurts a lot worse, and it was not going away, she was taking Turmeric, everything, and everyone says to just keep taking Tylenol or Advil but she can&#39;t keep taking it because now it was upsetting her stomach, or like arthritis medicine, she was taking Omega 3, vitamins, she was 52 years old, she does Spartan races, Cross fit, she does paleo and keto eating, if one looks at her they wouldn&#39;t know she was 52, and she was hurting everyday and doesn&#39;t know what else do to, and doctors weren&#39;t knowledgeable, she doesn&#39;t want a stupid answer. She called work, the CDC knows about it, now VAERS, and they said to call Pfizer, when she calls her doctor she doesn&#39;t want to pay a copayment and get an idiotic answer. She got this because she works at a hospital and she was trying to protect herself and everyone else, she doesn&#39;t like feeling this way, it was to the point she was getting angry, not at Pfizer, but she gets up and runs, with her dog, she was busy all the time, she has 3 boys in the military, and she meets up to do obstacles with them, but she doesn&#39;t feel like doing crap and was miserable everyday. She was a CNA in nursing school. She doesn&#39;t know if she even wanted to see her doctor, she doesn&#39;t want to get an idiotic answer. She hasn&#39;t seen him in while, she switched insurance, been primary for years. Stated this was her first day speaking to DSU before she decides what else to do after this, she was angry. Stated about 35 minutes after the first shot, after 30 minutes they said she could go, she said ok, she walked out to her car, was nauseous and threw up and didn&#39;t eat that morning, and the next day, she felt like she was in a car accident, that was how bad she felt, she had cold chills, flu like stuff that night before, she runs low like 96.6 to 96.8 and she took her temperature, she got in a blanket and went to bed that night, she was 95.5, and didn&#39;t bother taking another temperature, she took a bunch of Advil and went to bed, and Benadryl to go to sleep. This all started on 22Dec2020, and it took about 2 weeks, she just had joint pain, not like now, but those days she didn&#39;t feel good, but by the third week she was ok, and she went to take the second shot next time, and all hell broke loose. The second shot was 11Jan2021, and that night it she noted her joints were starting all over again, and she had restless leg syndrome, cold chills and everything, so she went to bed, she didn&#39;t have Benadryl, so she got up, and that night took Tylenol, she didn&#39;t get very much sleep, and she was very annoyed the next day, she felt like the first time, that like she got it an accident, feeling terrible, that night, and she can lay on the couch to relax, but with the restless leg syndrome, and her joints all day long, she just went yesterday to buy Advil Arthritis, and she never had arthritis before or anything. Restless leg syndrome depends, sometimes it was better than other time. Joint pain was not improving, she was so aggravated about that, she was not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn&#39;t look like she feels good, she doesn&#39;t, and she was ready to bite their heads off, she was very active, always in the gym or something, she has 3 kids in the military, and was always meeting up with them to do military runs and just this was ridiculous. Stated she took a picture of the vaccine card, as she sent it to a few people. This was definitely the Pfizer vaccine, she has told many people, many people know do not take this, she was so irritated, it&#39;s not even funny. The case was reported as non-serious. The outcome was not recovered for the events joint pain, restless leg syndrome and fatigue; and unknown for the rest of the events.

She mentioned that the restless leg syndrome outcome depends, sometimes it is better than other time, as for the joint pain, it was not improving, she is so aggravated about that, she is not feeling 100%, people look at her and say she doesn&#39;t look like she feels good (she doesn&#39;t) and she is ready to bite their heads off since she is very active, always in the gym or something. She started Turmeric since she is desperate, this has been going on since 11Jan2021, anything she is doing now is not doing anything. She does not know what to do as every doctor will say maybe she should see this doctor, but she didn&#39;t feel like this before this shot. She was tired of feeling this way, she didn&#39;t feel this way before the shot, and if anyone met her, they know it. The outcome of the event restless leg syndrome was recovering, arthralgia was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                I developed a raised rash on my left arm at injection site , had chills and nausea and lots of tenderness at injection site at 3 am (1/1/21)  following injection. The nausea had resolved when I woke up, the rash subsided throughout the day as did the chills.  The most distressing event began on 1/1/2021 , that being sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes which continued and got much worse over the next two days, despite taking sudafed as often as possible.  No other cold or flu symptoms were present and it felt like allergies although I have never had any sort of seasonal allergies.  I finally took Zyrtec for it the evening of 1/3/21 and the symptoms stopped.   Congestion, light sensitivity remain.  I am reluctant to take another dose due to  drowsiness side effect.  Hoping symptoms will all be gone by tomorrow.

A 53-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EU9231), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 08:30 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included hypothyroidism and chronic low back pain.  Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.  Concomitant medications included levothyroxine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), baclofen (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and etodolac (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN).  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient previously took miconazole nitrate (MONISTAT) on unknown dates for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy. On 31Dec2020 at 10:00, the patient started with a red raised rash under her arms and waistline and as the day progressed the rash turned hot to touch with raised red large hives all over her body including her face/head. By 23:00 on 31Dec2020, the patient had already taken 3 doses of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) which was not effective. Then, later on 31Dec2020, shortness of breath started with numbness in the hands/feet/chest area. Her daughter took her to the emergency room. She was started on intravenous diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and famotidine (PEPCID). The medications took time to work but they did resolve her shortness of breath and the hives subsided to mild redness.  She was sent home and given the following medications to take: diphenhydramine 50 mg every 4 hours, methylprednisolone (MEDROL DOSE PAK), cetirizine (ZYRTEC) daily, and famotidine (PEPCID) daily. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The clinical outcomes of the red rash, rash was hot to touch, shortness of breath, and numbness, were reported as recovered with lasting effects; while that of the hives was recovering as they still flared up if she did not take the medications every 4 hours. The reporter assessed all the events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported shortness of breath together with red rash was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE together with rash was probably related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course.

                                                Metallic taste in mouth;  cotton/dry mouth while trying to swallow;  flush/tingling sensation throughout body but especially extremities.  Occurred within the 5-15 min observation period.  I did not speak up about it as I was trying to analyze it myself and rationalize the symptoms.  It did not cause tachycardia or SOB or intervention but it makes me a little hesitant for the 2nd dose due to my shellfish allergy/sensitivity.   The sensation reminded me of the systemic response when receiving a contrast IV dye.   I did leave a message at the VAERS 800# to ask if I should submit this form but did not want to delay any longer in case this information is helpful with the feedback/data for others.  I understand it is not a true &#34;adverse or sentinel&#34; event but I wanted to report my reaction especially with the shellfish allergy (which I wasn&#39;t aware of to be a risk factor until I read more articles about it).

                                                Patient developed Tinnitus for 20 minutes immediately after COVID vaccine. Severe joint pain (history Rheumatoid Arthritis) began 4 hours later, and she could barely move hands. She had a severe asthma attack (history asthma) 1 hour later. Breathing has been poor since then with many asthma attacks and oxygen level as low as 79%. Still cannot sleep lying down without oxygen level dropping. Seen at Lung Center 12/31/2020 began tapering prednisone dose beginning at 60mg. Didn&#39;t tolerate 40mg so was at 60mg through 1/9/2021. Now decreased to 40 mg and is having increased shortness of breath and more breakthrough nebulizers. 1/4/2021 feeling no better. Given dexamethasone and kept on steroids. Returned to working just at home on 1/11/2021. No history of asthma reaction this severe in past other than post- ablation, but duration then was shorter.

                                                anaphylactic reaction; arm was really sore; tiredness; dizzy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other health professional (patient). A 53-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (Pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction on an unspecified date, dizzy on 31Dec2020, arm was really sore on an unspecified date, tiredness on an unspecified date. Event details: She was dizzy that day especially with changing positions, she didn&#39;t need to go to the doctor or anything. It wasn&#39;t severe. She was just a little dizzy. It&#39;s probably just the vaccine and it did go away. Her arm was really sore and went away after a few days. the tiredness, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. She did feel better about. it wasn&#39;t a serious anaphylactic reaction. It didn&#39;t happen right away. She had arm soreness. it wasn&#39;t immediate. She usually didn&#39;t have. It was really weird. She thought she was well hydrated. The outcome of event was really sore was resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.   Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the anaphylactic reaction and other reported events due to temporal relationship.  There is very limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

This 53-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine) (dose #1), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 07Jan2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 53-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included food allergy (shellfish) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, drug hypersensitivity (sulfa) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, migraine headaches from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and contrast media allergy (lodine dye) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication included propranolol (PROPRANOLOL), vitamin d3 (VITAMIN D3) and ascorbic acid, zinc (VITAMIN C &#43; ZINC). The patient previously took avelox and experienced drug hypersensitivity. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. On 07Jan2021 at 14:30, the patient experienced metallic taste in mouth, cotton mouth and flush/tingly sensation in extremities (like when receiving IV contrast dye) after receiving vaccine for about an hour after. She did not tell anyone, just tried to work through it. The patient thought it was strange. She has a shellfish allergy/sensitivity, not sure if it was related. On 08Jan2021 (reported as the following day after vaccination), the patient experienced low grade fever, chills, malaise and body aches. Therapeutic measures taken included Advil and Tylenol. The clinical outcome of metallic taste in mouth, cotton mouth, flush/tingly sensation in extremities, low grade fever, chills, malaise and body aches was resolved on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

Lower back at kidney sites are so painful. Weakness. No energy to lift up arms or legs. Have difficult to get up and get out of bed to get medicine or food. So sleepy, maybe because Tylenol 500mg q4h to help for pain but reduce just little from 10 down to 8 for a short time enough to get out of bed to get something.  Ice pack at armpit, heat pat at lower back but just reduce the pain from 10 down to 9 only. No appetite. Eat lentil and rice porridge but indigestible and have to take Pepcid. All symptoms prolong until Friday 1/15/2021 around 1pm. I pushed myself hard to get up to drive to employee health for testing which I missed on Thursday due to unable to get up. After that the symptoms down to moderate that I able to report CDC. I wonder why 2 dose is so horrible to me.

I felt so bad that I missed 2 days of work and got a COVID test to be safe, as I am a nurse, results were negative and employer was made aware of reaction.

The left arm felt like battery acid, hurt super bad. Felt like an outer body experience. Was given Benadryl.  Was having a problem clearing her throat. Felt weird by her bellybutton, felt like she had on a corset on. Rash developed at sternum and bellybutton. Went over to her ER at work. The knee to the hip felt like she had cement on them. Her tongue started to swell. She was wheeled up to tramum2. She blackout at some point.  Her body was doing one thing and her mind another. She had EpiPen stat.  Right was twitching like Parkinson&#39;s.  After 1 1/2 she started feeling a little better. 69/43 bp recorded. The next few days she felt like she had Mono.

A 53-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3249), intramuscular in left arm on 14Jan2021 12:00 at a single dose to prevent COVID-19. Medical history included shingles recently and was not given any medicine for that and breast cancer when she was 29 so she can&#39;t have shots on her right side. There were no concomitant medications.  On 15Jan2021 05:00, she went to the bathroom and everything went black. When her eyesight did come back after a while, she was sweating badly and had the chills.  As soon as her husband helped her get back to bed, she started sweating really bed. Her nightclothes were soaked, it wasn&#39;t like a normal sweat. She also got the cold chills. She got the cold chills right after she had the experience with her eyesight. She was just kind of achy. However, the sweating, chills, and achiness are all listed on the form she has. She isn&#39;t really worried about that. The patient was more concerned about the fact she couldn&#39;t see anything. Caller wanted to know if losing her eyesight is a side effect of the vaccine. She confirmed her eyesight came back. The outcome of the event losing her eyesight was recovered while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

In regards to the first dose, she only had a severe sore arm and couldn&#39;t elevate the arm but this only lasted for 24 hours and then she didn&#39;t have any soreness. She received the second dose on 13Jan2021 and experienced mild fever, chills, anorexia, headache, and myalgia. Her supervisor asked her to test positive for covid however she is wondering if she could get a false positive since it is still within 72 hours after vaccination. Patient asked if after vaccination do they not check for antibodies to make sure the vaccine is working. The patient reporting on COVID and who stated she got her second dose on Wednesday (13Jan2021) and who stated she has some questions about side effects and getting tested after vaccination. It was explained that she has had fevers, chills, headache, and discomfort in her chest (Jan2021). She was told to get a test by her job but wondered if she will test positive since it has been less than 72 hours since getting the vaccine. She got the second shot around 7:50pm or 8pm. At midnight she woke up with chills, mild fever, and severe muscle pain. Then she woke up in the morning early with a headache, severe muscle pain, it was very hard to make it.  She had severe anorexia, she was so hungry she ate a little and went back to bed. Then she only woke up for lunch and ate something. At that time her fever was gone. She went back to bed but at 8pm she woke up and still had muscle pain. She had a very difficult time yesterday. In the night she woke up with leg pain, muscle pain. The patient explained she felt better today so she went to work and spoke to her supervisor who told her it was better to take a test for COVID. It was mentioned she looked pale and it was better for her to have a test just in case. The patient reported that she knows a bit about vaccines and the proteins and RNA. Since it has been less than 72 hours since she had the second dose, would she test positive if she had a COVID test. No treatment after the doses. Patient states she has no had any testing done at this point. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of event so hungry. The event fever recovered on an unspecified date in Jan2021. The outcome of the events chills, anorexia, headache, discomfort in her chest and myalgia/muscle pain, leg pain, looked pale, and was so hungry was unknown.

She was tested for covid post vaccination through nasal swab on 20Jan2021 with pending result.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of chest tightness, wheezing, throat swelling, tongue tingling and lip numbness  due to temporal relationship.  However,  the chest tightness, wheezing may possibly be associated with the patient&#39;s history of asthma. There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Fever began on 24th around 10 with chills. Took Tylenol for low grade fever about 12:30 pm. Subsided for 6 hours and then 6:30 that evening it returned at 100.7. Again 6 hours later, fever was 100.4.  Christmas day, still had fever around 100. Then again that afternoon. Lymph node swelling underneath the arm. The site of the injection I had a large knot. Very swollen, small bruise, hot, and red. No streaking or red lines. Lymph node underneath the arm was about the size of a ping pong. I did not want to go to the ER. I called the nurse line and was triaged over the phone. I was instructed to take BP and pulse and gave numbers over the phone. BP was a little elevated, but nothing to extreme. I pretty much stayed laying down. It sucked the life out of me. I used hot compress and cold compress on site of the injection. It was late Saturday evening when I decided to see a change in the size of the lymph node. By Sunday, the 27th, there was no fever. Not even on Saturday. By Sunday, the lymph node had subsided as well.  I did get a headache, but it was like a nagging headache. My left shoulder in the muscle area towards the neck area, I had soreness.

Severe dizziness, heavy headedness , nausea and vomiting and a horrible headache.  My husband had to physically muscle me back to my car. He wanted to take me to the ER and I would not let him because of the waiting room is full of COVID positive patients.  I threw up along the way home and multiple times to the point I had drive heaves.  I am a Registered Nurse and felt the symptoms I were experiencing were Vertigo.  I had one bout with Vertigo in 2015 and it was extreme.  I had Meclizine on hand and and took one tablet and slept.  The severity of this was so bad I could not walk unassisted or sit up without falling over. After 6 hours of sleeping I got up, dizziness continued, and vision a little off.  I still do not feel 100% I have had a headache since.  It never dawned on me this could be from the vaccine I had taken a week before.

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via intramuscular on 19Dec2020 15:45 on left deltoid at a single dose for prevention as frontline health worker at hospital (COVID-19 immunisation). The patient donated blood on 18th and no antibodies were present then. The patient was a former smoker and quit 2 or 3 years ago. Patient diagnosed Osteoporosis in 2015, benign heart arrhythmia in 2005. The patient took 70 mg alendronate sodium (FOSAMAX) once weekly and just a regular OTC daily multivitamin. Caller reported she was having the covid vaccine on 19Dec2020 and began having fever, night sweats, loss of taste and smell and then tested positive for covid. The patient received the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine through work on 19Dec2020. She received it at 3:45 pm and should have taken temperature before, but she was afebrile the day before because she donated blood. At 7pm, she had slight temp 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit and by 10:30, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit and she still felt fine. She was surprised that it was that. She woke up at 2:30 am on 20Dec2020 and took her temperature and it was 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. She took 2 Tylenol and went back to bed and felt fine. By morning it was 99 degrees Fahrenheit and then 98 degrees Fahrenheit a little later. She has been afebrile since then. She was a little tired because she gave blood and though it was related. She does not know if it was a side effect or not. It was not significant tiredness and was just not having energy in the evening of 19Dec2020. She also had soreness at injection site that night after 22:00 and the next day. It did not bother her until she woke up in the middle of night, and she noticed her left arm was sore. She received the vaccine at 3:45pm and started with low grade fever at 6:30 pm, earlier stated at 7:00 pm. There was no prescriber. She tested for COVID (PCR) on Saturday, 26Dec2020 at 14:50and it came back positive 28Dec2020 18:45. At 10pm on 19Dec2020, her temperature was 101 degrees Fahrenheit. If she had not been monitoring her temperature, she would not have known. She has been Afebrile since morning of 20Dec2020. Tiredness she related to giving blood and the holidays. She was a little stressed about the holidays and running around. It was very mild. Soreness at injection site was during the night after 10pm when she went to bed. On Wednesday, 23Dec2020, she woke up congested, sniffly, sneezy, with a runny nose. This persisted through Wednesday night. Her sense of taste was off. She had no problem with that on Tuesday. She had some horrible smell at work she recalled, so she knew her sense of smell was fine. On Thursday, 24Dec2020, she had no sense of taste or smell. She could not smell a pine candle. She was congested on Thursday and called employee health on 24Dec2020. This both improved and persisted. She is still congested but it has improved. She has never had a complete loss of sense of taste or smell before. Mild cough started yesterday morning. On the night of 20Dec2020, and 21Dec2020, she developed night sweats. She had not had any night sweats before this since menopause and she woke up really wet. The patient was not hospitalized and not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required. She did not know if she was exposed on the day of the vaccine or if a couple of days later if the fever is from the vaccine. She stated what are the chances she goes 10 months and is super careful and then gets the vaccine and test positive. The patient did not display clinical signs at rest indicative of sever systemic illness. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen nor receive mechanical ventilation. No Multiorgan failure. The patient did not receive any additional therapies for COVID- 19. No initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. Not any preexisting diseases worsen during the SARS-CoV2 infection. She would like to know if there is a chance of false positive for this. It would just be her luck to be 10 months and not getting it. She has not gone anywhere without her N95 and then gets the vaccine and gets COVD. She wears mask and face shield at work always. She also wanted to know if she should get the second dose. The outcome of the event slight temperature was recovered on 20Dec2020 and the other event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this patient cannot be completely excluded.

A 54-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (lot number EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration at left deltoid on 30Dec2020 14:28 at the 54 years old at 0.3 mL single for where she works she was exposed to patients who need rehab that were exposed and getting COVID.  The patient medical history included Primary Essential Tremors and ongoing (had these for about 10-11 years. Her mother and grandmother also had them. Normally they were very fine, small tremors that people didn&#39;t notice. She can hold and turn her head and hide it) and Sulfa drug allergy (would get shortness of breath). The concomitant product was none. The patient previously took flu vaccine and experienced preservative made neck twitch and joint sores. Yesterday the patient got the COVID Vaccine and had a pretty significant adverse event. She was calling to report it and to see if she should get the second dose of the vaccine. The patient was also a licensed speech pathologist. She received the vaccine yesterday at 2:28 PM. She was allergic to Sulfa drugs and would get shortness of breath, so they wanted her to wait 30 minutes for monitoring. She was feeling giddy on 30Dec2020, but she ran into a friend that she had not seen before quarantine, so they were talking. It was exciting. After her 30 minutes she went to her car and felt a little funny. She thought she was hungry so she ate half a banana and had some water. She had an appointment to get to so she started to drive off, and by the time she got to the interstate she was feeling funny. She got on her left side, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face on 30Dec2020. This was like the precursor. Then on 30Dec2020 her face started to go numb. It felt like a dental block you would get with Lidocaine. It went from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips. It was midline on the left side. She was breathing fine. She was trying to figure out if she should pull over or call(Number), but her airway did not close up. Her upper esophageal sphincter got tight and felt funny like she was going to throw up. She drove to the hospital close to her house which is affiliated with where she got the vaccine. She normally had primary tremors, small to where people do not notice. But her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs on 30Dec2020. She looked like a bobble head. But she could still breath. They took her right in and they did an EKG to make sure it was not her heart. Her blood pressure was up on 30Dec2020, she assumes for being stressed. They monitored her. They gave her Pepcid and Benadryl. She did not want any nausea medications. She stayed for about 2 hours and slept some from the Benadryl. Her face slowly became less numb. The numbness went away started from her lips and outward to her check and temple area. Then it just felt funny. When she touched it, which she never lost sensation, it was like, whose face is this? It was strange. She is not numb anymore. It took a while for it to go away, and it still felt weird. When she woke up this morning it was completely gone. She had recovered completely from all of these things. The only thing she has now was some transient nausea. It was very mild. It comes and goes. It had improved. She had not taken anything for it.  The events Feeling funny, her face started to go numb, upper esophageal sphincter got tight, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Her whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, were all assessed as Medically significant. The outcome of the event Nausea was recovering, the events Felt giddy, blood pressure was up, Stress was recovered on 31Dec2020, the other events were recovered on 30Dec2020.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that the events Feeling funny, a cold spike feeling up her shoulder and neck and up to her face, Face started to go numb from her temple area, below her eye all the way to her lips, upper esophageal sphincter got tight , whole body was shaking- her head, hands, and legs, Nausea, were related to the product BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At night I felt fatigue and palpitations and could not sleep. Next morning the palpitations and fatigue went away but I start with a rash and very itchy and noticed my face swelling up. I took some prednisone I had home and Benadryl and went to the ER. They monitored me and medicated me and told me to keep with the Benadryl. On the 24th I started with the rash and on the 26th no more rash. My second dose is scheduled on the 13th and I will see my PCP on the 12th to decide if I should have the second dose. I am not allergic to anything and thought I would die on 12/24. I was swelling up in less than a minute after I woke up it was awful. I also have a consultation with an allergist on Tuesday  before the vaccine.

                                                10days after receiving vaccine developed an anaphylactic allergy after eating shellfish which I was never allergic to. I developed a red itchy rash over the entire body with throat tightening. Went to ER where I was treated with H1 H2 blockers steroids. After being treated and observed for a few hours I re developed the rash and symptoms again requiring further treatment and observation.

A 54-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot EL0140) intramuscular on 31Dec2020 16:00 at a single dose on left arm for Covid-19 prophylaxis. Medical history included rheumatoid arthritis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient wanted to know if she could receive the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine if she presented the following side effects with the first shot: feeling tired/tiredness on 02Jan2021; having no energy on 03Jan2021; muscle pain, joint pain, and flu like symptoms/feeling like she has the flu, on 04Jan2021. She went to work on Monday and has taken the last couple of days off because she did not feel good on Jan2021. She did have rheumatoid arthritis, but it was different and has not been like this. She went to the doctor on Monday after she got off of work and thought at first maybe she had a UTI; treated herself with AZO, but had a urinalysis that was negative on an unspecified date. She was told some of the pain in her back might have been a kidney stone on Jan2021 because they found crystals in her urine on 04Jan2021, but she did not know about that. She noticed having no energy on Sunday. She wanted to know if it was recommended that she get the second vaccine since she was having side effects. The events required a visit to physician office and did not require a visit to Emergency Room. Prior vaccinations within 4 weeks was noted as none. Family medical history relevant to the events (AE) was noted as none.The outcome of the events of feeling tired/tiredness was not recovered; of having no energy, muscle pain, joint pain, flu like symptoms/feeling like she has the flu was recovering; of the rest of events was unknown.

                                                She was wiped out the next day with aches and pains still.; tired; brain fog; started to get cold; shake/her hands were shaking so hard; they took her temperature and it was 100/her fever went to 101/temperature had gone to 102.6; heart rate was elevated at 100/heart rate was 110/heart rate went to the high 120s; headache; backache; nauseated; chest was hurting; The initial case was missing the following minimum criteria: Invalid for unspecified adverse event. Upon receipt of follow-up information on 08Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 54-year-old female patient received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot# EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration in deltoid left on 29Dec2020 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing sleep apnoea (diagnosed about 3-4 years ago, wear her CPAP religiously), Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, and chronic low vitamin d (lack of sunlight). Concomitant medication included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) from 2016 and ongoing for Hashimoto&#39;s hypothyroid, ergocalciferol (VIT D) from 2018 for chronic low vitamin d; lack of sunlight (She did not take it religiously, but was supposed to take it everyday). At 10:30 AM (29Dec2020), she started to get cold and shake. She thought that this was insane and it was in her head. It became so severe she could not use her computer her hands were shaking so hard. She went back up to where they were giving vaccines, they took her temperature and it was 100. It had been normal the morning before she got the vaccine. Her heart rate was elevated at 100. They put a blanket on her and said they wanted to watch her for 15 minutes. In that time her fever went to 101 and her heart rate was 110. They took her to the ER. She was there for 5 hours. Her heart rate went to the high 120s. They did a 12 lead EKG. Her temperature had gone to 102.6, which was the highest. They gave her a liter of Normal Saline. She also had a headache, backache, and felt nauseated. The liter of fluid helped, no doubt. She was not admitted. She was wiped out the next day (30Dec2020) with aches and pains still. Their concern was they said they did not give her epinephrine because her heart was too high. She had no breathing issues. Just extreme cold. At one point she had woke up in the ER (29 or 30Dec2020) and her chest was hurting, she knows from her heart rate being too fast. She was so cold. She had on 6 blankets. The next day (30Dec2020) she still had the aches and pains, she was tired, and had brain fog. It all went away on 30Dec2020. She had nothing after that. What scared her was the heart rhythm. The ER doctor says its not great, but felt that getting the second dose was better than her having COVID. The Electrophysiologist she saw, said she was unsure if she should get the second dose. The hospital said that for this next dose, they would give her the injection, wait 15 minutes, then send her home, expecting that she would have the same thing happen. When after the first dose, she was in the ER on a 12 lead EKG with an intravenous (IV). She had no arm pain the whole time. The reporter assessed all events related. She felt fine prior, walking in to get the vaccine. But she was much better the next day and recovered completely. She was just worried about the second dose. The outcome of events was recovered on 30Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I started to drive home.  It felt like a huge cold railroad spike was being driven up the top of my shoulder to my neck, it was a cold sensation anteriorly and posteriorly on my neck.  Then my face (left side) started to go numb, it started just about the top of my left ear and went all the way to my lips. It stopped midline.  It felt like a dental block.  I could still swallow and breathe.  I started shaking, felt nausea, my upper esophageal sphincter started to spasm.  I kept checking my tongue and airway to see if I should pull over and call 911.  I drove to the ER.  My left side of face was numb, I was trembling, tremoring.  They gave me small dose of IV Bendadryl (12.5 mg) and Pepcid, I slowly started to feel better and the feeling came back to my face moving from midline lip to cheek.  It still felt &#34;funny&#34; but much better.  I was in the ER for around 2 hours. I have had more tremoring since my vaccine in my neck and hand (I do have primary essential tremors but it is tremoring much more now) and more neck pain (could be due to the increased tremors)

On day 6 post injection, with bagging up a bag of garbage (bending over and picking things up with a spilt can) I had to sit down I was that SOB. HR 130 on pulse ox - O2 sat. 94-95.  Day 7 post injection - ER work up for PE - negative, chf evaluation - negative. no pneumonia or cardiomegaly on CTA. CBC all w/in normal limits except on diff - lymph 0.5 above normal range only. CMP ok as well. BMP and trops normal. Day 9 diffuse itchy rash has developed, even worse now on day 10. Raised, blanching, papules - no pustules/vesicles noted. Trunk presentation spreading to extremities.  leg signifiant more populated than arms. Rash now on tops and bottoms of feet.  Minimal spots on dorsal hands and none on palms. Extremely itchy.   &#43; Celiac patient (Dx- genetically 7-8 years ago, symptoms for over 10) and &#43; Hashimotos patient (29 years). No recent gluten exposure resulting in GI response. (I can get bowel incontinence with cross contamination. ) I&#39;m taking Synthroid as prescribed.  Since I&#39;m in the CD8 peak days (9-11)- can this just be some type of autoimmune storm since it was a viral vaccine? No history of any problems with my yearly influenza vaccine.

                                                On Sunday, January 17, 2021 I started having severe joint pain in my wrists, elbows, knees, hips and shoulders. Along with aching all over. Over the course of the day, I started to feel bad. Then on Monday January 18, 2021, in addition, to the joint pain, I started feeling disoriented, dizzy like spells of vertigo.  I went to my PCP who did lab work and all was normal. He said it muse be delayed reaction to the vaccine. Later in the day, I was having difficulty putting words together and more dizzy and very lethargic. I laid down and slept until the next morning. (Tuesday 1/19/21) On Tuesday 1/19/21, they symptoms were improved but still had some dizziness. On Wednesday 1/20/21, the symptoms have improved except for an occasional dizzy spell.

There was no twitch the a muscular contraction that left me unable to walk properly (the left side seem to be the tightest side of by body) .   I also had bilateral jaw pain  (not sure if its was because I was in so much pain in the legs that I was clenching my teeth) I also  had slight numbness on by left face and by the evening I had redness on my left cheek but it went away.   My face still has a bit of muscle sensitivity (tingling sensation) near the mouth and jaw.

Felt like i was going to die and my heart was going to jump out of my chest. In emergency room, they did an ekg and chest X-ray which were normal. They did some blood work. My potassium was very low ? 3.3. My TSH was 0.05; glucose 108;auto absol basos 0.1. Other results were normal. They told me the reaction was due to my low potassium and TSH levels. ER doctor recommended to change my levothyroxine dose with my pcp. Was in ER from approximately 1 pm - 6 pm on 1/7/21. They had me drink potassium and sent me home. Some symptoms subsided but still felt weak and dizzy when I left.

My body aches and nausea lasted until 02/20/2021. In the evening of 02/20/2021 I noticed about 10 little red bumps in various places on my body. (2 on left arm, one on back neck in hairline, two on upper back,  one on chest, two on left leg, one on lower back and one on left buttock.  Today is 02/22/2021 and I am still feeling fatigued.

                                                I had the vaccine on Wednesday and Friday morning i woke up with a headache; feeling hot and clamy; feeling hot and clamy; nausios; i could not breathe; It was like a really bad asthma attack; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient).   A 54-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EN6208), via an unspecified route of administration i as single dose in arm left on 10Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included known allergy to penicillin. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has not received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 12Mar2021 04:30 morning the patient experienced woke up with a headache, feeling hot and clamy, nausios. She took Iboprofin and was fine. On 12Mar2021 night she went to bed about 10 pm and woke up from a sound sleep about 12:30 am she could not breathe. It was like a really bad asthma attack which she have never had like that. It took a while to try to breath thru her nose but finally she was able to and took a nebulizer treatment with Abutero.

I had already left the drive-thru vaccination clinic and was driving to the hospital emergency room where I work. I informed my colleagues of my symptoms and was treated for anaphylaxis with IV diphenhydramine and famotidine over several hours. I was given a prescription for a prednisone taper for the next 6 days.

When the drink did not help she was given 12.5mg of diphenhydramine at 4:57pm. It was recommended and offered for her to take 25mg of diphenhydramine but patient stated it made her too drowsy. After a few minutes, the patient stated it felt like her throat was tightening so she was given the other 12.5mg of diphenhydramine given at 5:03pm. She stated her heart was racing and her head was pounding. Her blood pressure was 164/72 and pulse 117. She stated her chest was feeling tight and at 5:11 an EpiPen was administered and call to 911.

                                                Vaccine administered at 11:15 AM.  At 12:00 pm the top of my head became very hot, my face felt hot and red with raised rash, my scalp became very itchy, my heart felt like it was beating out of my chest and I had pounding in both ears.  My bilateral forearms began to itch and then developed hives.  I notified my Supervisor that I was having a reaction.  I was checked in to ER (where I am an RN).  My blood pressure was elevated 180&#39;s systolic and my heart rate was 180BPM and short of breath.  An IV was started and I was given Normal Saline Bolus, Solu-medrol 125MG and Benadryl 25MG IV.  Prior to medications, my throat felt itchy and &#34;tight&#34; but resolved once medication given.  The itching and hives continued to spread to my upper back, neck, bilateral feet and behind my bilateral knees.  After approximately 1 1/2 hrs itching and hives continued then I was given Pepcid IV and Benadryl 25mg PO which after 40 minutes my itching and hives resolved.  I was later discharged home with a prescription of Methylprednisolone 4MG dose pack.  Symptoms resolved until approximately 1:30 am on 5/7/2021 when I awoke to pounding in my ears and the feeling once again my heart was beating out of my chest.  My heart rate was 132BPM, I became hot and diaphoretic,  short of breath.  My scalp felt it was on fire and then I broke out in hives.  I immediately took Prednisone, benadryl and pepcid.  I took a cool shower, got dressed and drove to the hospital down the road and sat in the parking lot just in case my throat became itchy and tight (which it did not).  The hives and itching began to resolve after an hour.  My heart rate went back to 67BPM and shortness of breath resolved as well.  I called Employee Health at hospital and made a report of symptoms.

The lymph node was about the size of a large gumball.  The next day I started having pain in the lymph nodes of my arm pit on the right side.  The symptoms are still present six days later and I now have some swollen and tender lymph nodes in the antecubital area of the same arm.  I am scheduled to get my second dose on 1/21/21.  I have not had any other side affects that I know of other than feeling a little tired and mild headache on and off but that didn&#39;t seem unusual for me.  The lymph node in my neck seems to be getting a little smaller as of today 1/13/21.

A 55-year-old female patient received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 06Jan2021 14:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included mild hypertension and arthritis. The patient was not pregnant. No Covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included estradiol, norethisterone acetate (COMBIPATCH), meloxicam, propanol. The patient previously received 1st dose of BNT162B2 in left arm on 17Dec2020 15:45 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient experienced egg sized lymphadenopathy under right arm 36 hours after 2D injection (08Jan2021 03:00), after flu symptoms of muscle and joint aches, arm pain and swelling at 20 hours (07Jan2021 12:00). No treatment received for the events. The outcome of events was not recovered. This case was reported as non-serious.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and the drug&#39;s known safety profile, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of lymphadenopathy. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I began to experience a dry throat about 10 minutes after injection - I attributed it to needing a drink. My throat then felt a bit warm and I thought this was due to thirst as well. I left the monitoring area. I was walking to my vehicle and began to feel more of a warm sensation in my throat and not into my upper chest. About 5 minutes after this took place my face became flush and began tingling and feeling sunburned and tight - I looked in the mirror and my cheeks and nose and chin were red and felt extremely warm - I did not have facial swelling that i noticed buy my face felt tingly and like it was sunburned - my eye felt puffy but did not look puffy enough to notice in the mirror. Approximately 30-35 minutes after the immunization,  I took 50mg of Benadryl and 1300mg of Tylenol. I felt my symptoms begin to improve  about 25-30 minutes after taking the medication - my throat and chest were not as warm.  the facial flushing lasted about an hour or hour and a half.   The morning after my immunization I did have a scratchy throat - I did not take any further medication - by the afternoon - this is almost gone - still just a little scratchy.

Came to report to me (lead RPh for clinic) at 11:50am. I spoke with another staff member to get patient 50mg of benadryl. While I waited for the medicine, I inspected the patients arm, face and inside the mouth. No redness, swelling, hives or other signs/symptoms of allergic reaction. Arm looked normal, no discoloration. Same with face and inside mouth. Patient took 50mg Benadryl at 12pm. Patient also stated having sinus issues currently (before vaccination) and has had off/on reactions with flu shot and other vaccines, mainly itching in the arm that was injected and swelling at the injection site (grapefruit size). Patient reported feeling itchiness gone at 12:10pm but still having some numb tongue. By 12:23pm, patient reported feeling completely better and no more numbness in the tongue.

                                                I got the vaccine at 1:30pm at vaccine clinic and waited the mandatory 15 minutes in clinic&#39;s observation area.  After release I went to my car and started to drive home.  At the 25 minute mark post vaccine (1:55pm)  I felt numbness and tingling of cheeks and lips (no swelling and no difficulty breathing).  I drove the nearby adult hospital, parked on a side street to wait and see if anything got worse.  After 10 minutes symptoms subsided and I continued home.  At the 50 minute mark post vaccine (2:20) I felt numbness and tingling of my right arm which subsided after 10 minutes.  No further side effects.

                                                The day after vaccine I started to have a burning, stinging skin reaction on right side of torso. Thinking it was hives, I applied cortisone cream and took Zyrtec. This continued through following week. I went to my personal physician and was diagnosed with shingles though I never had any outward rash or blisters.  Just skin sensitivity . I was prescribed  triamcinolone acetonide cream 0.5% which I have been applying twice daily. I have not had an outbreak but have had minimal internal pain that feels like strained or pulled muscle in the same area.

The patient&#39;s medical history included urinary tract infection (UTI) from 06Jan2021 and ongoing. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), in the left upper arm with no issues. At first, she just had a sore arm on 08Jan2021. Then this morning, on 13Jan2021, she was having chills, enlarged lymph nodes, body aches in her back and shoulders, and a fever of 99.6. It is low grade but does not take much. She has been checking her temperature every 4 hours and it is not any different. She was taking paracetamol (TYLENOL) for a few days to ward anything off. Today (13Jan2021), she laid off the paracetamol to see if she really did have a fever. She did not want to mask it. So, she is taking paracetamol for that off and on. She talked to one person who said the symptoms should last 1-2 days. Then another person said they could last up to a week. She hopes that it is related to the vaccine. She will be mad if she gets COVID after doing all of this. Outcome of the sore arm was recovered on 09Jan2021 and of the remaining events was not recovered.

Denied ocular pain, EOMI,  conjunctive is not infected.  Noted slight particles in the corners of her eye but it was not crusting.  Had used hydrocortisone cream on the area but was advised by doctor to stop.  Dr encouraged cold compresses, increased fluid intake and avoid salt/caffeine.

Numbness, tingling feeling from R mid cheek moving toward R ear. Swelling of the face at this site as well. Paresthesia feeling, abnormal sensations at this same area of the face. These issues continues even to today. Initially, I experienced a H/A on the R sided above my eye which has not been occurring lately. On 1/8/21 I was seen by the NP at and was dx. with Bell?s Palsy. The NP noticed that when I initially speak my mouth doesn?t move properly, but once I get my words started then my mouth moves properly. My smile is noticed to be abnormal. The NP then sent me to ER for evaluation with the dx. Of Bell?s Palsy and because of another potential medical condition there?s a high risk for a stroke. A CT scan and blood work were obtained. A f/u script for a MRI of the brain has been ordered as well. Discharge paperwork states: Bell?s Palsy. Currently, I am taking a tapering dose of Prednisone and Valtrex as prescribed.

Eyes felt swollen then began to feel nauseous (tried to vomit, but no food came up) and then a runny nose  (clear fluid).   I took another Claritin 10mg and also Zofran 8mg ODT which resolved the nausea.  Had to blow my nose 2 times.   Went to sleep with my Epipen at bedside but didnt have to use it.   Woke up at 815am and only symptom remaining was arm soreness.   Felt like my normal self and played 3 hrs of tennis.  Arm soreness at injection site worsened during the day.  By 72 hrs post-injection, arm soreness resolved.

I went to work on 12/28 but woke up 12/29 with a low grade fever and felt like my throat was on fire.   so on the 29th I went and got a Strep and flu test which were negative.  I was feeling so bad so on the 6th of Jan do I went to the stand alone ER and got a chest xray and CT scan which revealed I did have pnemonia.  I went back home  but was feeling worse and was taken to and admitted in hospital for 2 days.  Initially I was admitted into the COVID unit but never was diagnosed COVID positive so I was moved off the COVID unit.  I was given albuterol pills to try to help with the symptoms but didnt work causing me to have to be admitted and was given several doses of steorid and other antibioics and had to use O2 at night because my stats kept falling.

                                                From the evening of the day I have received the vaccination, my left arm started to feel dull continuous pressure pain, progressed stronger and stronger as the time goes.  No treatment given.  Following day, the pain was worse and stayed same.  The IM insertion site was also painful to touch or pressure.  Then afternoon of the same day, I started nausea, light headache, dizziness, and occasionally chills  as well as occasional dry cough accompanied by itchy throat or without itchy throat.  At this point, I took Advil 200mg 1 tab around 3pm.  The muscle pain on my left arm and headache is eased but other symptoms stayed same at this time, 4:30pm.

A 56-Year-old female consumer (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EJ1686), via unspecified route at left upper arm on 12Jan2021 about 9:15am at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Vaccination facility type was hospital. Medical history and concomitant drugs were not reported. Weight: 175-180 lbs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect vaccine. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. Past drug included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) been using the product more than 10 years and never had a problem with it, she didn&#39;t think that was related to her experience. Patient received first vaccine yesterday 12Jan2021. 45 minutes after receiving vaccine (12Jan2021 10 AM), she developed hot flashes in sternum (flushing sensation in her sternum or upper chest area. It was like when she had a dye injected), anxiety, dizziness/ light headedness, muscle weakness, significant dissociation, depersonalization, shakey, mild nausea, arm pain. The patient explained that this was why she was in the MRI scanner (Jan2021). This came a couple of times yesterday and had not been experienced this today (13Jan2021). It (dizziness) was ongoing and sporadic and had happened couple times yesterday and today. There were a few hours yesterday 12Jan2021 where she felt like herself but then it all started again last night. The patient reported feeling disassociated from her body, this was within about 20 minutes of the flushing and went in and out of being more or less alarming. She stated she felt disconnecting from where she was and space she was in, mentally. She knew where she was but could feel no connection to where she was or her body. The patient would touch her hand but couldn&#39;t feel her hands, it was like they weren&#39;t hers. This was during the half hour of the events occurring. She had mild nausea, this started not long after the flushing and it came and went a little bit but it was not too troublesome. The patient felt disconnect from her body and had shakiness like her lower leg feel shaky and weak and tingly. This happened on and off since the episodes started. The patient reported she slept great and had a few hours yesterday where she felt good. Her arm was tender, this might have been yesterday but she thought it was this morning and was only tender to touch. The hand on that same side was painful, but not unbearable, just uncomfortable. The patient apologized for being emotional and tearful. She felt completely overwhelmed. She couldn&#39;t believe that she put herself in this position and she was perfectly fine before the shot. She did contact her doctor. No AE required a visit to emergency room/ physician office. There had been no treatment, she didn&#39;t know what to do. She remarked she was not going back for the second dose. Outcome of event dizziness was not recovered, and the rest of events was unknown.

A 57-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (Lot: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on deltoid right on 22Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, hypothyroidism, and environmental allergies. Concomitant medications included amlodipine besilate (NORVASC) at 10 mg, daily for blood pressure high, and levothyroxine sodium (TIROSINT) at 112 mcg (ug) for hypothyroidism. Patient got Covid Vaccine on Tuesday (22Dec2020) night and was fine on Wednesday (23Dec2020). She expected the normal side effects like maybe a little fever like that but she believed she was having allergic reactions. It started from 24Dec2020 and she got a rash on all her chest and in abdomen and also just like itchiness feeling all over. So she took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and a PPI &#39;a cup of&#39; them on 24Dec2020 and she thought that she only had to do that one&#39;s today (25Dec2020) and the only thing she noticed when she got the shot (Covid Vaccine) they kept her there for like 15 minutes and her eyes got red and itch. She didn&#39;t scratch them but they felt like itchy and she never had that before. She never had a problem with the vaccine before. She didn&#39;t know if that was the true allergic reaction to the vaccines or if it just something she had internal allergies and she just didn&#39;t know what it was. But she was okay at the time of the report. She took some diphenhydramine hydrochloride a little while before and a PPI (unspecified medication). She was still itchy but it was not that bad and she seemed to be doing fine. Her arm was fine. She was not having any (unspecified), except sometimes. 24Dec2020 she had chills which she expected and she was all good but the side effects whatever happened that way was not the allergic portion. She tried to contact the doctor. The doctor just switched his clinic only for geriatric patients. She had to find another doctor. She knew a Doctor whom she could try and call and she actually went to the infectious disease physician and he said she should go to get the vaccine, now she was trying with that too. She got allergic to anything. Covid Shot was the only thing new that she had in her life but like she was not sure if it was triggered by something out like (unspecified) because she had always environmental allergies too. She didn&#39;t know because she was going to consult the Physician on Monday. She was just going to see the regular doctor. She was just seeing that first that anything because she knew it didn&#39;t happen very often but the Covid vaccine she just wanted to make report. She was going to the Physician on Monday because right now she thought she didn&#39;t know how long it lasted like. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EK5730, expiration date: Mar2021, NDC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm (also reported as upper shoulder) on 07Jan2021 at 11:30 30 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported she was feeling exhausted, freezing cold, slightly nauseous, and did &#34;not feel as zippy as she normally do&#34; on 08Jan2021. She wanted these effects recorded, and would like to know if they were normal, and would they happen to the same or higher intensity with the second dose. The patient further reported she had no adverse reaction on 07Jan2021 other than her arm hurting a little. Starting on 08Jan2021, she had felt exhausted like she could just lay down and go to sleep, freezing cold, and slightly nauseous. She had been reading and was sure or was guessing this was normal, but wanted to verify that. She was not running a fever as of yet. Every time she tried to get up, she just laid back down. She felt fairly decent when she woke up, these events started later at the time of the report on 08Jan2021. She would not say these events were life threatening, but the CDC patient vaccine record card said to call to report any adverse events. She was scheduled for a second dose on 28Jan2021 and at this time did not plan to change dosing unless event worsening would occur. The patient had the vaccination, because she was always coming into contact with people with COVID at work. The patient had no investigation assessment. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. The patient was recovering from the event &#34;arm hurting a little,&#34; she was not recovered from the events &#34;exhausted/exhausted like she could just lay down and go to sleep, freezing cold, and slightly nauseous,&#34; while the outcome of the event &#34;not feel as zippy as she normally do&#34; was unknown.

A 57-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/lot number: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 17Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunization; diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) and paracetamol (TYLENOL), both via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date at unknown dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included high blood pressure from 2008 and ongoing. Concomitant medication included amlodipine from 2017 and ongoing at 5 mg at night for high blood pressure, losartan from 2017 and ongoing at 12mg once in the morning for high blood pressure. Following her 1st dose of the COVID vaccine on 17Dec2020, the patient had throat tightening, metallic taste in her mouth. She was scheduled to have her 2nd dose today (07Jan2021) and would like to know what to do and if she was still covered 80% from the 1st dose of her COVID vaccine shot. When she got her first COVID shot 3 weeks ago she got a metallic taste in her mouth and her throat tightened up a little. Throat tightening happened right after she got the shot and lasted about less than 2 minutes. She also turned red when she got it. Then about 14 hours later, on the same day she got nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak. This lasted until about 20Dec2020 as well. She was supposed to get 2nd dose today (07Jan2021). Before her first shot she had taken paracetamol and hydrochloride prior. She also took both of those today (07Jan2021). But then she was reading through the paperwork and it says that a severe reaction includes tightening of the throat. She was not sure if what she had was truly a reaction or not. She did not have other allergies. She had many flu shots and never had any difficulty with those. She was a nurse, she wanted the second dose, but she was concerned about the throat tightening, and it getting worse with the second dose. She was unsure of seriousness. She figured that she would get aches and pains. Everyone else who got it said their arm hurt, but nothing else. She thought it was weird. She was just wired differently she guesses. The action taken in response to the events for paracetamol and hydrochloride was  unknown. The outcome of events throat tightening, turned red was recovered on 17Dec2020. The outcome of event metallic taste in her mouth, nausea, diarrhea, and was pretty weak was recovered on 20Dec2020.

                                                Approximately 4-6 hours post vaccine I experienced site soreness and felt my hands were stiff, felt swollen, especially the right. Within a few more hours my arm became heavy and I had some general muscular achiness. By approximately 11pm I had intense muscular pain on the back of my legs making it difficult to stand. It felt like I had been hit repeatedly with 2x4s. About that time my posterior ribcage hurt also. I couldn&#39;t sleep, turning frequently as my hips hurt. This is what I felt like when I had COVID. Intense pain.  At 0630 (1/14) I got out of bed and felt I was going to faint, was extremely nauseous (I did not vomit) and had a very bad, global headache. I had to lay down again. My temp was 100.1 orally. I could not go to work. I was able to take Tylenol. It helped the pain but two hours later my temp was 100.8. I could not get out of bed  until 6pm, I felt delirious when I tried.  I was able to go to work on 1/15. Of note, following my first dose of COVID vaccine (Pfizer BioNtech Lot #EH9899 on 12/23/20) I had site soreness, heaviness of my left arm, T of 99.5 same day (about 10-12 hours post vaccination), and mild body aches for about a day.

                                                I noticed pruritic erythematous papules on my right little finger as I woke up the next morning (6:00 am) after the vaccine. The affected area has increased in size (about 2.5 x 1 cm now), and the finger is slightly swollen, with pain in the proximal interphalangeal joint when pressure is applied. Two days ago (1/15/2021; 8 days after vaccination), a small pruritic purple papule (2-3 mm) appeared on my ring finger over the distal interphalangeal joint, same hand, and the area is slightly painful when pressure is applied; today, the papule measures 3 x 5 mm. Skin lesions in both fingers are on the dorsal surface. I will seek medical attention.

The patient reported that she received the first dose of the vaccine on 04Jan2021 and yesterday (11Jan2021) she tested positive for COVID-19. Patient would like to know if she should follow-up for the second dose of the vaccine on 25Jan2021. Patient mentioned that maybe she should follow up with the second dose. It was also reported that the patient wanted to know if the vaccine could have given her COVID-19 and tested positive. Patient further clarified it to be the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Patient mentioned she is a caregiver and received the vaccine on last Monday (04Jan2021). On Friday (08Jan2021), the patient started to notice she was getting headaches.

Patient also realized that the sun had been bothering her eyes as she was driving, it was some eye sensitivity going on. That night patient got home and was able to eat, but the next day on Saturday (09Jan2021), she did not have any sense of taste or smell. Patient had lost her sense of taste and smell. Patient realized this when she woke up at 6 am for coffee and could not taste or smell it. Patient was calling to find out if there was any way one could get Coronavirus only after the first shot and if she still needs to go and get her follow-up vaccine on 25Jan2021. Patient stated she forgot the name of her HCP. Patient also mentioned she has chest pressure. Patient noticed it about an hour ago, later stated it was like 11 something. It comes and goes.

Patient stated they are both quarantining since her husband was exposed too and has not had the shot yet. Patient&#39;s eyes were also hurting, but that is due to the headache.

A 57-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 at single dose (lot number: EJ1685) on Deltoid Left for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced a warm feeling in her chest like tingling; kind of short of breath, it went away like she said it was just breath it was like for couple of minutes and then it went away and then she was just fine till it&#39;s been long here honestly about 3 or 4 days later; got shot in her right arm but left hand start swelling up first a little bit and then her left arm start swelling up and it&#39;s just and then that&#39;s the base and then her right hand start very, very mild swelling in her right hand. The hospital think there as some clot or something weird but she did not and then that started going down after that it just started going down and went away and never had swelling since then but this was going to long but this was something weird happened to her. She got chills, She got fatigue. She had increased heart rate after that it started getting worse. She had Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, she had that always but it&#39;s been control. She walked 5 miles daily a day, she was in shape, she had lot since then, so it&#39;s been under control, she never had problem with it until after she got the shot, her heart rate was she had to add medication, she never have to add. She took metoprolol (Treatment) so she added that and she added more and that&#39;s thing get it under control and then she take herself back off because she felt like it was under control but she had GI problems since, now she was getting better now, still have some issue, did not feel good, off and on. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: good on 04Jan2021 (blood work to see if something was going on to her heart, because she had short breath, and everything was good), weight: 166 or 164, SARS Covid antibodies test IgM on 04Jan2021: positive. Treatment: Nurse stated, &#34;No, not now, I had a heart-rate monitor, it&#39;s what for see what is my heart rate, to locate and see what&#39;s going on.&#34; Outcome of left hand start swelling up first a little bit and then her left arm start swelling up/ her right hand start very, very mild swelling in her right hand was recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is not a reasonable possibility that event heart rate increased is related to BNT162B2.  The event is most likely due to underlying paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.

This was elaborated as follows: patient experienced one week following 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine patient developed bilateral feet, left worse than right, burning, itching sensation. the symptoms progressed up to her mid calves and to a slight extent. The events were considered medically significant. Details were as follows: The symptoms were quite intense and interfered with her life, requiring gabapentin prescription for control of neuropathic complaints. Patient denied any significant weakness, low back pain, neck pain, balance problems, dizziness, bowel or bladder involvement. Patient saw physician who performed workup for common associated etiologies of polyneuropathy, which were negative. Patient underwent EMG/NCS which were normal, and subsequently skin bx (skin biopsy) to rule out small fiber neuropathy (results pending). The patient further described the incident as a week after receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine, the patient experienced new onset bilateral feet burning that went into her upper legs, mid calves and to a slight extent in both hands. The burning was experienced more in the left foot than the right foot. Reports it was severe enough for the patient to reach out to her primary care provider. (PCP) to start Gabapentin for neuropathic pain. PCP ordered labs to rule out infection and other causes for neuropathy which all came back negative. Patient has no known underlying risk factors that would predispose her to neuropathy. Neurologist did an EMG which showed no evidence of neuropathy. The patient went into to the office, and she had a skin biopsy to rule out small fiber neuropathy. She does not have results to provide for the skin biopsy at this time, however, the neurologist feels if the skin biopsy is positive, there may be an association with the vaccine in regards to the burning pain the patient is experiencing. She is calling to ask if this is a reported side effect. Treatment was confirmed as gabapentin was prescribed by PCP, and the patient started on it a few days after the onset of the burning pain. Outcome was noted as it has not improved, and has not resolved. No  COVID tested post vaccination was noted. The outcome of the events was not recovered; the condition was persisting.  Causality for the events was noted as related.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a compatible temporal association contributory role of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) to the onset of events pruritus,  burning sensation, condition aggravated cannot be excluded.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after vaccination (during post vaccination observation), patient reported feeling ?off? and that her throat hurt. I was contacted via radio to aid with assessment.  Upon my arrival, patient reported that that she was experiencing slight difficulty swallowing, was feeling ?off? and felt ?like her head was in a fog?. Assessment of vitals revealed an intial vital signs of respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, pulse of 74 beats per minute, 97% oxygen saturation levels. Blood pressure was obtained prior to arrival and was reported as 121/74. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Clear S1 and S2 were present upon cardiac auscultation with no mumurs or gallops noted. Patient appeared slightly pale with a slightly hoarse voice. Patient did not have noticeable pharyngeal edema upon examination. Patiney had no increased work of breathing and was not using accessory Muscles for breathing. Patient was given a swallow test using bottled water and then solid food and demonstrated intact ability to swallow with no regurgitation, choking or drooling noted. Continuous oxygen saturation monitoring revealed 02 that never fell below 96%. Continuous pulse monitoring revealed a pulse that was between 74-79. Given the stability the vital signs, demonstrated ability to swallow and inappropriately labeled IM medication in emergency kit (ie three loose syringes were not drawn up by myself. Medications were labeled by hand with no expiration date, route or dose), I elected to give the patient 25 mg of oral diphenhydramine. Patient declined to seek emergency medical attention several times. Patient?s daughter was then called so that the patient could be driven home. Patient was advised to seek emergency medical attention if her symptoms worsened, she developed increased difficultly breathing or otherwise felt unwell. Advised to follow up with PCP within next 24 hours.

A 57-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: ON5318), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient has been having a lot of side effects. The patient experienced common weakness on 09Feb2021 which was expected, extreme burning in her lower extremities and hands but it was worse in her lower extremities which occurred 4-7 days after vaccination in Feb2021, orthostatic hypotension and dizziness on 12Feb2021, nerve pain 9 out of 10 in Feb2021 which has subsided as of 20Feb2021 or 21Feb2021, super weak, brain fog and sleepy on unknown date. As of 24Feb2021, patient still had orthostatic hypotension and weakness. Stated they have done a CBC on her and everything looks good, her basophils are a little elevated but it is nothing serious. The patient is concerned about the second dose, does not think patient is going to get it. Outcome of events weakness, orthostatic hypotension and dizziness was not recovered, events extreme burning in her lower extremities and hands and nerve pain 9 out of 10 was recovered in Feb2021. Outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal association between the reported event nerve pain which was 9 out of 10 according to the patient and the BNT162B2 COVID-19 vaccine cannot be excluded.

Speech clear, no stridor noted. Pt stated does have a significant allergy history and sees an allergist. Medicated with Benadryl 50 mg po and immediately to ED, registered right away, pt then c/o head and back itching, and taken into triage for assessment by triage nurse.   Per Hospital Note: Patient initially developed hives and itching with progression in symptoms to include shortness of breath and throat tightening. She reported feeling as though her tongue were swelling and having difficulty speaking and having difficulty swallowing. Concerns of impending loss of airway prompted administration of IV Solu-Medrol, Benadryl and 2 doses of intramuscular epinephrine which were unsuccessful and therefore emergent intubation was performed.   Patient apparently has had prior anaphylactoid reactions in the past including bee stings and shellfish.

A 58-year-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number= EH9899), intramuscular on 19Dec2020 07:00 at SINGLE DOSE at Left arm for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included breast cancer female and allergies to shell fish and Latex. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 30 minutes after receiving vaccine on 19Dec2020 07:30 am, patient reported &#39;heart racing, dizziness, flushing, burning pain in her chest, dizziness. tachycardia, nausea and throat tightness. Patient was taken to the ED where she received IV Benadryl and was observed for 4 hours. Patient was discharged home and symptoms subsided. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient was not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovered in Dec2020.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is a plausible temporal relationship between immunization and onset of allergic reaction in a subject with a positive medical history for allergy to food (shellfish); causality cannot be completely excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Flush; Itching; felt like she was going to wet herself; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 58-year-old female patient received the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730 and Expiration Date: unknown), intramuscularly in the upper left arm on 22Dec2020 at 08:48 at 58-years-old at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; which was received at a hospital. The patient stated the hospital had a line for employees to drive up and receive the vaccine, she was in her car when the vaccine was administered. Medical history included ongoing allergy to sulfates from an unknown date (diagnosed at least 20 years ago). The patient had an allergy to sulfates. The patient had a bad reaction to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) many years ago. The patient did not have the Lot and NDC numbers, or expiration date to provide. The patient stated the reaction was so bad she had to receive multiple injections because her throat was closing off and she had big hives. This occurred years ago. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (BACTRIM) and experienced bad reaction, throat was closing off and big hives from an unknown date to an unknown date. On 22Dec2020, the patient experienced: flush, itching, and felt like she was going to wet herself; all assessed as non-serious. The patient called about the COVID-19 vaccine. The patient was wondering if there was any sulfa in the vaccine. The patient had the vaccine on 22Dec2020, and she was fine for the first hour and then she became flush and started itching an hour later. The patient stated &#34; you know when you get a CT scan and the contrast makes you feel warm down there&#34;, states she got that same feeling where she felt flush and where she was warm down there and she felt like she was going to wet herself. The patient stated, &#34;the bladder feeling came on so harsh and fast.&#34; The patient took diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) for two days and she felt better. The patient later clarified that she recovered completely as of 25Dec2020. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of flush and itching. The clinical outcome of the events, flush and itching, was recovered on 22Dec2020. The clinical outcome of the event, felt like she was going to wet herself, was unknown. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as a suspect. There were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer suspect. The events did not require a visit to an emergency room or physician office.  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the suspect vaccine.  There were no adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations.  There were no relevant tests performed.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 01Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 58-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 also reported as Covid 19 vaccine; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 vaccination. Medical history included having something called Adult Still&#39;s which is bad Rheumatoid Arthritis. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that she got the vaccine and was experiencing sever cramps in her legs and thighs, and muscle joints pain. She mentioned on a scale of 1-10 it is 20. The patient also experienced flu like symptoms which were body ache and extremely tired. The patient reported that she called because she received her first Covid shot on 17Dec2020 and she was really sick from then, she was talking like super sick. In Dec2020, she had muscle cramps, headache, no fever but like she had the flu. She has something called Adult Still&#39;s which is bad Rheumatoid Arthritis, so it caused her to go into the flare but she was still sick. She was still feeling bad. She was still having muscle pains in her leg. The patient mentioned that she had to go to the emergency room because she could barely move her leg. They told her that it was a combination of Adult still&#39;s and her Covid 19 shot, so they gave her some medications. They gave her Lyrica 75 mg, twice a day and it messed me up that she couldn&#39;t even function. So, now she had to come home from work and now she was still having the leg cramps and just not feeling well so what can she do to feel myself better. The outcome of the event cramps in legs was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.  Information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

The mammogram showed that I had inflamed lymph nodes in my left breast, which is the same side on which I received the injection (left arm).  I had an ultrasound the same day.  The same radiologist read the mammogram and the ultrasound.  There were multiple axillary lymph nodes on the left side.

(No symptoms at all with first immunization) Symptoms of fatigue began approx. 12 hrs. late,  then fever after midnight, chills, body aches, severe headache, abd cramping, and extreme fatigue. Highest fever recorded was 101.8 the next day (Sunday) around  4pm.  Didn&#39;t take Tylenol or Motrin.  As of writing this (Monday 12:07 pm) my fever is gone but headache and extreme fatigue remain. Injection site still sore and today I notice I have a very swollen and painful lymph node left axilla opposite injection site.  I had to call in sick today and possible will tomorrow if the extreme fatigue and headache don&#39;t go away.

Tylenol was taken, which offered very little relief. 1/8/2021; I awoke with extreme fatigue, unable to sit up,  nausea, and diarrhea with stomach pain, headache, which wasn&#39;t unrelieved by 1000mgs of Tylenol, unable to raise R arm due to swelling and pain, aching and weakness all over body, joints, and muscles. It also caused a Fibromyalgia flare-up, which I wasn&#39;t experiencing prior to vaccine. It was 1/10/2021 before I was starting to feel better.

                                                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   I received the first Pfizer Vaccine (EH9899) on 12/19/20. A few days later, I felt like my head, on the side of my right ear, had a great deal of pressure in it and it felt &#34;funny &#34; but it did not really hurt. It was uncomfortable and distracting. I waited to see if it would go away. I noticed my hearing was decreased . On 01/06/20 when I woke up, my hearing was completely gone in my right ear. I could hear nothing out of that ear.  I had a noise in my head. Just a loud roaring noise. I had severe vertigo and could not walk across the room. I describe this as I felt like I was on a merry-go-round and someone was spinning me really fast. (continue)  Additional information for Item 18: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System,   continued:    I also experienced severe vomiting and could not stop. My husband took me to the doctor. Since I could not get in to my regular doctor that day, we went to an ear doctor I had visited a couple of years ago because that was the only person I could find to see me on short notice. I had regular hearing test in the past and my hearing was normal last time he checked it.  After doing a hearing test, he verified my Hearing was severely decreased in my right ear. I explained to him, I also feel &#34;foggy&#34; and I have problems concentrating, was having vertigo, and vomiting. I am not sure if that is because of the constant sound in my ear that distracts me but it is a definite problem and interferes with my work. I cannot concentrate. He started me on Steroids (Prednisone) 60 mg a day for 7 days, then 40 mg for 3 days, then 20 mg for three days, Antivert 12.5 mg three times a day as needed, and Zofran for the vomiting if I needed that.  I have not experienced anymore vomiting and the Vertigo has been very limited. Mostly when I lay down now instead of when I stand up.  My blood pressure has also been slightly elevated, but it could be from the Steroids.   I was scheduled to take the 2nd Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21. Since I was receiving the high doses of Steroids, I was concerned that the vaccine would not be effective or may interact with the steroids so I went to my family doctor 01/08/21, for a visit. He said he would check and let me know if it was contraindicated for me to take the Vaccine on high doses of steroids. When I did not hear from him, because I had to take the vaccine the next day, I called the Pharmacy and talked to someone there and they told me the agency was still recommending you take the Vaccine even if you are on the steroids. I received the second Pfizer Vaccine on 01/09/21.  My hearing is now coming and going but I can hardly hear anything out of that right ear. . There is a constant noise, like a roaring, in my head and I still have problems concentrating. I have had no more vomiting and my vertigo has hot been as severe but I have experienced some at times.   I reported to the Pharmacy the day I received my vaccine, 01/09/21, about the things I had experienced this since my first vaccine. They took my information and said they would call me but today is 01/12/21 and I have not heard from them yet so I thought I would go ahead and report this. I am concerned this was an adverse reaction to the vaccine. I return to the doctor 01/20/21 for a repeat hearing exam.   The Doctor expressed this condition could be a permanent and disabling  issue but currently being treated and will follow up with more testing.   I am also concerned about how the second vaccine affected me because I was receiving the high doses of Steroids at the time I received it.    I am sending this from a work email so if you reply, please reply to personal email.

Medical history included Pernicious anaemia from 2006 and ongoing, Hashimoto&#39;s disease ongoing, stated she was diagnosed with Hashimoto&#39;s disease in either 1994 or 1995. Psoriatic arthritis from Nov2020 and ongoing. Potassium low ongoing, reported she has had low potassium off and on for years. She said she can&#39;t remember when she didn&#39;t have low potassium.

She stated on the second day (03Jan2021) she had joint pain, felt yucky, had nausea, and chills. She said the next day (04Jan2021) she felt a little better, but still had chills. She said yesterday (05Jan2021) she thought she was feeling better, but by yesterday, clarified as late afternoon and evening, she crashed. She said she has a lot of autoimmune issues and immune deficiencies, saying she has pernicious anemia and Hashimoto&#39;s disease.  She said yesterday evening she experienced extreme body temperature issues. She said she was really sweaty, so much so, that she had sweat under her eyes. She said she would get really hot and had chills. She said she was feeling really bad and was feeling shaky inside. She said she thought it was important that she report what she was experiencing to Pfizer. She stated she has psoriatic arthritis, too. Reported after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on 02Jan2021, she had left upper shoulder pain. She clarified that she had a previous history of paralysis in her left trapezius muscle and had surgery in 1998 on her left shoulder. She said she had a weird feeling that went around where her scar was from the surgery on the back of her left shoulder. She said maybe the left shoulder pain had to do with how she held her left shoulder. She said on Monday, 04Jan2021, she had a little bit of pain in her left shoulder and by yesterday night, 05Jan2021, there was not much pain at all. Clarified her joint pain was in her ankles, wrists, hips, neck,  back, and knees. She said the joint pain felt like &#34;flu&#34; joint pain. She stated she normally has joint pain with the other issues she has, but this joint pain felt different. She said the joint pain she experienced after taking the COVID-19 Vaccine was all over her body. She said yesterday (05Jan2021) her joint pain felt so much better, but later in the afternoon she didn&#39;t feel right. She said she has pernicious anemia, and thought maybe she needs her B-12 shot. She said yesterday (05Jan2021) she experienced a lot more symptoms. She said she had numbness in her face, felt extremely exhausted, had a foggy feeling, and felt exasperated. She said the symptoms didn&#39;t start until late in the afternoon into the evening of 05Jan2021. She said she did not feel well and went to bed at 8:45PM, which is early for her. She said she did give herself a B-12 1mcg/ml shot intramuscularly yesterday. She provided the B-12 1mcg/ml NDC Number: 7006900510, Lot Number: C0495, and Expiration Date: Aug2022. She said the name (company name) was listed on the B-12 1mcg/ml packaging. She said she gives herself a B-12 shot every 10 days.  She said she still has some joint pain, but the joint pain is not like it was on 03Jan2021. She said she still has a tiny bit of heaviness in her joints with a constant throbbing pain, which is a different joint pain from her normal. Reported last night (05Jan2021) she didn&#39;t feel good at all. She said she felt horrible, and had to go to bed. She said she felt shaky inside all night, and still feels that way now.

A 58-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (Batch/lot number: EL0140), in Hospital, by intramuscular route in right upper arm on 23Dec2020 at 08:30, at 58-year-old of age, at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She didn&#39;t receive any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported that it has been 2 weeks since she received the COVID-19 Vaccine now and she still has a considerable amount of lymph node swelling and lymphedema in the right forearm side and the right upper arm. The nodes on the right side of her neck around the clavicle have been quite swollen for about 2 weeks. She has the list of side effects so she was not concerned, as this was listed but now she&#39;s not sure. When she got the vaccine she had the expected redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site (onset reported as 23Dec2020). On the evening of the 24Dec2020 she had an itchy scalp but she didn&#39;t see any rash and that only lasted a short time. On 29Dec2020 the patient had a significant swelling on the right side of the base of her neck near her clavicles that wrapped around to the posterior of her neck and was assessed as medically significant. She treated it by putting ice on it in the evening. On 30Dec2020 the swelling seemed to be slightly decreased but it is still a visible lump, the nodes are firm and there is swelling around those and it has not improved since the 30Dec2020. On 30Dec2020 she noticed a little cold blister or hive on the center of her lower lip and that was resolved by 03Jan2021, she did not have fever and did not feel sick, but her main problem is the swollen lymph nodes around base of neck around clavicle and it is considerably swollen there. The patient reported that last night (06Jan2021) it looked like her right arm was swollen, she thinks she is having lymphedema on the right arm, her right forearm is half an inch circumference larger than her left arm and was measured at her work. The patient reported she is seeing her new primary care doctor on 26Jan2021 and will follow up with the doctor. The patient wanted to know if she should get the second dose scheduled for the next week or should wait until the swelling resolves. Moreover the patient asked how long do the side effects usually last (specifically systemic side effects). The events &#34;redness, swelling and tenderness at injection site&#34; and &#34;slightly itchy scalp&#34; resolved on 25Dec2020, the event &#34;Cold blister on lip&#34; resolved on 03Jan2021. The event &#34;Swelling on the right side of the base of her neck near her clavicles&#34; had not resolved yet at the time of the report.  All the reported events were assessed as related to the COVID-19 Vaccine by the Primary Source Reporter (Method of assessment:Agency).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events swelling and lymphadenopathy cannot be excluded.

                                                I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive.; I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day; I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise; I was covered in sweat; vomited; I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F; sore; I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).   This 58-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular at single dose in the left arm on 09Jan2021 06:00 for Covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included atrial fibrillation on unknown date (1 episode), allergic to Keflex. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot  EJ1685 or FJ1685), intramuscular in the left arm on 22Dec2020 for Covid-19 immunisation.  On 10Jan2021 01:00 AM, the patient experienced: I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in i was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive (loss of consciousness) (medically significant), I had my 2nd vaccine at work early sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day (feeling abnormal), Iwoke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise (malaise), I was covered in sweat (hyperhidrosis), vomited (vomiting), I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F (pyrexia), sore (pain), I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response (seizure). No treatment required. The outcome of the events was recovered.   The events were described as follows: I am healthy RN with no active medical problems. I had my 2nd vaccine at work early Sat the 9th and felt increasingly worse all day, I expected this so was not alarmed and went to bed around 10pm. I woke up at midnight and felt extreme malaise and went to the bathroom in case I might vomit, etc. and I tried to have a BM. I began to pass out and yelled for my husband, he said when he came in I was sitting on the toilet with my head back, eyes rolling back not responsive. He yelled at me for about 10 seconds and I came to, I was covered in sweat. I asked him to walk me back to the bedroom where I again passed out, fell to the floor and hit the bed, then was unresponsive again for about 10 seconds then came to again and vomited. After this I felt completely relieved of my malaise. I checked my temp and it was 99.7°F. After this I was sore but otherwise completely okay, the next day I had a temp of 99.5°F. Today I am back to normal. I think I had either a seizure or a vasovagal response. The vaccine was administered at Hospital Facility. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the close temporal relationship, the association between the event &#34;began to pass out&#34; with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Over the next few minutes she also developed erythroderma of bilateral forearms and hands, slight swelling of hands, reddened palms.  We assessed her vital signs below, kept her in observation over the next 40 minutes. She denied difficulty breathing, she questioned if her voice was different, but was not detectable to 2 observors. Lungs remained clear, no stridor, no capillary refill delay. Gradually symptoms improved, erythroderma and hand swelling resolved over about 15 minutes. Pt. then noted possible tongue swelling, on the sides at 25 minutes post vaccine but again, no difficulty with breathing or swallowing. Vital signs continued to improve, pt. then stated itching was gone and tongue felt better so she was released and advised to return to E.R. in event of change. Pt. is a phyician.

                                                I received the vaccine at 0615 am on 1/8/21.  Had no symptoms (not even injection site pain). At 2100 on 1/8, began to develop a lot of pain at the injection site.  Within 2 hrs of that time, I developed other symptoms, which include total body (bone and joint) pain (especially in my knees), and what I would describe as a &#34;bad sunburn type&#34; rash across my cheek bones, bridge of my nose, and orbital area.  Small raised bumps to this area, with swelling, and a feeling of pins and needles stabbing me all across my face.  My airway was fine, and at no time did I feel shortness of breath.  I was unable to sleep due to the bone and joint pain, and felt the need to walk continually (it was more painful to stay in one position). These symptoms persisted throughout the day (Saturday 1/9/21), noting at 5pm I described myself &#34;miserable&#34; to my friends and family.  All symptoms described above,  were at their most elevated intensity between the hours of 1700 - 0400. At 0400 Sunday (1/10/21) I felt a gradual release of the body aches, enough so that I could sleep until 0800.  At this time, 1300 (Sunday 1/10)  I note that I still feel &#34;flu type&#34; body aches, but constant pain has diminished in intensity by estimated 50%.  The sunburn type redness and swelling across my face/orbital area has also less by 50% (there is still redness, mild swelling, warmth, and some raised bumps across this area;  pins and needles feeling is gone).

A 59-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 30Dec2020 14:15 at first single dose (0.3 cc, but really uncertain of dose) for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID virus from Nov2020 to 2020 (The patient was not hospitalized. It was a mild case and lasted about 10 days. she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines at the same time or 4 weeks prior. No problems with vaccinations in past or events.  Caller reported she had the first injection of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on the 30Dec2020 and having some side effect symptoms and her supervisor recommended for her to report these things, they are not life threatening, obviously, but things were still lingering. Side effect of severe fatigue started on the 31Dec2020 and lasted for 72 hours. It was so severe, now it is mild. The patient reported soreness around the injection site. Had a fever on the night of the 31Dec2020 of 101.3 and had that for 6 hours then it dissipated and was gone. Had never had a fever after injections before. Had severe arm pain that usually goes along with an injection. It started also that night of 31Dec2020. She had rolled over in the middle of the night and it hurt. That lasted for about 48 hours, but it has improved. Had some muscle aches since 31Dec2020 but that had improved and had joint pains since 31Dec2020. What was worrisome was the swollen lymph nodes under her right arm, the armpit area had swollen and painful lymph nodes, since 31Dec2020. The patient was still having that and that is why she was so concerned because shouldn&#39;t that have gone away after a week. Had knee and hip joint pain, but that had improved. Again, mentioned she had never had that before with an injection. The patient received vaccine at her workplace. Some of her coworkers got it the same day and no one else has this. Mentioned she did have COVID virus back in Nov2020 and wonders if this correlates with her getting the vaccine. Was not hospitalized or notified she had any positive antibodies at that time. Was off work for about 12 days and was very lucky to have had a very light case with fever, cough, cold, and super fatigue. This is the same way she felt back when she had the virus back in November. The patient was concerned about having these side effects would it be okay for her to get the next injection in 3 weeks. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room and physician office. No further details provided. Outcome of the events Fever was recovered, of event swollen and painful lymph nodes was not recovered, of events knees and hip joint pain, fatigue, muscle pain, severe arm pain was recovering, of event soreness around the injection site was unknown.  The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as serious (medically significant). The reporter considered the events severe fatigue, fever, severe arm pain, muscle ache, swollen lymph nodes and pain under right arm, knees and hip joint pain as related to BNT162B2.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association, the vaccination with BNT162B2 might play a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                About 2 min after receiving injection, I felt an intense flushing feeling all over, it felt as if my blood had turned into lava. About a minute after that I felt a &#34;tickle&#34; in my throat. The same sensation I felt  when I had my reaction to Gadolinium.  I tried to swallow, and it was a little difficult. I did NOT feel short of breath. I tried to calm down by doing slow concentrated breathing. I continued to take small sips of water to gauge my swallowing ability. After about 2-3 minutes, the flushing sensation subsided, and swallowing started to improve.  I had brought my Epinephrine pen with me.  About 1-2 min after the flushing sensation had subsided,, it came back and my swallowing ability got much worse, to the point I couldn&#39;t  swallow a small sip. I was breathing well, and did NOT feel short of breath, but gave myself my Epinephrine injection at that time. A Rapid Response was called at that time, my vitals signs taken, an IV inserted, 911 called. O2 sats were fine mid 90&#39;s, heart rate was mid 80&#39;s, BP was elevated,  I don&#39;t remember the exact systolic 170-180, but my diastolic was 116. It took the ambulance approximately 10-15 min to arrive. By the time the ambulance arrived, I was feeling close to my baseline and my BP was improving.  I was seen by the ER MD, and feeling fairly well, my throat still felt a tiny bit tight, but no difficulties swallowing.  The plan was to complete  treatment with IV steroids, Benadryl, and Pepcid, then be observed for a few more hours. This was approximately around 16:30. Not more than 5 min after MD left my room, I got the flushing feeling, and throat closing feeling again. While the medications were being prepared these  symptoms increased, ( I could still breath adequately and vital signs were still  OK.  It took about 10 minutes after meds were given for symptoms to begin to subside ( No epi given) I was observed until 21:30 then discharged. I am taking 50 mg daily x 3 days, 25mg Benadryl q 8hrs x 3 days, and 20mg Pepcid bid x 3 days. I feel fine , no further episodes

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot #: not sure EL3249 or EU3249), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose at left deltoid for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension, hypothyroidism, heartburn. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, olmesartan, hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, omeprazole for heartburn, alprazolam. Patient had the tiredness, mouth sores or something like that in Jan2021. When patient look at her cheek, the gum inside cheek have white spots on it and it looked red and swollen and it hurt, especially the left side and that bothered patient because patient cannot really eat and it hurt. It was more of the cheek inside the mouth, that&#39;s painful. It&#39;s not open sore but it&#39;s just red and like tender. And also patient had a tenderness of lymph nodes on the left neck. For causality, the patient thought so because nothing has changed since before patient got the vaccine. Patient didn&#39;t have any of this, especially the sore in the mouth. Patient cannot eat on the left side because it hurt. But the rest of the symptoms which was the tiredness and the swelling of the lymph node, lymph node was kind of tender but it&#39;s only on the left side, that&#39;s listed as the side effects. But the sores in the mouth was not listed that&#39;s why patient was worried about that. Lab work: results were okay. The tiredness, it was like patient got it in the morning, so patient slept. Patient went straight after work, then patient slept. When patient started getting ready for work and the alarm went off, patient was extra tired so I called out sick, but patient was okay. For treatment, patient took naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and then, because patient was at work and yesterday it was really bothering patient because it was hurting. It started hurting really more when the evening was on. Then patient took paracetamol (TYLENOL), then the nystatin solution, patient tried to swish and it helped a little bit with the pain. Due date for the next dose was 08Feb2021. Outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.

Reporter was referred to HCP or vaccination provider to determine if this was a severe allergic reaction and if she should receive the second dose of the vaccine.

A 59-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, unknown lot number and expiration), via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 19Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included sinus problems, allergy, allergy to cow&#39;s milk, TMJ (she had her wisdom teeth she was having issues on the right side; after they pulled it out she was fine), and wisdom teeth pulled out at the age of 57 or 58.  Concomitant medication included ascorbic acid, biotin, folic acid, iron, manganese, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, retinol, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine, vitamin b12 nos, vitamin d nos, vitamin e nos, zinc (CENTRUM FRUITY CHEWABLES).  The patient previously took keflex and was allergic to it. The patient received her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 19Jan2021. She was okay from Tuesday to Thursday. On Friday (22Jan2021), the patient reported to have felt sick similar to a sinus infection, there were pressure in front of head, jaw, and right ear and was dizzy on and off for a long period. She had a sinus pressure/pressure in her nose and felt like she had a bad sinus infection in whole head. She is not saying she had a sinus infection, but that&#39;s what she experienced after receiving the shot. Her right ear was aching, head was ache, and jaw was also aching/throbbing on unspecified dates. The patient mentioned that she had swelling of bottom lip and it was hot/bottom of the lip (underneath) was swollen on 07Feb2021 but it went away today (08Feb2021). It was actually her neighbor that noticed the swelling and said it was on the bottom of lip chin area, it also felt hard when touching it. She called her primary care doctor following the events. At first, she did not want to provide these to her primary care, she did not have high blood pressure, high cholesterol or anything, but she did have bad sinuses. She took an antibiotic for sinus and pressure and her doctor told her that these could be side effects of the COVID vaccine as it causes dizziness and pressure. The dizziness must have been from the pressure since it was in her ear, cheek bones, and right ear was throbbing. It took her one month to come back to her normal self. The patient is scheduled to receive the next shot on 09Feb2021 and asked if she need to get the next shot or should she wait another week.

I reached a fever of 103.6 and had pain and extreme redness in my right tissue expander. I also had all axillary lymph nodes removed from that side in December 2020. On Friday I was still feeling ill and noticed redness, so I immediately contacted my doctor and was instructed to meet him at the hospital. I was admitted and placed on antibiotics and had my tissue expander removed The next morning after no improvement from antibiotic infusion. I had a wound vac placed and stayed in the hospital for one week and had my expander replaced on that following Saturday.  I am not planning on taking the second shot.

A 59-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6202) (at the age of 59) as a single dose, for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included an unspecified heart condition and a flu shot un an unspecified date. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (SYNTHROID) and ascorbic acid, ergocalciferol, nicotinamide, retinol, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride (VITAMINS [ASCORBIC ACID;ERGOCALCIFEROL;NICOTINAMIDE;RETINOL;RIBOFLAVIN;THIAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE). The patient stated, &#34;I am calling about the side effects I had from my Covid shot vaccine. I am concerned about getting the second one because my reaction was so big. I got it on Saturday, this past Saturday about 12:45 I think 12:30 and I did fine, the shot didn&#39;t hurt at all. That night I was a little bit tired but that&#39;s it. My arm was just little bit sore. The next day I got up, I still felt good I went to work for 2 hours and then about 12 o&#39;clock it hit me all at once. This Sunday I ran anywhere from a 103 to 104.6 fever and that was me taking Tylenol and I took Tylenol every 4 hour because my fever was still high. The glands in my neck and the glands under my arm on the side where I got the shot swelled up, they are still swollen. My whole body ached. I had Covid fairly bad I got pneumonia with it all for &#34;two weeks&#34; (not clarified) but my fever was not as high as got with the shot, the vaccine like I could barely walk after the vaccine because my joints were so stiff only way I could walk was to shuffle my feet, it was horrible. I had a fever yesterday all day but it was only in the 102.3 and 4, it never went back to 103. Glands in my arm and my neck hurt quite badly. My arm where I got it, it wasn&#39;t swollen but I get the same reaction when I get a Flu shot (unspecified shot) so that&#39;s not a big deal. I got horrible headaches. I had diarrhea all day Sunday and yesterday and so this morning my fever is only right around 101 like 101.1, 101.2, I am still super tired and also yesterday and day before I was dizzy and foggy. I still have a slight fever today. My lymph nodes are still swollen, my neck and under my arm, my arm where I got the shot is still swollen and sore but I can tolerate that. My joints are stiff a little bit but not nearly as bad as they were, so I don&#39;t know if I should get the second shot, everyone says the second shot is worst like all those heart palpitations start with it as well.&#34; One of my other symptom is at night I break out into a horrible sweat like I have to change my pajamas twice. It was last night and the night before. I am like really wet.&#34;  The outcome of the events was not reported.

                                                Within a few hours of shot, I experienced EXTREME tinnitus (very loud), numbness in head, face and lips and hardening of lymph gland in left chest. This lasted for hours. Injection site pain only lasted about 24 hours.  Since then, I still have numbness on the right side top of head and intermittent EXTREME  tinnitus that interferes with my ability to concentrate, communicate and sleep. It comes and goes but the volume is beyond anything I have ever experienced. Then it goes away. The  right side of my head has stayed numb.   Will this go away? Should I get the 2nd dose or not?
