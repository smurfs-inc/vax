It cleared in approximately a minute. The 2nd heat flash came on about 5 to 10 minutes later and cleared about a minute later.

I walked over to the office, my supervisor asked if I was ok as she said it looked like my eyes were glazed over, my head was still in a fog. This cleared by 2:30 p.m.

In about two more minutes my right was swollen closed and speaking became difficult due to the swelling.  My wife drove me to Hospital and I received Epinephrine and Benadryl and fluids.

She diagnosed &#34;Swollen sub-mandibular &amp; pre-auricular lymphatic nodes.&#34;  I am being treated with: 1) Erythromycin Ophth Oint 3.5GM 2) Prednisolone AC 1% Ophth Susp 5ML 3) Pataday  Doctor believes that my viral infection might be a result of the Covid 19 vaccine, and gives assurance that her treatment will resolve issues. She is unsure whether, or not, I am considered contagious during this time? Inquiries at the college were unfruitful.   I hope my reporting this is not a violation in any way. Many thanks.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

A 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EK5780) in  left arm on 26Dec2020 at 08:30 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation (worked in surgical ICU and was over 61 years old).  Medical history included Pre-diabetic. Family history included: mother died; mother&#39;s side had colon cancer and grandparents and uncles had cardiovascular diseases.Concomitant medication included exenatide (BYDUREON), amlodipine besilate (NORVASC), omeprazole (PROTONIX), hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril and pneumococcal vaccine on 08Dec2020 and tetanus vaccine on 08Dec2020.  It was reported that on 31Dec2020 at 07:30, the patient had eye tearing and water leaking out of mouth, left side of face was sagging, swelling on lower left mandible (eye tearing was first, as reported); on 31Dec2020 he also experienced progressive weakness on left side of face; on 02Jan2021 the patient was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s Palsy. Then on an unknown date, left side will blur occurred. All events required emergency room visit and physician office visit. Diagnosis of  Bell&#39;s Palsy and event eye tearing were serious per disability; left side will blur was non serious. Patient described the events as follows: on 31Dec2020 he was brushing teeth and noticed the water was going everywhere. Left side of face was sagging, noticed some swelling and thought it was from a bug bite. He wasn&#39;t sure if it was a stroke or not. In the morning of 01Jan2021 noticed it was progressively causing a problem. Days before noticed tearing of left eye (as reported). On 31Dec2020 before midnight, something felt wrong. He saw four cases on clinical trial with similar side effects (he clarified he had no patient information for the four patients mentioned with similar side effects from Pfizer Clinical trial. He saw this information from a article; stated four from Pfizer and Moderna). In the morning of 02Jan202, he went to Emergency Room (ER) and was diagnosed with Bells Palsy. He was given prednisone 20mg to take 3 times by mouth every day for 5 days, tetracycline 100mg, at 1 capsule by mouth twice a day for 10 days and methylprednisolone (SOLU MEDROL; Lot: 9945776;Exp: Nov2021) 4mg dose pack, started with 6 tablets first day. It was told by doctor it might cause tick problems. He was waiting for results. On 04Jan2021 went to family doctor and more blood work was taken. Because he was taking prednisone, noticed his sugar was up a little bit (date unspecified). It was prescribed Glitizide extended release, 2.5mg one tablet twice a day with breakfast. Patient was checking sugar every 6 hours. It was also prescribed Acyclovir 400mg one tablet orally five times per day for 10 days. 08Jan2021 is last day of prednisone 5 day dose and will follow up with methylprednisolone tablets. Patient had an appointment with a neurologist on 13Jan2021. Patient was still having symptoms. It was really hard for him. Not hard to swallow. Face was still drooping. Eyes were still tearing. Could not work with eyes tearing all of the time. Needed to be alert. When driving, had to focus on the right side because his left side will blur. He had to chew only on the right side because food will be left behind in between his cheeks and gums. If he drank through a straw, he had to cover the left side of his lips so he was able to suck out fluids. He thought symptoms were progressively getting worse, he didn&#39;t see much improvement. He clarified swelling was on lower part of mandible on left side. It was slightly bigger than right. When looking at face, the lines on his forehead on the left side were down. If he smiled he cannot raise his left eye brow, when before the COVID-19 vaccine he could. Noticed left side of nose was lower than the right. Cannot raise left side of lips. Outcome of the event Eyes tearing and Bell&#39;s Palsy was not recovered; outcome of the other event was unknown. Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported events of Bell&#39;s palsy, Lacrimation increased  and vision blurred due to temporal relationship.  However,  the Bell&#39;s palsy may likely possibly  represent concurrent medical condition in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including head CT/MRI and viral serologies, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Medical history included triple bypass surgery from an unknown date. There were no concomitant medications.  The patient previously took morphine and experienced the same thing with his brain, almost identical to what he was experiencing after the COVID vaccine. He reported that the first time he received morphine it was fine and then he got a shot of morphine and he experienced the pressure on his brain after receiving morphine, about 5 or 6 years before reporting time. He stated it was almost the same reaction. He was given a shot of Demerol (he was not sure if it was Demerol) to counteract it. History of all previous immunization reported as none. No additional vaccines administered on the same date. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient reported he experienced an &#34;allergic reaction&#34;/ bad reaction to his first dose of BNT162B2 on 22Jan2021. His symptoms included dizziness as soon as he got the vaccine, got dizzy right off the bat, still dizzy, very little; feeling a lot of pressure in his head like his &#34;brain wanted to pop out of his head&#34;/ his brain wanted to swell up; felt like he was going to lose his mind / go crazy; fever; headache is recurring- worse at bedtime.

Last night he went to bed no problem, he felt a little pressure on his brain, stated it is hard to describe, it was not a good feeling. He was running a fever. Last night he had a slight fever, like it was going away. He was not able to drive when this was happening and today was the first day he could drive and he was not comfortable (27Jan2021). The patient declined any treatment. He already talked to his doctor and was told to call Pfizer. He asked if he was to get the second shot, is there something he could to take to make that feeling go away or counteract it. No relevant tests were reported. Events did not require a visit to the emergency room nor physician office. The outcome of the events, allergic reaction, headache is recurring- worse at bedtime, almost passed out and he was not comfortable was unknown.

                                                Hospital course 1/31 ? 2/20/21 1/31 in ED pt was at home when children noticed his lips were blue, ems arrived and found him to be 50% on RA, on Non-rebreather pt got to 78%, covid on 01/26   Shortness of Breath   61-year-old male presents with EMS for evaluation of shortness of breath hypoxia.  History is limited due to the patient&#39;s current clinical condition and so is primarily obtained from EMS.  EMS reports that he tested positive for COVID-19 5 days ago.  He began developing shortness of breath yesterday and his family called because his lips and fingers were blue today and he appeared short of breath.  On EMS arrival he had a room air saturation of less than 50% so he was placed on nonrebreather with improvement in his saturation to 70% and he was transported to the emergency department.  Patient does admit to shortness of breath.  He denies any chest pain.  He is noted to have a cast on his left ankle and said that he broke his left ankle on 23 December but has not had surgery.  He denies any new pain or swelling of the leg.  In the ED he was placed on 15L nasal cannula and NRB mask with improvement in SPO2 to low 90s. Additional work up revealed troponin of 1.35, lactic acid 5.8, and d-dimer 14.4.  He received dexamethasone and was placed on heparin gtt.   1/31 admitted to ICU Acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 vs heart failure vs PE.  CXR with bilateral hazy infiltrates more pronounced in the bases and left periphery and suspected multifocal pneumonia.   At risk for PE given LLE immobility in the setting of COVID-19 with significantly elevated d-dimer. RISK of CTA outweighs benefit given AKI and iodine allergy. Continue with empiric treatment with heparin gtt.   Admitted to ICU with SO2 in 60s-70s on 15L and NRB. Attempted 50L 95% FIO2 high flow and nasal cannula. Given lasix 40mg IV with good diuresis however SPO2 still remained low 80s with RR 40s and PO2 42 so the decision was made to intubate.  Oxygenation improved following intubation, with further improvement following recruitment maneuver and increase in PEEP. FIO2 weaned to 90% with SPO2 remaining in mid 90s. Will continue to wean FIO2 as able.  ARDS net protocol as much as possible. Consider prone ventilation and/or epoprostenol if unable to improve .  VAP Bundle: HOB &gt;30 degrees; Oral care per nursing standard and on DVT/PPI prophylaxis Sedation: Target Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) of 0 to -2 with propofol and fentanyl. Check baseline TG levels.    COVID - 19: Convalescent plasma: Not indicated  Steroids: Dexamethasone 6 mg / day for 10 days Remdesivir: Not indicated d/t AKI   IL-6 inhibitor: Meets criteria for tocilizumab Systemic AC: Heparin gtt. No signs of bleeding (Platelets and Hb stable).  Antibiotics: Start 3 and 7 day course of azithromycin and ceftriaxone, respectively.  Elevated troponin  Suspect demand ischemia d/t hypoxia; EKG does not show any ischemic changes    AKI: Suspect d/t hypoxia in the setting of COVID infection. Urine output and electrolytes acceptable.  Closed fracture of left ankle Suffered fracture following a fall on ice in December. Cast was placed on 12/30 by SOS. He was due to be re-evaluated this week for possible cast removal.    Inhaled epoprostenol started  Considered for ECMO but not initiated due to not a candidate  Vasopressors required at times  Antihypertensive infusion required at times  severe hypoxia with position changes  switched from heparin drip to enoxaparin prophylaxis  2/20 discharge summary 61 y/o male admitted to Hospital on 1/31 with hypoxia.  He was diagnosed with COVID 19 5 days prior to admission, and had worsening respiratory status.  He was intubated after arrival, and was on ventilator for the entire intervening time, until he was extubated on 2/20 at the time of transition to Comfort measures only.    Prior to developing COVID 19, he had received his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, as a member of the school system.  He had a fractured L ankle after a fall on 12/31/20, and had a cast in place at the time of admission.  He received Tocilizumab on 1/31, and underwent several cycles of prone positioning, beginning on 2/2.  He completed a course of Decadron, he received  Ceftriaxone and azithromycin beginning on admission, and completed a course of these.  Anticoagulation with enoxaparin was utilized due to coagulopathy associated with COVID 19.  Vasopressor support was required at times, as well as diuresis for fluid management.    He required high levels of sedation to maintain ventilator synchrony, and high levels of ventilator support with high oxygen levels throughout his stay.  Tracheostomy was being considered, but family decided that since he was not going to have good recovery, withdrawal of support, and allowing death was the appropriate choice for the patient and for them.   He was extubated at 2100 on 2/20/2021.   Death was pronounced at 2123 on 2/20/2021.  Children were at bedside.

The exact date of the vaccine is unknown. His girlfriend told me he got his second Vaccine at the end of February. I also don&#39;t know what vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer) he got, so the Pfizer is just a guess. Patient started feeling bad and looking bad after his second vaccine. He complained that he wasn&#39;t feeling well and missed appointments saying he wasn&#39;t feeling well during the two weeks or so between the time of his second vaccine and his death.

A 62-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in left deltoid, on 30Dec2020 10:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing mild intraocular pressure. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included unspecified eye drops for a mild intraocular pressure. The patient previously took tetanus vaccine and experienced vagal reaction and passed out (in his childhood). The patient&#39;s past COVID tests were always negative. On 30Dec2020, the patient received it at a facility where he is a physician on staff, and they started giving it that day. It was administered by a pharmacist who was very clean and professional, and everything was fine. The patient received the COVID-19 vaccine in the left deltoid and felt pinched when the vaccine was administered, and he felt fine. He did not have any immediate reaction. He sat down, then got up and was standing talking to some colleagues, and about 10 to 15 minutes later, they were talking and felt a little postnasal drip in throat. His colleagues said that is what they felt as well. About 10 minutes later, the patient was feeling warm then really hot to the point where he felt the need for cool air. He added feeling weak and clammy as if he was going to pass out. He started to feel weak and warm and almost like a vagal reaction if you got a needle or were scared. It was almost like he felt hot, sweaty, and weak and feeling like he needed to get to a cool place and sit down. The patient&#39;s heart might have been beating fast, but he did not check his pulse. The patient went outside where the temperature was in the thirties and cold. The patient broke out in sweat and felt weak. The patient sat down, and it was cold outside, and he felt better. It passed and he felt fine after that. The symptoms lasted 10-15 minutes top, and it was resolved after the peak. The patient had soreness at the muscle site which got better overnight; little muscle soreness from the vaccine. The patient then got better and felt no other symptoms. He looked up the side effects and talked to the pharmacist. He spoke with a pharmacist, who provided the information on the reported adverse reaction of the COVID-19 vaccines and the signs of a severe allergic reaction included in the PI. He is not an allergic type person. He is familiar with those reactions and never had any trouble. He wasn&#39;t quite sure if it was related but then said it is probably somewhat related. The patient explained that he doesn&#39;t have any of the reported adverse reactions in the PI; but his experience is like the dizziness related in the signs of a severe allergic reaction in the PI, and he did feel that his heartbeat was fast. He is fine now though. The patient asked if his event is related to the vaccine and what is the impact on getting the second dose when reacting to the first. The patient was thinking that this event is a vagal reaction but delayed. He also explained that he was speaking with his colleagues, right after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, regarding postnasal drip reaction. The patient also wondered if anxiety related to this discussion could have triggered his symptoms. Originally, he thought it was just him. But after talking to colleagues, maybe he was just a little anxious. He did not feel anxious going in. He did not need any intervention. He did not take any diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) or anything. He sat and rested, and it passed. He has been fine since. He needs a second dose in 3 weeks. There is not a lot of information about the side effects. It was not like he got a rash. He did not have any swelling of the tongue or throat. He just wanted to find out about if he should get the second dose. He really wanted to get the second dose. He just wanted to know if this was common or a concern and should he take the second dose. There were a lot of people getting the vaccine and this was not anything that stopped anyone from getting it. He is just trying to make sure and see how likely it was that it was related to the vaccine and how does it affect him getting the second dose. The patient was recovering from &#34;Felt pinched when the vaccine was administered; soreness at the muscle site; little muscle soreness from the vaccine&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Postnasal drip in throat&#34; and &#34;Anxiety; anxious&#34; was unknown. The patient recovered from the other events on 30Dec2020.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

The wife stated that she does not believe the death was due to the vaccination; however, there were no tests completed to prove or disprove.

                                                Only slight soreness at injection site first day.   I was physically working hard out of town with limited sleep for next three days.  I began experiencing significant body aches and pains, sneezing and minor congestion.  However, activity involved substantial dust as I was sanding a floor.  Saturday, January 2, I began having more extensive cold symptoms, coughing and runny nose with continued body aches and pains.  I scheduled a covid test on Monday, January 4, scheduled for Wed. January 6th.  I received positive results on Friday. January 8.  On Saturday, January 8, I began developing increased light headedness and self monitored my blood pressure.  It was at 191/107 when I went to Hospital to have it checked.  I was released that afternoon.

A 63-years-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EH9899, expiry date was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 21Dec2020 14:40, at a single dose for Covid 19. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient has no prior vaccinations -within 4 weeks. The patient is an EEG technician. On 22Dec2020, the patient reported the next day he started to feel sluggish, chills, tired/fatigue, pain all over his body, patient mentioned he has lost weight everyday since he got the shot from 153 pounds to 142 pounds; then on Wednesday evening 23Dec2020, it was a nightmare, he got sweating; fever with a high of 101.4 Fahrenheit; he was running to bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine; and he was so tired and fatigued. Added when he was getting up all that night he was having night sweats up to five times a night and chills; and his heart was pounding. The urination, heart pounding resolved the next day. All of these events have improved at the time of report (now) or gone away but he is still sweating once at night for the last two days and he is tired and fatigued. He stated that he is scheduled for the second dose on 11Jan2021 and he is concerned if he should take the vaccine. He mentioned that he was tested for COVID 19 on 18Dec2020 and the result was inconclusive. He went again 23Dec2020 they called him on 25Dec2020 and informed he was positive per the PCR test. He treated himself with 500mg acetaminophen (UPC 0904672059; lot OBE2896 and expiration Oct2021) and azithromycin Z-Pack (NDC 65862-641-69; Lot ZYSA20012-A; and expiration date Mar2022). The sample of the product is not available to be returned. Predisposing factor was that the patient&#39;s wife was at home and was sick too at the same time. She was tested Sunday with no results yet. The outcome of the events of fever recovered on 28Dec2020, sluggishness recovered on 29Dec2020, pain all over the body was recovered on 02Jan2021; running to the bathroom with urination every 15 minutes with a large amount of urine and heart pounding were recovered on 24Dec2020, weight loss was not recovered, and for other events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the mechanism of action of BNT162B2 vaccine, it is unlikely the patient would have fully developed immunity for the vaccine to be effective, due to the number of days passed since the vaccine was given (4 days in this case). However, a causal relationship between event &#34;COVID-19 PCR test/he was positive per the PCR test&#34; (coded to Drug ineffective / SARS-CoV-2 test positive) and BNT162B2 vaccine cannot be completely excluded

Increase in metabolism leading to being warm all the time ( no sweating).  Two weeks after second vaccine and while experiencing the above symptoms, I had sudden palpitations with a rapid ventricular response ( 186 beats per minute), severe light headedness, ambulance transport to hospital leading to admission for two days.  This has never happened to me or any family members before.  Discharged from hospital after 2 days in normal rhythm.  Also at this time, taste has returned to normal and foggy feeling has improved.

By 10:30pm, I began having flu like symptoms, (aches, low grade fever, sinus symptoms) took another acetaminophen 1 GM.  At 11:00 pm, developed severe rigors that lasted for approximately 2 hours. I am an RN and I have seen many cases of sepsis and felt like I was experiencing similar symptomatology.   By 1:45 am, the rigors finally ceased and the body, muscle and joint pain became severe (on a pain scale of 1-10, it was an 8).    At 7:00 am, I took another acetaminophen 1 GM, the body pain became much less and I was experiencing a global headache.  I do not get headaches, so this was unusual.  By 10:00 am, the headache was minimal, body aches were gone, only sinus symptoms persisted.

He is placed on 2 L nasal cannula for comfort.  He received 2 DuoNeb treatments with EMS as well as Solu-Medrol.  I am going to treated with a continuous nebulizer treatment and obtained laboratory workup as well as chest x-ray.  Vital sign show tachycardia which is likely from his albuterol treatment, he is mildly tachypneic, otherwise stable.   Patient&#39;s laboratory workup is reassuring, troponin is negative.  Chest x-ray does not show any consolidation.  Patient does have some improvement in his symptoms after his continuous nebulizer treatment.  His VBG is repeated after treatment and shows that his pCO2 is going down however he is still slightly acidotic with the pH of 7.28.  Patient reports that he still tight in his chest, improved however uncomfortable going home.  He is still significantly wheezing on my exam, given this I did discuss this case with emergency department observation who agreed to accept for admission.  COVID testing is negative.  Patient is admitted in stable condition. Pulmonary:     Comments: Patient is sitting forward in the stretcher, he is tachypneic, prolonged expiratory phase with expiratory wheezing in all lung fields.

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) at single dose at left deltoid on 02Jan2021 17:00 for covid-19 immunisation, administered an injection team that is part of the local hospital system.  Medical history included controlled hypertension and he has been taking the blood pressure medicine for a long time. The concomitant medications included unspecified medicines for controlled hypertension. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the BNT162B2 vaccine. On 02Jan2021 the patient experienced injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 the patient experienced cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. No event did require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. No relevant tests performed. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of chills, fever, general malaise, low grade headache, sweating. Course of events: He said initially he had no adverse events after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine, except injection site pain. He said he thought the injection site pain could be from the COVID-19 Vaccine being viscous, and didn&#39;t think anything else about the injection site pain. On 03Jan2021 he started to experience some. He stated he did not normally take vaccines, like the flu vaccine. He said he has been a podiatrist for 39 years, and realized the importance of getting the vaccine to protect his patients. He then developed chills, muscle pain, fever, and general malaise. He said he experienced every side effect listed on the received COVID-19 Vaccine paperwork, except he had no lymphadenopathy.  He said all the side effects he experienced appeared 24 hours to the minute from when he received the COVID-19 Vaccine. On 03Jan2021, he had swelling in his cheeks and around his eyes. He did not get sick often. He said he had a rough night on 03Jan2021 and on 03Jan2021 he still felt wiped out. Treatment: he took 2 Tylenol 325mg at the start of the side effects, and then took another 2 Tylenol 325mg at 2:00AM. He said he woke up soaking wet with chills and sweats. He said his fever broke, but he did not know how high his fever was. He took from a fresh bottle of Tylenol 325mg. The outcome of injection site pain, cheek swelling, periorbital swelling/swelling around his eyes, feeling wiped out, muscle pain, joint pain, general malaise was recovering, of chills, fever, sweating was recovered in Jan2021, of low grade headache was not recovered.  The reporter considered there was a reasonable possibility that all events were related to bnt162b2 vaccine.  He was scheduled to receive another COVID-19 Vaccine injection in 3 weeks.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

By evening about 12 hours post vaccine felt fatigue and some increase in mild baseline myalgias.  During night sleep significantly disrupted by generalized myalgias, along with some strange transient paresthesia.     Such that at about 4:30 AM I texted my 3 workplaces that I did not expect to go to work that day.  Went back to bed, woke up around 9:30 AM 1/8/2021 and nearly all myalgias resolved, still fatigued but better.  Paresthesia&#39;s were transient and resolved.  Went to work after all.  Today, Saturday 1/9/21 woke up and all symptoms resolved.

A 67-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 02Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. There were no concomitant medications nor medical history. He did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. No history of any other vaccines or events. He got his vaccine on Saturday(02Jan2021) at 1:30pm(13:30) and by 5:30pm(17:30) had very sore arms/arm pain, at 7:30pm(19:30) he had chills off and on and was sweating. He woke up soaking wet and did that on Sunday, but was feeling a little better today. He also experienced body aches and fever in Jan2021. Today is testing day at his work and he tested positive for COVID virus on 05Jan2021. Not sure if it&#39;s a coincidence. Again, he got the shot and then started having all these symptoms at 5:30 and 7:30. Now they are both on quarantine for the 10-14 days. He wanted to see if it&#39;s possible to test positive for the virus after getting the shot or is it just a coincidence. He also had some muscle aches in Jan2021. Last night (04Jan2021), he woke up again sweating, but not like on Saturday, but he got really warm and started to sweat a little, and on Sunday(03Jan2021) he was cold all day and had a tiny cough, but it wasn&#39;t significant. Ever so often she would hear him cough. All of a sudden patient would wake up sweating. Again, Saturday he soaked everything. There was no Emergency Room nor Physician Office. Outcome of Very sore arms, sweating was recovering, of pain and fever was unknown, of other events was not recovered.    Information on Lot/Batch has been requested.

No tachycardia as he was checking his Apple Watch and no other symptoms.  ? 10:20 he drove home and called his wife can kept her on the call as he drove. He them experienced some mild tingling in his ears, face and lips.  ? 10:30 he got home and his lips were mildly swollen, more so on the upper lip, not as much on the lower lip.  ? 10:45 he took an Allegra and about 30-40 minutes afterwards the lip swelling started to calm  ? 5:45pm I spoke with him. He said he has no more symptoms. A little tired perhaps from the day or the Allegra (though it doesn?t cause too much drowsiness compared to Benadryl) ? He also reported he had a flu and shingles vaccine back in early November so it has been more than a month.

I took some Benedril which helped with swelling. that was the most severe after effect. I&#39;m pretty sure it was the vaccine because i had not been anywhere that weekend and had not  put my hands on anything unusual that i don&#39;t normally touch. It only happened to my hands. Other than that i had minor flu like symtoms from the shot,  achiness and slight fatigue feeling. I had an ER doctor look at my hands when i went in today to get help for my bronchitis, which i had some before the covid shot. It got worse on Monday. He perscribed prednisone which has pretty much taken the hand spots away..i was tested negative for covid today(1/19/21) by the way.

They had dinner at 5 pm and at 6pm they were sitting on the couch and all of sudden he started slurring his words and he said his mouth felt like someone give him Novocain and then he had his arm around her and all of sudden it felt like he was choking her so she grabbed his hand and his fingers started rolling up, started closing up tight so she started playing with his fingers and then he went out in the kitchen and then he hit the floor and she called # and the paramedics came up there. When they got there he could squeeze both hands and lift both feet by that time it was 7:30, they had just brought in a chair, by time they got done bringing in the chair they realized his left side was becoming paralyzed and so they had to go back and get the stretcher so they were there for about 30 minutes, maybe 15 minutes then they headed up the hill toward the hospital at about 8pm and they came in and gave anti-blood clotting medicine and took him for a scan with dye, they found he still had a blockage on his brain so at 2AM on the 9th they came in with a medical helicopter and flew him to (institution name withheld) in (place name withheld) and they did an MRI on and seen his carotid blockage there so he had emergency surgery at from # that morning of the 09Jan2021 at (institution name withheld) and he was in ICU from Saturday until a week ago at 3 oclock 13Jan2021 he was placed in a regular room and on the 19Jan2021 at 7:30PM he was moved (hospital name) in (place name withheld) for 14 days having 15 hours per day of therapy for a week and then he will go to (place name withheld) (rehab name withheld) and he could be there 2-3 weeks.

He doesn&#39;t know if this has anything to do with the vaccine but wants to know where the shortness of breath is coming from, if it is a side effect. The vaccine was administered on 19Jan2021. He has been very inactive and is waiting for back surgery that has been put off due COVID, the hospital delayed the surgery. He is very likely diabetic and takes one pill a day for this. He also has high blood pressure but is controlled and normal range is 120/70. It was elevated along with his heart rate (on Jan2021) with the bad breathing or shortness of breath episodes. He is trying to get surgical clearance and so he had an echocardiogram the Monday before the vaccine was given and a stress test on the Thursday prior to that. It was given in the upper left arm, he also has a little bruise that is still there now (Jan2021). It was given about 3:30pm. No treatment received. Event outcome of shortness of breath was not recovered, of others was unknown.

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

A 70-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot number: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 09:55 at a single dose on the Upper Left Arm, probably on muscle near the top for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included shellfish allergy, asthma, hay fever, reaction/allergy to oleander plant (rash on his legs) and had surgery on his hip. There were no concomitant medications. The caller received Pfizer&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine early yesterday morning, 13Jan2021 and his second dose has been scheduled for more than 3 weeks. He also mentioned that his vaccine &#34;seems like it isn&#39;t working&#34;. The patient stated it doesn&#39;t look like he had much of a response. All of his neighbor&#39;s arms are so sore and &#39;blah blah&#39; and they have other side effects. He feels like everybody else had a much bigger reaction. He read there was a whole bunch of people that was given the COVID-19 vaccine with a short needle and all of their vaccinations had to be re-done. He really didn&#39;t feel nothing when he was being injection. He explained that when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain on 14Jan2021. However, he was heavily muscled in that area, and also based on his recent surgery on his hip and other experiences, he noticed on the surgeons files on his case, it says he has a high tolerance for pain which he believes to be true. He believes he may have been injected with a short needle. He was just wondering what size of needle is supposed to be used for the Pfizer vaccine and asked how he can find out what needle was used on him.  He doesn&#39;t know if this was an intramuscular injection, but he assumes they were trying to get into the muscle. The patient stated he does have allergies, particularly to shellfish, but they haven&#39;t been really acting up a lot or that much. He told them about his allergies when he was receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, and they kept him for half an hour after receiving it on 13Jan2021. He did feel a little tightness in his breathing. He does have a little bit of asthma and he does have hay fever and all of that stuff. They put the little thing on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, which is little low for him. The next time that checked it first looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%, but the way one holds their finger has something to do with that. He waited a few more minutes and assumed it was probably just allergies. He felt how it feels when he gets into pollen. He took a couple of puffs of his inhaler (Pro air HFA (albuterol sulfate) and the tightness very quickly went back to normal. The last reading when they put the pulse ox on his finger was 96.5. It should be 98 but at that point he talked to them and was feeling much better. He also mentioned he did feel a little bit of heat on his forehead last night (13Jan2021), he might have noticed it. However, the breathing stuff (Tightness/shortness of breath) started again. He used his inhaler again which would have been about 9 hours later, and he also took a Claritin as well. He doesn&#39;t normally take Claritin but he does take it every day up north and the last few weeks he did have his Condo wide open. The patient confirmed the tightness/shortness of breath wasn&#39;t immediately after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, it was about 15-20 minutes after. The feeling felt no different than when he starts having a reaction to cigar smoke or something like that. The tightness/ shortness of breath improved immediately after using his inhaler. He used the inhaler which cleared up the tightness instantly as it always does but his nose was running kind of like when one has the flu. He clarifies he noticed late afternoon/evening; his nose was dripping. The dripping went on for 2-3 hours. He knew the inhaler wouldn&#39;t necessarily stop the dripping, so he figured he better take a Claritin. He stated not too longer after taking the Claritin, maybe 15-20 minutes afterwards when the Claritin started taking effect, the dripping stopped, and it hasn&#39;t been back since. He believes he took one Claritin a day before. The outcome of the event nose dripping was recovered, tightness/shortness of breath and &#39;on his finger (pulse ox) showing he had 95% oxygen uptake, looked like 91% and then it went up to 93%&#39; was recovering, &#39;when he pushes on the injection site, he does feel a little pain&#39; was not recovered while for other events was unknown.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/24/21. No reported adverse reaction at that time. On 3/10/21, developed worsening of chronic back pain. On day of event, took a dose of celecoxib and rivaroxaban (concurrently). He had been avoiding taken chronic celecoxib since at least the time of his last COVID-19 vaccination, and potentially took this fairly rarely due to concern for interaction with his DOAC.   Beginning about 5 minutes after these medicaions were taken, patient felt weak/strange and asked his wife to take him to ED. In ED he was initially somnolent but arousable, but then developed hypotension and hypoxemia. Given IV benadryl initially, but then acutely worsened with development of facial, hand, and neck swelling. Reportedly had substantial &#34;frothing at the mouth.&#34; Treated with SQ epinephrine, IV methylprednisolone, IV famotidine and was intubated with difficulty. Started on an epinephrine infusion due to persistent hypotension (dose up to 0.1 mcg/kg/min) and transferred to referral center ICU (reporting center). On arrival here, notable hand edema, some facial edema.  Ventilator support rapidly weaned to minimal settings. Evaluation and hospitalization ongoing.  Overall clinical assessment is anaphylactic reaction to celecoxib unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination.

                                                terrible terrible stomach pain; bug in his colon; white blood cell 18000/19500; his blood pressure was out of the roof; could not eat anymore; he&#39;s lost 10 pounds; dehydrated; vomiting 5 times; nausea; feeling warm; broke out in sweats; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                My dad received the Pfizer vaccination on 2/5/21.  He was admitted into the hospital the next day for C-Diff bacterial infection.  He had been on dialysis treatments for kidney failure treatment since 2017 and had recently been diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in June 2020.  He had completed his final treatment of chemotherapy on 2/4/21 and several weeks prior had been determined cancer free.  On Tuesday 2/9/21 he was released from the hospital and went home.  Early Thursday morning 2/11/21 @ approximately 1:30 am CST his eyes rolled back in head and he stopped breathing and was non responsive.  My mother called 911 and attempted CPR.  Paramedics arrived and were able to successfully get a pulse then transferred him to the hospital.  He was put on a ventilator @ the hospital and then transferred to a different hospital a few hours later.  He lost pulse/heartbeat several times @ the 2nd hospital he was transferred to.  We were not allowed to travel with him or see him b/c of all of the COVID restrictions.  We were communicating with the ICU doctor by phone who ultimately communicated to us that there was nothing further that could be done to save his life. He subsequently passed away @ approximately 8:55 am CST on 2/11/21.

With these, his primary care provider was very much concerned, and he had a battery of tests done then he was discovered to have a urinary tract infection (UTI) on 22Jan2021.

A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number: EK5730, Expiration date: Mar2021, at single dose on 17Dec2020, and second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EK9231, expiration date Apr2021, Intramuscular at single dose in left shoulder on 04Jan2021 for prevention of covid. Medical history included ongoing Diabetes which was controlled with medication, blood pressure abnormal, microalbumin level that was high in urine, TSH was low. Concomitant medications included metformin for two or three years for Diabetes, lisinopril for blood pressure and kidney albumin control (he was found to have a microalbumin level that was high in urine and it was prescribed by his doctor several months ago. It was a kidney albumin control), and ongoing levothyroxine since TSH was low (now his TSH was normal and he was taking it per his doctor). The patient received his second dose of Covid vaccine yesterday (04Jan2021). He took his temperature under his tongue and the reading was 99.5°F last night. His temperature was usually 98 or 97°F. He took two Tylenol tablets last night and he did not go to work today. He also had some injection site pain. He had some body pains. He did not have these side effects with the first dose and understood this vaccine was more than the flu vaccine but he was concerned with the side effects. He received the second dose yesterday at 9:30 am. He did not have any problems with the first dose, absolutely nothing. Since last night he could not sleep much states it was intermittent, a lot of body pain, his temperature under the tongue is 99.5 degrees F and most of the time he checks his temperature with a frontal scan and he maintains his temperature around 96 or 97. He was calling to ask if the vaccine can cause covid infection. He did not have any problems yesterday at all prior to the vaccine being administered. When querying outcome of his body pain he stated it was mild. He took 2 caplets of Tylenol yesterday in the middle of the evening. He woke up every hour. He was experiencing an uncomfortable feeling in his body. His temperature was taken about 5 or 10 minutes ago and was 99.3 (states there may be a difference between under the tongue and frontal scan reading). He had to get his temperature checked behind the ear at his workplace since he was coming in from the cold outside. His blood sugar this morning (05Jan2021) was 101. His vision was not really good. Sometimes with the flu vaccine he got the same effect he was getting now but he did not worry about it with the flu vaccine. He received the flu vaccine a long time ago. The outcome of all events was unknown.

                                                shortness of breath, chest xray with pulmonary edema, periorbital edema Narrative:  73 yo M w/ PMH HTN, HLD, EVAR (2013) for AAA c/b persistent type II endoleak s/p multilple repairs (2015 &amp; 2017) c/b glue embolization down into the R CIA secured with additional stent placement with the R iliac limb, s/p b/l Iliac artery aneurysm stent 08/31/20, and PTSD. Former smoker, quit 12&#43; yrs ago. 11/1/20-11/6/20: Hospitalized for acute on chronic back pain, found to multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the axial skeleton. Diagnosed with epithelioid angiosarcoma. Patient discharged to facility. 12/17/20: Patient received his 1st COVID-19 vaccine w/o complications at facility. 12/21/20: Underwent cyberknife treatment. 12/31/20: Transferred from facility to ER for new O2 requirement, SOB, cough, chest X ray / pulm edema, tachycardic and new periorbital edema. 12/31/20: Admitted to ICU before transfer to acute care. 1/1/21: Pulmonary consult, &#34;Labs are notable for progressive left shift with bandemia, markedly elevated inflammatory markers (D-dimer, ESR, CRP, ferritin, LDH), mild elevation in procalcitonin, mild elevation in lactate that has improved, and negative viral panel including COVID-19 x2. CT chest is notable for b/l GGOs along with some interstitial infiltrates with an upper and particularly mid zone and perihilar predominance, septal thickening and crazy paving, and numerous cystic lesions or pneumatoceles. There is a lack of lobar consolidation and pulmonary nodules. Of note, PET/CT about 2 months ago only demonstrated some mild to moderate emphysema mostly in the upper lobes. Therefore, there has been a relatively dramatic change in a few months, suggesting a more subacute process, rather than an acute infectious process such as a viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection, in which the GGOs tend to be subpleural and peripheral. Overall, our suspicion for COVID-19 is relatively low, with negative testing x2 yesterday, negative testing a few weeks ago, and lack of sick contacts, but it is possible. Therefore, higher on the differential is a more subacute infection or chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis. Risk factors include malignancy, chemotherapy, and use of steroids (equivalence of about 27 mg of Prednisone in the form of Dexamethasone since 11/6/20 without PJP prophylaxis). These risk factors, along with consistent imaging and elevated LDH, make PJP quite likely. Fungal infection is less likely based on imaging. Chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis is a possibility, especially given the more subacute picture based on imaging. Both Gemcitabine and Docetaxel can cause pneumonitis. However, the patient has been on steroids, which is used to treat drug-induced pneumonitis, although this does not exclude it completely.&#34; 1/2/21: Transferred to ICU for worsening hypoxemia as patient reached 40L/100% FIO2 and remained on COVID isolation/COVID patient under investigation per ID recommendation. 1/4/21: Isolation precautions discontinued due to lower suspicion for active COVID infection to explain current presentation 1/6/21: Went into atrial fibrillation w/o RVR overnight 1/6. Tolerating, with MAPs in low 60s and HR in high 90s/low 100s. Suspect due to being-1L yesterday from diuresis, lasix stopped. S/p amiodarone bolus &#43; drip, albumin 5% bolus 1/5/21: Macrocytic anemia NOS w/ slowly worsening H/H s/p PRBC x 1 unit 1/7/21: Per ICU Life-sustaining treatment note, &#34;Following discussion w/ patient that his lung dx has been refractory to txt and hasn&#39;t improved despite maximal therapy, patient agreed to transition to hospice after he settles affairs. &#34; 1/7/21 Infectious Disease note: &#34;This is an immunocompromised host due to cancer on active chemotherapy (albeit ANC&gt;4000 on admission) and notably had been on daily PO dexamethasone 1 mg TID (total daily dose 3 mg, equivalent to 20 mg PO prednisone) since 11/6/20 without any PJP ppx. There was elevated c/f COVID-19 infection in setting of patient&#39;s presenting symptoms, especially in conjunction with b/l GGOs on imaging. Has undergone multiple COVID test that have all resulted negative. Discussed radiographic findings with radiology colleagues, and overall, it is difficult to definitively narrow the differential with imaging alone, but overall density of GGOs seem to appear less likely PJP and more in line with chemical pneumonitis vs COVID, although less typical for viral pneumonia as well. Given false-negative COVID tests are not unheard of, especially in the immunocompromised population, patient was kept on isolation precautions as a PUI for abundance of caution. He is now off precautions. In setting of patient having been on prednisone for some time without PJP ppx, he was also started on treatment dose TMP/SMX. Beta-d-glucan has returned positive, and although not the ideal test for PJP, this can certainly support a potential dx of PJP. Unfortunately, DFA from sputum was not performed due to insufficient sample and currently the patient is unable to produce an additional sample for testing. He is tolerating the high-dose TMP/SMX; we adjusted the dose to three SS tablets TID based on his somewhat declining UOP. Other fungal etiologies are pending work-up as well. Lastly, patient&#39;s chemotherapy is known to cause pneumonitis, but per pulmonology team, he receives prophylactic dexamethasone with his chemo cycles that should help to prevent drug-induced pneumonitis. Remains on the differential for now and this should also be concurrently treated with the steroids he is receiving.&#34; 1/10/21: Comfort care initiated. All non-comfort measures were discontinued. Time of death: Jan 10,2021@14:56; immediate cause of death per death note is &#34;hypoxic respiratory failure&#34;

A 74-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number: EL1283) at 0.3 mL single on 20Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thyroid; hypertension, was under control with the medication; dementia, taking memantine as a treatment for dementia, no other impairment other than what he normally has from his dementia. Concomitant medications included levothyroxine; memantine for dementia; fish oil tablet; Vitamins. Patient had a mild heart attack and a slight stroke and he did have urinary tract and blood infection on 24Jan2021. They both had the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on 20Jan2021, Saturday night into Sunday. He was a dementia patient, alert to his name. On 24Jan2021, he fell out of bed and couldn&#39;t get up, he was flushed, so patient&#39;s wife took his temperature, he had a fever of 101. Patient&#39;s wife couldn&#39;t move him, so called the paramedics and they took him to Hospital. Patient&#39;s wife just found out that he had a very mild heart attack and slight stroke, no impairment other than what he normally had from the dementia. Patient&#39;s wife was wondering should he get the second shot and what was the timing of the 2nd dose of vaccine. Reporter seriousness for mild heart attack, slight stroke, urinary tract and blood infection was hospitalization. They also have him on some sort of penicillin derivative for a urinary tract infection. Since he had been to the hospital, he had at his doctor&#39;s office about 2 weeks ago today, he had a blood test, a urine test. His A1C was 6.5, there was a little blood in his urine. For that since Sunday (24Jan2021) he was having MRI, he had a couple of PET scans, he had an electrocardiogram. The neurologist came in to check on him. He was in hospital now. Hospitalization date was 25Jan2021 early in the morning. The outcome of events was unknown.

A 75-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EM9810, Expiry Date: Jun2021) at the age of 74- year-old via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 09:15 at single dose in Arm, Right for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus for about 20-25 years, ongoing kidney disease from 2005, ongoing chronic kidney disease, cardiac pacemaker insertion. The patient was diagnosed with kidney disease in 2005, but it was about 1 to 1-1/2 years ago that his kidney disease progressed to Stage 4 Kidney Disease. She said the Veterans Administration diagnosed her husband with his kidney disease, but her husband saw a private doctor, as well as, a VA doctor for his care. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EL3248; Expiration Date: Apr2021) at the age of 74- year-old Intramuscularly at approximately 08:45AM on 15Jan2021 in right arm for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no Prior Vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office.

My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

A 75-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EZ5138), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 29Jan2021 12:01 (age at time of vaccination:  75 years) at first single dose for COVID-19 immunization; Vaccination Facility: community clinic. Medical history included bone marrow donor from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (about 20 years ago). There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced the following events and outcomes: the caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. on 01Feb2021 at 11:30 with outcome of recovering, it just about wiped out cognitive function on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, slight headache on 29Jan2021 with outcome of unknown, little anxiety on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, shallow breathing on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, change in heart rhythm/change in his pulse rate/his normal is usually 60 but in this case it was 56 to 60 on 01Feb2021 with outcome of recovered on 02Feb2021, exhausted on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, panting on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, hungover feeling/he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation on 02Feb2021 with outcome of recovering, not being able to get around on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown, he shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date with outcome of unknown; all of which were medically significant. The events did not require a visit to a physician office or emergency room (ER).  The patient did not receive any prior vaccinations within four weeks of the bnt162b2; and there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure: good on an unspecified date, height: shrunk from 6 foot getting older on an unspecified date, heart rate: good on an unspecified date, pulse rate: 56 to 60 on an unspecified date.    The caller stated a few days ago he had an intense dizziness after he got the first dose of the vaccine. This was 72 hours after the shot. He had the shot around 12:01 last Friday (29Jan2021). Monday (01Feb2021), about the same time, he had a very very intense dizziness that came on suddenly (came on in about 30 seconds) and it was full blown and it lasted for pretty much 24 hours. It slightly lessened after 20 hours but it was a day before he could stand up. It was not gradual, he knew right then he was in trouble, he couldn&#39;t sit up or roll over. He stated he was in great health but if he was taking medication or had a heart condition he doesn&#39;t think he would be available for this conversation. It stressed him out and he didn&#39;t know he could go that far and come back. He stated it was comparable to cardiac arrest and was a life threatening experience. If other people may have this reaction (if intoxicated or on drugs) they may not survive it. It was very very severe and scary. He stated his reaction seems extreme to everybody he knows. It just about wiped out cognitive function. He stated around here it doesn&#39;t seem that people are having severe reactions. He knows a couple people getting the shot, one who drinks, one who had diabetes and he let them know about this.  Additional Context: The patient stated he wanted to report his experience and ask a question. The patient stated he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 29Jan2021 at 12:01 in the left arm. The patient did not use drugs or alcohol and did not have any medication and had good health. The patient&#39;s heart rate and blood pressure were good. The patient had a slight headache. Then 72 hours later on Monday at about 11:30 he started to get dizzy, suddenly, and it was very intense. The patient took about 12 steps and recognized it and got to the bed. By the time he got there he knew he was in trouble, he had little anxiety and noticed a change in heart rhythm. The dizziness was very intense and intensified when he went to bed and continued.  Tuesday morning it lightened a bit and then around 11:30 on Tuesday it withdrew; exactly 72 hours from the vaccination. The patient felt okay now, except he was kind of exhausted and had a hungover feeling, not totally clear but he was walking around.   The patient felt if a person had been intoxicated or on medication or had a heart condition, he did not think they would survive this. The patient was physically challenged to get through it with shallow breathing, really panting, and not being able to get around. The patient had to focus on his breathing, panting to get through it. It was serious for him. Initially he noticed the change in his pulse rate and kept checking his pulse. His normal is usually 60 but in this case, it was 56 to 60. The anxiety was mild, he was concentrating to keep calm.       The patient stated: &#34;This is a world crisis, a year old and it is not ideal conditions but this might be a critical issue in terms of the negative effects being more severe than anticipated for certain groups of people and he wanted to discuss this concern with someone at Pfizer.&#34;  The patient added he wanted to make sure that Pfizer knew that the intensity of the experience was a 100, it was very extreme. The patient added he felt like in his eye sockets and in his neck and everywhere that there was something in him, some unfamiliar sensation that has now gone away. When he bent over yesterday, he was mindful that that the dizziness had gone away. The patient added he still felt tired. The patient mentioned he did not eat for a while with that dizziness. The patient was scheduled for the next dose on 19Feb2021 but was a little unsure about getting it.     Follow-up (05Feb2021): New information reported from a contactable consumer includes: suspect vaccine (lot number; anatomical location, vaccination facility, Time), concomitant medications, reaction data (added events: Headache, Anxiety, Shallow breathing, Pulse abnormal, Exhaustion, Abnormal breathing, Feeling abnormal, Activities of daily living impaired, Body height decreased), outcomes updated and clinical course.

                                                a specific disease where things in time-space was not adding up/something not right with time frame; having bouts, what the reporter  thinks are slight hallucinations; &#34;floaty&#34; feeling/ feeling of being &#34;trapped&#34; as he was trying to exit the latrine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer reported for her husband.  A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 27Jan2021 13:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Facility where the COVID-19 vaccine was administered: Other. The patient&#39;s medical history included stroke, blood pressure high (HBP), diabetes (Non-Insulin Dependent) and known allergies to medications, food, or other products: Lisinopril, Penicillin. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took lisinopril and experienced drug allergy. The reporter&#39;s husband (for whom she was reporting) had been having bouts, what she thought are slight hallucinations, since receiving the vaccine. The first (onset of bouts) was twenty-four hours later (28Jan2021) when he described a &#34;floaty&#34; feeling in the morning and was not wanting to get out of bed. Second was forty-eight hours later, on the 29Jan2021, in the morning when he had (as with routine), left his empty water pitcher out for refill (which was per normal), he proceeded to question her about what happened to it and was stating that something was not right with the time frame of events. Thirdly, he had a feeling of being &#34;trapped&#34; as he was trying to exit the latrine on the 31Jan2021 (early hours of the morning). He at that point referenced a specific &#34;disease&#34; where things in time-space was not adding up. Before the vaccine, he was doing fine. After receiving this first dose, it seems to the reporter that he was suffering a reaction contrary to the general side effects. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.
