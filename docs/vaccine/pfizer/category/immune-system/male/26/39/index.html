                                                I would like to start out by saying that I am well aware that this vaccine is known to cause side effects and that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh any side effects induced by it. The reason I am writing this is to provide information that you all can keep in mind as you provide guidance on your recommendations for the timing of when the vaccine should be administered to those who have already tested positive for COVID. I tested positive for COVID-19 11 days prior to getting vaccinated. My symptoms from the virus began on 12/21/20, lasted until 12/26/20 and included: mild headache, fever of 100.3, moderate muscle fatigue, lymphadenopathy, and sinus congestion. I received the Pfizer vaccine on 1/3/21 at 11am and by 2am on 1/4/21 I was experiencing a temperature of 102.5, severe headache, severe muscle fatigue, and painful right axillary lymphadenopathy. Although they had almost completely resolved by 11am on 1/4/20, I would describe these side effects to the vaccine as significantly worse than the symptoms of the virus itself. As someone who has a stronger medical background than the general public (I am a 4th year dental student in a patient-facing role and was encouraged by my school to receive the vaccine despite already testing positive), I understood the likelihood of developing side effects to the vaccine and I am still planning on receiving my second dose in three weeks despite already showing clear signs of a strong immune response to the proteins created by the vaccine. The reason why I am writing this is because there was no guidance on recommending that I wait longer than 10 days between testing positive and receiving the vaccine and I am worried that if the general public is allowed to receive the vaccine at this same time interval, there will be a significant number of people who will have similar side effects (worse than those induced by the virus itself) and they will not only refuse a second dose, but could also vocally discourage many people from trusting the vaccine?s safety and benefit. I obviously don?t know what minimum timeframe should be recommended, but from my individual experience, 11 days was not sufficient. I will be happy to follow up if you would like to know how the symptoms fare after my second dose.

Took 50mg of benadryl shortly after and symptoms improved over the following hour.

                                                Approximately 57 hours after receiving 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine, I developed hive patches throughout my body. I took 50 mg Benadryl and went to bed. Work up the next morning to observe some res spots, but minimal itching. I reported to work, where I am an EMT for an ambulance service. During shift, at approximately 1500 hours, I had a patient who was cold, so I cranked up the heat in the back of the ambulance. I started to sweat. My hive then came back with a vengeance all over my body. I immediately took 50 mg Benadryl and went to the urgent care center. The doctor told me to continue with the Benadryl and to pick up a prescription of Prednisone if symptoms worsen. Symptoms where mostly cleared up at that point. I got off shift at 1900. Hive worsened at approximately 2000. I picked up the prednisone and intend to begin taking it in the morning if symptoms are not much improved.

I called e-medicine and had a video call with a E-Medicine provider who told me to keep monitoring my symtoms and go to the ER if they got worse (fortunately they didn&#39;t); however there are some lingering effects. Currently I still am experiencing headaches (around my ears and temple area) with joint pain/body aches and occasional tingling/burning sensations in my fingers and feet.

On the morning of 1/8 I woke up with noted chills and headache.  I checked my temp and noticed 100.4* oral temp.  I also had back pain, muscle pain, headaches, continued fever (improved with motrin) and chills. My left arm from my shoulder to my wrist was with noted pain/aches, improved with motrin. On the morning of 1/9 I felt much better, did not take any motrin/tylenol and without any fever/chills.  Noted improvement of muscle aches in general and arm felt  the same as 1/7 (much better!).  Noted lymph swelling of my axillary lymph nodes with aching pain.  This has not gone away at current but improved with x1 dose of motrin.

A 28-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine), intramuscularly on 31Dec2020 in arm at a single dose to prevent COVID. There were no medical history or no concomitant medications. He confirmed he is the physician and the primary doctor for the patient. The patient is a pharmacist and he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on 31Dec2020. The next day (01Jan2021), he woke up with a 5-minute interval of indiscernible burning sensation on his face and upper torso that went away after about 5 minutes. The patient reported being hot for a few seconds after taking the Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient came in to contact with some with coronavirus and then the patient tested positive for coronavirus on 17Jan2021 with a PCR test. He had no symptoms since a week after his initial exposure to coronavirus. No adverse reactions but turned up with infection. The outcome of event burning sensation on the face and upper torso was recovered on 01Jan2021, outcome of the other events was unknown.   Reporter assessed seriousness for burning sensation on face and upper torso: Medically significant. Causality between burning sensation on face and upper torso and bnt162b2 was related by Primary Source Reporter per Global Introspection.         Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information , Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is most likely related to an intercurrent condition which is not related to the suspected drug. Based on the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of other events cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I felt palpitations around 10-12 minutes after the 1st Pfizer dose was given, and asked the Doctor to take my vital signs. I had an elevated blood pressure reading and the doctor told me stay in the monitoring area. My blood pressure was taken two more times and was increasing each time. My Blood Pressure went up to 168/98, and was told to lay down on the gurney. When I tried to get up from my seat I became extremely dizzy and sat back down. They put me on a wheelchair to transfer me onto the gurney. As I was laying down I experienced waves of diaphoresis, dizziness, headaches. My head felt cloudy and just lightheaded. I was being monitored for 1 1/2 hour before I was picked up to go home. I continued to have these symptoms for the rest of the night along with arm soreness on the site that I was injected on. I did not experience the same symptoms the next day, but I did have a lingering headache till Saturday (12/26/2020) afternoon.

                                                Starting the day after I got flu like symptoms. Headache, night sweats, chills. Starting last night, after sweating an obscene amount, I started feeling dizziness. Not a normal dizziness, but a severe one with brain zaps. The type of brain zaps someone has when coming on or off affexor/venlafaxine (which I?m currently on). The dizziness only happens when I stand and the brain zaps happen more frequently than when the dose changes or is forgotten with the snri. Before someone asks... yes... I?m taking my affexor properly and haven?t changed how I?m taking it since my covid shot.

A few days later I noticed some red bumps on my stomach and back area only. The bumps seem to be staying the same, they do not itch and are not in any kind of specific pattern. I do not have any other major symptoms. The rash is not painful, not hot, and i do not believe it was due to anything else.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. The patient experienced swelling in left arm/thumb and numbness from tip of thumb to joint on opposite limb of administration.  Since Wednesday, 23Dec2020, he has been experiencing some numbness in the arm opposite of where the vaccine was administered. He clarifies the vaccine was administered in the deltoid of his right arm, and the numbness he is experiencing is in his left hand. His thumb has been partially numb since last Wednesday. He got a little bit of tingling in his left arm since last Wednesday (23Dec2020).The patient explains on Tuesday, 22Dec2020, when he was administered the vaccine he only had typical side effects that went away within 24 hours. He experienced headache and muscle soreness in the arm the vaccine was administered. Both of these symptoms went away and he has recovered completely. After 24-36 hours, he noticed numbness on hand opposite of the arm where the vaccine was administered. His thumb has been partially numb which has lasted about 6 days. He clarifies the numbness is on the palm side- which he was told was not related to the nerve. His thumb looks swollen and inflamed compared to the other. He also has noticed muscle weakness in the opposite arm. The patient states he can&#39;t recall if the numbness occurred within 24 hours but he knows by 24 hours, he did have the numbness. His thumb is partially numb on the side of the palm and up to the middle of his thumb where the joint is.Patient states yesterday the numbness was noticeably worse when he was sleeping. However, today the numbness seems to be back where it was before. He forgets about the numbness since he is not actively doing anything with that particular hand, but he doesn&#39;t forget about it completely. The numbness hasn&#39;t improved any, it&#39;s been consistently there and never went away. While reading off of his card, the patient cannot determine if the Lot number is an F or an E because the number is underlined. He thinks it might be an E. Patient was able to confirm the Lot number begins with an E after looking at the information sheet he was provided. He also sees the product number, CVX 208. Patient states he has no allergic reactions and nothing that he knows of that is an underlying condition. Patient states he hasn&#39;t had any testing done in regards to these events. He wanted to talk to the manufacturer and report it to the (Contact center name) first before he schedules something at Urgent Care. He wanted to check and see if what he is experiencing is a lesser known symptom. He couldn&#39;t find this information anywhere. The outcome of events, headache and muscle soreness was recovered on 23Dec2020. The outcome of Numbness in hand was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

This neurologic diagnosis was not reported by the patient during the consent process with the COVID19 vaccination center staff.  Confirmed following review of the consent form.  Documentation from Emergency Department Provider:  Patient is serially reassessed following treatment for anaphylaxis.  Patient has significant improvement in diffuse erythema and hives within 20 minutes.  He has gradual improvement in his sensation of throat swelling.  He is observed while in the emergency department serially over 4 hours with no recurrence of symptoms.  He does not require any repeat dose of epinephrine and feels at baseline.  Discussed my suspicions that patient may have had a reaction to COVID-19 vaccine as he has had no other new medications or exposures that he is aware of.  As he will not be receiving another vaccine there is nothing to necessarily stay away from.  Make sure he notifies individuals about this for any new vaccine should he receive them.  Patient is observed for sufficient time but discussed possibility for biphasic reaction.  Recommend he return should he have recurrence of symptoms.  Recommend he take EpiPen as prescribed for any throat swelling or progressive shortness of breath.  Recommend follow-up with a primary care provider for this visit..

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. On 28Jan2021 at 07:00, the patient experienced swollen lymph nodes. The patient stated that the lymph nodes were swollen on both sides (or so he thought, as he couldn&#39;t see the uvula at all). The patient stated, &#34;it looks about the same right now&#34;, but the pain (onset: Jan2021) has decreased. The patient stated he had taken several COVID-19 tests prior to the vaccination, on unspecified dates, all negative. The last test, a nasal swab was on Jan2021 with negative results. The clinical outcome of &#34;swollen lymph nodes/lymph nodes are swollen on both sides&#34; and pain was resolving.

He was not falling over but had to be very careful with his steps.; burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back; he felt off. It is hard to explain.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 34-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux, gout, anxiety depression. Ongoing Concomitant medication included allopurinol from Dec2020 for Gout, fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) at 20mg daily from Dec2020 2 weeks ago for Anxiety depression, omeprazole from Dec2020 3 weeks ago for Acid reflux (esophageal), calcium carbonate (TUMS ANTACID) from 2019 as needed for acid reflux. He experienced some unusual side effects that were not listed on the web. His boss advised him to call. Within a few minutes on 31Dec2020 after getting the vaccine he was feeling like he was going to pass out but didn&#39;t. His throat was really dry within 10-15 minutes on 31Dec2020.  He was very shaky. He was not falling over but had to be careful with his steps. After getting the vaccine you have to sit and be monitored for 15 minutes. After that he was ok enough. He thought this was an expected reaction. He usually reacted to things though he didn&#39;t know why. He did fine with the flu shot. He had burning sensation like a really bad acid reflux in chest that went to his back on 31Dec2020. His throat was no different compared to like when you were going to get sick. He had drank a ton of water and his throat was still dry. He was not shaky but he felt off. It was hard to explain. Investigation assessment was no. The outcome of shaky and feeling like he was going to pass out was recovered on 31Dec2020, of dry throat was not recovered, of burning sensation was recovering, of others was unknown.   Information on Lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                About 2 hours after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine I felt a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot, not unlike stepping in a bucket of warm water. The sensation lasted about 5 seconds and disappeared on its own. Since then, about once per hour I have had the same symptom, with a warm, flushed feeling in my left foot. There is no pain, slight numbness and tingling, but no loss of function or coordination. I can sense that the symptom is about to begin approximately 10 seconds before it starts, because my foot begins to feel swollen. This has occurred about 40-50 times since the injection, and has only gone down slightly in frequency over the past 72 hours, currently it is happening about once every 1.5-2 hours.

Second shot same as above but starting 24 hours after vaccine I developed left axillary pain. Able to palpate a lymph node ~1cm. Very painful on palpation. Has not limited activity but still painful. Was difficult to fall asleep  2 nights after vaccine. Now day 2 after vaccine still hurts, maybe incrementally better but taking ibuprofen. Cannot palpate significant lymphadenopathy otherwise.  No fever. I am a physician.

It stated to go away, but never fully dissipated. The next morning while getting ready for work, I noticed I could not taste anything, and mouth felt a bit numb. Also had some residual facial numbness.

                                                Started with tingling of the tongue and itchiness of the arms. I took 50mg of Benadryl immediately, but then progressed to hives all over on my, arms, trunk, eyes, ears, and scalp, and legs. Went to the emergency room in case it got worse or obstructed my breathing. In the ER continued to have itching and extreme redness of my arms, with some swelling of my arms as well. About an hour later the Benadryl began working and received prednisone and Pepcid. Stayed in the ER for another hour and my symptoms mostly resolved. Was prescribed 3 days of 40mg prednisone and given an epipen. Have not had issues since then.

A 35-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EL1283), via intramuscular on the left arm, on 21Jan2021 at 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient had no allergies to medications, food, or other products. No history of allergic reactions to any meds (medication) in the past or other vaccines in childhood. Otherwise young healthy male with no history of hypertension. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: EJ1686) via intramuscular on the left arm on 30Dec2020 at 16:00 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced severe elevation of blood pressure.

The blisters have opened leaving behind painful ulcers. This is not a rash that disappears in a few days. It will take much longer than that to heal. No rash with the first dose. Also, with both doses, had severe elevation of blood pressure as high as 180/100 within 2 to 5 hours on 22Jan2021, requiring about 3 doses of clonidine over 7 days where bp would cycle up and down. The seriousness of the events was reported as non-serious. Since the vaccination, the patient has been not tested for COVID-19. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events and included Benadryl, mometasone cream and clonidine. The outcome of the events was reported as recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

I woke up today, 01/12/2021 and had pain and swelling in my right arm pit. I went to my employer&#39;s employee health services and was checked out by a provider. I was told that he didn&#39;t see anything, and he minimized my symptoms. He didn&#39;t seem like he wanted to evaluate me from the time he walked in the exam room. He told me &#34;what do you want us to do? It looks normal.&#34; He then went on to tell them he&#39;s not going to give me time off for work aside from today. I did not ask for any time off once during the evaluation. I recheck my arm pit when I got home, and noticed the swelling is approx. 3&#34;x 3&#34;s. It was not hard to see when I rechecked. I have noticeable pain the swollen area as well. The swelling is visible when I extend my right arm all the way up above my head. I attempted to tell the employee health provider this, but he preferred to check in a manner that does not show the swelling. I am slightly muscular and when my arm is down, you can only feel soft tissue. Employee health gave me Ibuprofen to treat my Sx&#39;s.  I called my primary physician&#39;s office and am waiting for a call back to be either scheduled for an evaluation or receive medical advice.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

Medical history included ADHD.  Concomitant medication included amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL) and escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO). On an unspecified date, the patient stated that on first vaccine, it made him feel a little sluggish, tired and foggy minded.

Everything is in the middle of the upper arm.  The itchiness and prolonged soreness are my concerns, considering I still need a 2nd dose.

                                                Officially I fainted, but I describe in detailed events of occurrence below.  I was using my laptop doing some busy work while I waited the 15 minutes after taking the first shot of the Pfizer/BT Vaccine. I had the feeling that I could feel the vaccine coursing through my chest but I thought that was irrational and my mind and nerves playing tricks.   I continued to work and let my mind wander for a moment. Next thing I know I was dreaming for a time and then I slowly awakened by the staff calling my name asking &#34;are you OK, do you know where you are?&#34;   I was able to answer correctly, but my mind felt fuzzy/foggy where I felt as if I was running on automatic but my conscious mind was not in full control. At the time, It was hard to describe at the time how I was feeling as I was trying to note it down for future reference. All I could put down were simple words and I could not form full statements. Though I was very present in the moment. I can remember the name of the Nurses who I was talking to, and what we were talking about.  They took me to be observed for about an hour longer. While I waited, I felt warm, especially in the areas of the back of my head and chest. I was not in any pain, but I was very thirsty. I was also getting pretty hot sitting there, but that may be because of the fact the ER Triage room has full glass wall in full sun. At the end of the hour the sun dropped lower in the sky I felt the normal cold refrigerated Hospital I am used to. I felt weak initially but by an hour I had regained most of my strength by the time the triage nurse took my vitals. After the physician looked over me and my report, they did not give me a reason of concern that would warrant keeping me and let me go home to rest.

A few minutes after the shot, I felt a warm wave come over me , kind of felt like passing out but didn&#39;t, heart started racing and hands became clammy/shaky.  I sat down and after a few minutes it passed so I went back to work.  On 1/5/2021 I started to become slightly dizzy with a mild headache lasting all day.  On 1/6/2021 dizziness and slight headache persisted with slightly blurred vision.  On 1/7/2021 I felt slightly better in the morning but as the day went on the dizziness returned with slight headache and blurry vision.  At approximately 16:00 hours I was speaking with my NP,  and went over my symptoms.  She suggested getting my blood pressure taken.  It registered at 154/115.  I called my PCP and I was able to be seen the same day.  I was given clonidine and it came down but on morning of 1/8/2021 it was back up getting as high as 160/120.  Called my PCP back and he prescribed Olmesartan.  It seems to have stabilized my BP but he is unsure why the vaccine has caused this and why it is persisting.

A 38-years-old male patient started to receive 1st dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL0142, Expiry Date: 01Mar2021), via an unspecified route of administration at Left arm on 30Dec2020 18:17 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. There were no concomitant medications. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was reported as &#39;None&#39; and AEs following prior vaccinations was reported as &#39;None&#39;. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was reported as None. The patient experienced really bad chills, body aches, fever, unable to sleep on 31Dec2020 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, passed out on bathroom floor for 5-10 seconds, sweating and neck was stiff on 01Jan2021 with outcome of recovered on 01Jan2021, headache on an unspecified data with outcome of unknown.  Details were as follows: the patient received the Covi-19 vaccine 30Dec2021. He had a reaction to the vaccine. 24 hours after getting the vaccine he had really bad chills, body aches, fever 100.4. He didn&#39;t take any medication for a bit. He then took acetaminophen (TYLENOL). He had a headache, he was unable to sleep. The acetaminophen worked and he went to bed. At 5:00 am he started having a bad headache and took Ibuprofen. He woke up to go to the bathroom. He passed out for 5-10 seconds in the bathroom. His head was leaning in the wall by the door. He was sweating and was stiff all over. He went to the Emergency Room on 01Jan2021. They did an X-ray and a CT scan. They gave him 100ml of saline and some pills. They also did some lab work. Everything was negative. They assumed his body couldn&#39;t handle the vaccine. He was supposed to have received the second shot yesterday (20Jan2021). Employee Health said his Primary Care Physician would have to make the decision on him taking it or not. His doctor said he would have to do more research with Pfizer before he says if he can take it or not. Emergency Room visit required due to event passing out.

My doctor thought two weeks was two long of a delay for the reaction to be from the vaccine. My doctor thought it might have been some antibiotics I had been on and they gave me prednisone. The prednisone cleared up the reaction before the second shot. I received the second shot (on 18Jan2021 with lot no. EK9231, intramuscular on right arm) and within two hours I had an even worse systematic allergic reaction that is still on going as of today 04Feb2021. The Prednisone is not clearing up the reaction.

                                                Approximately 30 minutes after the injection I felt myself get very flushed and slightly lightheaded.  This feeling lasted for about 45 minutes before resolving.  Had right shoulder pain start about 1-2 hours after the vaccine and it steadily increased to the point where it was too painful to move in certain ways that utilized that muscle.  I had to assist my right arm with my left when needing to move it in certain ways between 12-36 hours after the vaccine was received.  The pain dissipated to manageable levels after 48 hours post vaccination and resolved completely after about a week.  Also experienced significant fatigue that started 3-4 hours after the vaccination.  the first night after the vaccination I slept for 12 hours and the second night I slept for 10 hours.  I was still able to go to work which does not involve too much labor and alot of computer work.  Once home I did essentially nothing except rest on the couch or in bed.  When I woke up on the third day the fatigue was mostly gone.  It was completely resolved on the 4th day.

A 39-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EK5730), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Dec2020 at single dose for prevention.  Medical history included none. There were no concomitant medications. Caller states, he received the covid vaccine 19Dec2020 and on 25Dec2020 he was experiencing left facial numbness, b/l foot numbness, b/l hand numbness on 26Dec2020, right side burning on 28Dec2020, Today (29Dec2020) he has had left thigh burning, and Left b/l gluteal burning and paresthesia. No motor issues and no tendon issues, all intact. Also had mid back burning on 28Dec2020 that comes and goes. He has heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus and/or with the vaccine and wants more information on that. Curious if anyone has anything similar? and makes mention of possible Gillian Barre Syndrome. States that he has had a potential reaction. He had his dose on 19Dec2020. On 25Dec2020 he developed left facial numbness, then later that day he developed bilateral foot numbness. On 26Dec2020, he developed bilateral hand numbness, on 28Dec2020 he developed right thigh burning, and today (29Dec2020) he has developed left thigh burning, and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia. States that he has been kind of freaking out about it. He doesn&#39;t have any motor issues. States that he heard that there is a described neuropathy with the virus, but not with the vaccine, is that true? The left facial numbness resolved on either 26Dec2020 or 27Dec2020. States that the symptoms were concerning because it could have been a stroke. States his symptoms were moderate. States that due to the bilateral foot and hand numbness, he had a LP, brain and spine MRI, and blood work done on 26Dec2020. All came back completely normal. When asked about causality, caller states that it makes the most sense for his symptoms to be caused by the vaccine due to his age and the fact that all his testing was completely normal. Reporter seriousness for left facial numbness, bilateral foot numbness, bilateral hand numbness, right thigh burning, left thigh burning and bilateral gluteal burning and paresthesia: Medically significant. The outcome of the event left facial numbness was recovered in Dec2020. The outcome of the events guillain barre syndrome, stroke and mid back burning was unknown. The outcome of the other events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship the association between the reported serious adverse events with BNT162b2 can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.
