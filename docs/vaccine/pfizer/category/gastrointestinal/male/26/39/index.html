                                                Diarrhea; Belching/burping; Significant abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program received from a contactable consumer (reported for himself). A 27-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL0140; expiry date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

Significant abdominal pain was the first symptom he had. Significant abdominal pain and nausea went away and came back in waves. He had not vomited since midnight. The patient experienced diarrhea which started 07:00 this morning (15Jan2021). Now (15Jan2021), he was burping, it was like weird belching. He wanted to know if these were normal side effects from the vaccine. He was looking at the list and saw nausea as a listed potential side effect, but he did not see diarrhea, vomiting. Therefore, he was calling to see if it is plausible these events were related to the COVID vaccine. The patient di not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 15Jan2021; outcome of the events nausea, diarrhea, and significant abdominal pain was not recovered; and outcome of event belching/burping was unknown.

Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

A 31-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included ongoing HIV since 2015. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). The patient reported that he received his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last Monday (11Jan2021) between 8:00 am and 8:30 am, and since then he has been sick and has been experiencing some side effects. He mentioned that he has been in contact with someone who is Covid-19 positive on an unspecified date. He works at the front desk registration in a hospital. He has been tired and fatigued, has had a low-grade fever, vomiting, headache, cough and chest tightness. He added that on Monday evening (11Jan2021), he became tired and fatigued. He had an on and off fever on Tuesday (12Jan2021). He started vomiting while coughing on 12Jan2021. He went to the doctor last night (13Jan2021) and he said he got tested for Covid-19 on 13Jan2021, but the results came out negative. The physician said that it would. However, his physician said that it was too early to tell if he has been infected since he has just been exposed last Monday. Normally, they like to have a 5 day turn around for a true reading. He said his physician told him he just needed to quarantine. He mentioned that his chest feels tight when he coughs on 13Jan2021. When he had to take deep breaths while the doctor was listening to him breath his chest was tight. He had blood work drawn at the doctor&#39;s office, but he does not have any results to provide. The patient wanted to know what he needs to do about this. He was inquiring if there any recommendations. He is probably negative because he is symptomatic. His employer said it may be a reaction from the shot. The outcome of the events sickness and exposure to COVID-19 were unknown, as for the event vomiting was recovered on 12Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.    The following information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

                                                First dose of vaccine received on 12/18/20: no adverse reaction, felt great Second dose of vaccine received Thursday night, 1/7/21: no adverse reaction that night but woke up with sore L arm in the morning. So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen. Same symptoms on Saturday with increase in intensity, plus mild fever in the evening at 99.6 F (instead of 97.4 F which is &#34;my normal&#34;), nausea, painful eye balls, sensitivity to light and noise, loss of appetite. Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

                                                2nd dose administered Thursday Jan 14th @ 2pm. Symptoms started  Friday Jan 15th  @ 0630 am. Became extremely lightheaded/dizzy. Became nauseous. Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

                                                Had severe reaction to the vaccine not necessarily adverse events but still wanted to report it. I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

In the morning, when he woke up, he felt dizzy and had severe muscle aches and pain all over his body, felt like a sunburn all over his back. His skin and arm were very sore. He took a shower and lost his balance twice in the shower because he was dizzy. He was able to make it to work. At work, he started having a headache. It started to get worse. The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol. He took two 500mg tablets again. He didn&#39;t have any energy sitting at his desk doing nothing. He was not able to look at his computer because of the headache. He could not work on 08Jan2021. He left work and got home and was having headache on the ride home. When he got home, he didn&#39;t have appetite. He ate a banana and an orange. He felt like his body was getting warm and had heat over his eye. His temp was 100.8. last night on 07Jan2021. Headache started on 07Jan2021 and he continued to have headache.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

His head was hurting so bad that it was more than a migraine and he was vomiting, body ache but way worse than anyone that he has ever talked to, that has had it. He had to go to the hospital for it, it was bad.&#34; The reporter stated that the date of hospitalization was &#34;yesterday 26Jan2021.&#34; The reason for hospitalization was not confirmed further. When asked about the outcome of the events the reporter stated, &#34;A little bit better but not much&#34;.

A 39-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), on an unspecified date (dose number= 1, lot number: EK5730) then on 06Jan2021, 11:30 (dose number= 2, lot number: EL3248), both at a single dose, via an unspecified route of administration (anatomical location: Arm Left) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced fatigue few hours after the second vaccine (06Jan2021) followed by fever, chills and nausea/vomiting. The latter lasted about 6 hours but was horrible. Treatment received for the adverse event were paracetamol (TYLENOL) and ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The outcome of the events was recovered on Jan2021.
