A 26-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EK9231; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. He received his first dose (age of vaccination was 26-year-old) of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EH9899; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s family history included his father has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine in a university hospital which set up a clinic. The patient reported that he thought he got his second dose last night at about 8 pm and since then in the morning around 8 am, so about 12 hours after he started having flu like symptoms that got pretty bad one point. He took some acetaminophen (TYLENOL) so it has gotten better but he was having myalgia, headache, fever, chills and nausea. The patient further mentioned that first, he started having chills around 8 am in the morning. He had chills before but now he kind of overheated and now he is not under a blanket anymore, so he thinks that is improved. He then started having nausea, then myalgia and then everything kind of got bad all at once. He mentioned that over all everything has improved except the headache. He further added that everything has not gone away complete but improved significantly. Earlier today (14Jan2021) like 2-3 hours ago he would say it was a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10 but right now it is about 4 on a scale of 0-10 and that goes for everything. He does not think anything else is confounding, he is not on any medications and has no chronic health problems, there has been no labs drawn. The patient did not visit an emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the outcome of the event headache was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                About half an hour after receiving 2nd dose, I started to feel a little nauseous and my throat felt like it was tightening a bit. It was nothing too major, but I did call paramedics to monitor me. The episode subsided about a half hour after that.  However, I did have a more severe episode a few days later on March 5th, in which I had to receive urgent care. It was shortly after lunch which included a spicy hot sauce I had a little bit of.  I started having a similar reaction as earlier described, which eventually subsided once at the doctors office for a bit. However, it did lead to a panic attack, which is something I had never had before.  Overall, I had never reacted like this before. I am wondering if one the side effects of the vaccine may be causing it.

                                                The night after receiving the shot, I had a fever and began experiencing body ache, headache and chills.  Following that I woke up in the night experiencing auditory hallucinations and delusions.  The following day I was exhausted, had a low grade fever, and that night I continued to experience night terrors and delusions.  A few days after getting the vaccine I began experiencing unusual digestive problems, going from extremes of eating large quanities of food (3000-4000 calories a day) to not feeling hungry and barley eating anything at all.  I have still experienced night terrors, nightmares as well as delusions and hallucinations almost every night since getting the vaccine.  The symptoms are starting to occur during the daytime as well when I am fully awake.

                                                This RPH was called to assist patient at 11:27a. Patient stated he felt dizzy and I assisted patient to the floor. Once laying on floor I elevated patient&#39;s feet above his head. By stander reported that patient appeared to have blacked out right before I arrived on scene. Patient stayed upright in chair during blackout which only lasted a few seconds.  Patient stated he did eat breakfast but had not slept due to working overnight. Patient was assisted to sitting position on floor at 11:33a at which time he drank a bottle of water. After finishing bottle of water he stated he felt dizzy again and I assisted him back to a laying position on floor.  After 10 minutes I assisted patient back to a sitting position. After sitting for a few seconds patient stated he felt like he would get sick. Before I could return, patient vomitted on himself and over the floor. Patient continued to vomit/dry heave into trashcan for a few minutes. After patient was done getting sick, he drank another bottle of water. He sat for a few minutes prior to standing. At this time patient&#39;s mother-in-law had arrived at store to take patient home. Patient wanted to leave store immediately as he felt it was making him more uncomfortable due to current condition. Patient left store approximately 12p.

                                                I developed stomach cramps and discomfort, paired with some diarrhea. I also developed the worst heartburn/acid reflux I have ever experienced. Normally if I get heartburn it?s after a meal, but this was constant throughout the day and night. I am still feeling the heartburn, although it seems it?s not as bad as before. I also developed the worst depression and anxiety of my life. It hit me Friday, April 9 like a bag of bricks. I started crying out of nowhere. I have had intense depression since. The anxiety has been worse than the depression. Pretty much unbearable worry and panic. I have been waking up in the middle of the night around 4 am every night worried. Also when I wake up in the morning I wake up in a panic. The feeling has been terrible and also consistently present.

We had patient slowly sit down on the floor near the counter, a tech got him a cool rag for his neck while pharmacist stayed with him. he started to feel much better after the rag was on his neck for a few minutes and said his vision and hearing was normal again. Denied history of this happening after vaccination. Patient denied any difficulty breathing or swelling of throat/tongue. RPH check bp and it was 95/55, pulse 80. Patient stated he  was at clinic yesterday and was told his bp was on the lower end of normal. Reported feeling a bit nauseous also. We gave him a bag in case he got sick and a small bottle of water. He was able to stand up and walk to a chair to sit down. We asked if he wanted us to call someone and he declined and said he was feeling better. We asked him to stay for 30 minutes more so we could monitor. After 30 minutes he reported the nausea had passed and he  was feeling normal again. He said he was ok to drive home.

It&#39;s hard to breathe without coughing and pain. And the nausea came I had body aches too. But everything else went away except for the nausea which has been haunting me and the difficulty breathing which has limited the amount of work i do at work and has had an impact on my sleeping as well.

However, I have been noticing that ever since I completed the 2 dose series I have been feeling dizzy randomly. First I thought it was normal but now is been months and I constantly feel dizzy. I check my blood pressure and heart rate thinking it may be due to that but they?re usually within normal ranges and the dizziness episodes just come and go throughout the day.

                                                Diarrhea; Belching/burping; Significant abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program received from a contactable consumer (reported for himself). A 27-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL0140; expiry date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient experienced significant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting last night at 14Jan2021 20:00. Significant abdominal pain was the first symptom he had. Significant abdominal pain and nausea went away and came back in waves. He had not vomited since midnight. The patient experienced diarrhea which started 07:00 this morning (15Jan2021). Now (15Jan2021), he was burping, it was like weird belching. He wanted to know if these were normal side effects from the vaccine. He was looking at the list and saw nausea as a listed potential side effect, but he did not see diarrhea, vomiting. Therefore, he was calling to see if it is plausible these events were related to the COVID vaccine. The patient di not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 15Jan2021; outcome of the events nausea, diarrhea, and significant abdominal pain was not recovered; and outcome of event belching/burping was unknown.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

                                                27 year old male received his second shot today and immediately after the shot felt nausea lightheaded and dizzy. He says it feels like the room is spinning around him. He does not have any PMH nor does he state that he takes any medication. He denies any street or illegal drug use. Pt states that he had a couple drinks last night and did not eat anything today. After providing water and laying him down for 30 min he was still symptomatic so it was decided that the patient should be seen in the ED for further workup. Patient is in agreement and he will be sent.   148/101, P 92, O2% 99% 150/101, P 90  ED Note: Physical exam reveals an alert, normocephalic male he has a normal heart rate with normal heart sounds, normal pulmonary effort, lung sounds are clear abdomen is soft he does have some tenderness in the epigastric area no rigidity or distention is noted.  Patient is neurologically intact he is alert and oriented x3, able to ambulate unassisted with a normal gait, sensation is intact, strength is 5 out of 5 in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally, no pronator drift, cerebellar function intact with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin test.  Posterior oropharyngeal area shows uvula is midline there is no swelling airway is patent.   This is an atypical presentation if the patient is actually having an reaction to the vaccination however I am also concerned for possible abdominal issue we will work him up for ACS as well.  We will give patient a dose of Benadryl to see if that helps with some of his symptoms Bentyl for the stomach cramping and spasming and some fluids.   Lab work was unremarkable patient had a negative troponin&#39;s EKG was negative for STEMI, ischemic changes T wave abnormalities, lactate was normal, lipase was normal.  Patient still complaining of abdominal spasms but states he is feeling better than when he first arrived and would like to go home.  Patient states that his abdominal spasms have happened intermittently over the last few years he has had multiple imaging of his stomach and that he feels comfortable being discharged with the intention that if anything worsens he would return here to the emergency department.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

                                                Beginning twelve hours (8pm) after the 2nd dose I got a severe headache with a high fever of 102 degrees. I took two 325mg tablets of Tylenol around 9:30pm and went to bed. I couldn&#39;t sleep until around 1am when I vomited about 7 times in a row. When I woke up the next day, I still had a lower grade fever that fluctuated and felt sore all over with a headache. I barely had any appetite and all I ate all day was some crackers with peanut butter and a lot of apple juice and water. I took one additional 325mg Tylenol. I slept for about four hours in the middle of the day being exhausted. I took two additional 325mg Tylenol before going to bed at 9:30pm. As of this morning, two days after the shot, I am feeling mostly back to normal. Slight headache and a bit sore but I have an appetite back and am still relaxing.

I thought these were regular side effects and eventually got better.   Then, about a week later I started getting nose bleeds with blood clots coming out of my nose.  These lasted a few more days. This never happened to me before, and must have been a side effect from the vaccine.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

                                                Patient reported chest pain for 2 days and intermittent jaw pain after receiving his second Pfizer COVID vaccine on 4/22, and presented to the ER on 4/25 with a headache and emesis. An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

I appear to have developed a canker sore on my tonsil. Because of the location of it, the tonsil is also agitated and has been bleeding leading me to have black stool as well as cough up blood and an upset stomach. This is something I have never experienced before.  It may be unrelated to the vaccine, I am not sure, but I figured it is something worth reporting.

As I was standing up I notice all of the following-  headaches, body pain, fever, low energy (although this one went away fast). I also felt like puking most of the day. I woke up at 7am and After work I took a nap. I woke up at 7pm feeling a lot better.  I still had some minor headache but it went away with Advil.

                                                After about an hour following my second COVID-19 Injection I began feeling warm.  My forehead felt warmer so I figure I may have had a slight fever at that point.  I received a metallic (Note I say metallic but I know it wasn&#39;t actually metal but that&#39;s simply the best way I can describe the taste I experienced) following the injection about 5 minutes after.  My arm remained sore following and still remains sore as of this report.  I experienced a decline in mental acuity following about an hour after injection.  I began to feel lightheaded and exhausted to the point I was experiencing severe disorientation and confusion.  I was having trouble putting sentences together and experienced a ringing sensation in the ears.  I felt like I wasn&#39;t even present anymore.  I couldn&#39;t comprehend things around me and apparently had conversations I don&#39;t even remember having.  Note that at that point I had gotten home but don&#39;t even remember getting home.  I just know that this did not begin to wear off until around 8:45pm  when it was like someone flipped a switch and I suddenly was coherent again.  It was an odd sensation to experience.  The arm remained sore and the metallic taste returned briefly after this experience.  I experienced a similar feeling from the HPV injection years ago, but just like this it was a temporary thing that resulted in no long term issues.  However, I cannot tell you fully what we did the rest of the day until around 845-9 pm.  I also remember becoming partly agitated after the injection like my body just all of a sudden took notice of something and shot into action.  I had received my allergy injections this same day about two hours earlier as well and none of these reactions ever occur with those for me.  I continued to drink liquid as far as I know as there were a few empty bottles of water next to me.  I have no recollection of getting them.  It&#39;s odd.  There&#39;s just this brief moment in time that is just missing from my memory with a few short bits and pieces that are there like a puzzle with some missing pieces.  I feel I became so fatigued I could not function.  My emotions I remember were off and hard to control during this period too.  I felt like I was having some random mood swings.  I feel ok now though aside from the upset stomach occasionally and the fatigue and arm pain (but even the arm pain has partly decreased now).  It all ceased.  I have a number of health issues outside of this but have not experienced this long of a period of almost intermittent amnesia and incoherency following an injection before.  I believe it made me that much more tired or reacted with one of my many conditions or genetic variants that perhaps may have been part of this.  I&#39;m happy to provide anything I can to help with this.  I am greatly appreciative of all the CDC has done to get us this vaccine and continues to do to ensure our safety both before and after injection.  It is commendable.    I did fill out my survey through the V-Safe portal as well and will continue to follow up there should I have any changes.  I have not sought medical care following this event as the coherency and such have seemed to resolve in regards to the vaccine injection.  Only thing left are known side effects at this point besides an occasional increase in numbness and tingling that I already experience in my legs and feet.  My absolute best guess for the cause is my immune system which already has some issues regulating (doesn&#39;t always like to learn everything it should and we are currently searching for an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder currently going on as well in me) on top of allergy shots today.  it was perhaps just a bit too much demand on it all at once.  But it seems to be balancing out again now.

                                                While waiting in observation my chest began to feel tight and in pain. The symptom lasted around 5 minutes and did not impede my ability to breathe. This concerns me since one of the allergic responses is anaphylaxis and I will need a second vaccination.   Additionally, that night at 8:30 and the following day I have developed a minor headache (5), feel fatigued and tired, slight nausea, and slight aching in my body (3)

Paramedics were called and I was taken to the ER where I was treated with anti-nausea medications and valium to reduce vertigo.  A non contrast CT, blood panel, and stroke assessment were all normal with no sign of ear infection.  I was release from the hospital at 10am on 4/19/2021.    On 4/21/2021 I saw an ENT who performed a hearing exam revealing my right ear is completely deaf with normal left ear function.  The ENT prescribed prednisone 10mg (63 tablets over 10 days).   As of today (4/25/2021) I no longer have vertigo and nausea, but I still have no hearing in my right ear and have significant vestibular challenges and cannot walk safely unassisted without getting dizzy.

                                                Heart pain; Fever; Headache; Stomach ache; Difficulty to sleep; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient).  A 28-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on 03May2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration (at the age of 28-years-old), administered in Arm Left on Apr2021 10:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient experienced the normal symptoms like fever but it was just a mild fever, headache, stomach ache, and difficulty to sleep but the reason he is calling is because he was experiencing heart pain. He received the vaccine for protection on 03May2021 and for all the symptoms he had all started the same day he got the vaccine which all the symptoms started that night. The heart pain was only 10 minutes to 15 minutes that the pain lasted and it was painful but he relaxed himself and the pain went away by itself and he was not scared. He just laid down until the pain relieved and he took no medication. The outcome of the event heart pain was recovered on 03May2021, while for the rest of the events was recovered on 04May2021. The events were considered as non-serious by reporter. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No additional administered vaccines. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Monday felt fevers and chills and malaise all day. Tuesday morning felt some retrosternal chest discomfort that lasted an hour or so and spontaneously went away. Was able to go to work all day and do fine. Works in a garage and lifts heavy tires. Yesterday took kids to day care, felt a little pain that morning which resolved. Picked them up in the evening and was going to hang out with them but had recurrence of pain and this time was quite severe. Tried to take some tylenol but threw this up. Came to the ED and had to wait 1-2 hours to be seen, but the time he was his pain had nearly resolved. Troponin taken around 10000. Cardiology consulted, think this might be reactivation / recurrence of his prior myopericarditis.&#34; H&amp;P 3/24/21  &#34;This is a 28 y.o. male with hx of post-viral myopericarditis in 2013 but otherwise healthy who presents for recurrence of myopericarditis incidentally not long after receiving 2nd COVID vaccine                         # Myopericarditis             Had episode of post-viral myopericarditis back in 2013, at which time he had an elevation of Trop I (non-HS variety) to 7.3 and echo showing basal inferolateral, basal inferior and mid inferolateral wall motion abnormalities but otherwise normal LV function. Has been highly functional. Recently got 2nd COVID vaccine and had fevers/chills after that.             Recurrent chest pain 3/24 w/o provocation, aborted on its own but has trop elevated to 10,000. EKG does not show STEMI and patient actually asymptomatic in ED. No infectious symptoms. Unclear but wonder if COVID vaccine could have caused recurrence of prior myopericarditis? Cards called in ED, they would like him admitted, to treat with colchicine and advil, repeat TTE and they will consult in the morning.&#34; A/P 3/24/21 from admission

                                                On days 1 and 2, I experienced normal symptoms from receiving the vaccine, fatigue, joint and head aches that lasted through the weekend and up to day 5. On day 5, I noticed unilateral lymphedema of my tonsils. On day 7, I went to an Urgent Care but didn&#39;t get much treatment. My condition worsened, I was fatigued, no appetite and thirsty. On day 8, I popped a fever of 103. On day 9, it worsened to the point that it was hard to breathe. I went to the ER on 10 and had a full array of tests. I was treated with dexamethasone and a bolus saline IV. My symptoms went away after treatment around day 14, but the lymphedema lingered for awhile longer.

He was sweating and then proceeded to vomit. We had him sit in the other exam room and gave him some water. After that he started saying his arms were tingling and going numb, when that happened I discussed with him calling EMS and instructed the PCT to call EMS. When EMS came the pt said he was feeling better and signed a refusal to go with them to the ER. The pt had a friend who was in the store with him that was going to drive him home. He was able to sit for about 30  minuets when he stated that he was feeling better and was wanting to go home. PCT walked him to the car. He was instructed that if at any time he started having symptoms again that he needed to go to the ER.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

                                                Pt got the vaccine on 3/17 and called today 3/21 to tell us he was having a reaction. He said his armpit on the same side of the shot (left) started to swell 24 to 36 hours after the shot. He had some edema and pain. The past 2 days, he states that the swelling moved down to his left abdomen. He has no fever, shortness of breath or any other symptom. I referred him to a doctor and he is going tomorrow.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

My throat is/has been red with pus-like pockets on the inside of my throat. In addition to the throat issues, I have been extremely lethargic, with sensitivity to light and sound. I have had all of these symptoms for 6 days now. I also have had lots of diarrhea but that cleared up after 3 or 4 days.

During those 3 days, I had severe body aches and fatigue. I slept 16-18 hour nights and struggled to stay awake. I had hot and cold flashes throughout the evenings from the night of the vaccine and the 2 nights following that (3 nights total). I had a loss of appetite during those 3 days and on day 4 finally started to feel normal.

                                                I received the 1st shot of the pfizer covid vaccine on March 11, 2021. Within 2 days I began to feel extremely fatigued. The days following I experienced night sweats, nausea, extreme fatigue, fever. I went to urgent care with a 102 fever, jaundice, and anemia. Urgent care sent me to the ER. At the ER they admitted me to the hospital. I was in the hospital for 3 days with hemolytic anemia. After a lot of testing and ruling out any infections, they discovered I have a rare blood disorder: hereditary elliptocytosis. The pfizer vaccine created an immune response and since I have this blood disorder I was predisposed to this event occurring from the vaccine (hemolytic anemia/juandice) without knowing it. It was a result of the vaccine. I was told to not get the second shot because there is no guidance, but that I am a high risk individual now. I need medical advice from people who are familiar and know.

That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

                                                20 hours after injection, I started having progressively worsening severe back pain, neck pain, headache, chills (no fever), skin sensitivity, noise sensitivity, fatigue, and brain fog. 2 days after the vaccine, I had abdominal pain, and cough. All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                Patient received his 1 dose of Pfizer vaccine and was waiting in our lobby for the recommended 15 minutes. He fainted after about 10 minutes. He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

I also couldn&#39;t focus and I was experiencing vision problems meaning I had trouble seeing. All these problems I wasn&#39;t experiencing any of them before the ??. I wasn&#39;t watching the time but everything lasted till I made it home and took my pain medication. If more information is needed please feel free to reach out to me.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

I started to have headaches, body aches, chills, feverish feelings, frequent bowel movements, sleepiness, fatigue, and ringing in my ears. It&#39;s been 10 days now and my symptoms continue. I went to an urgent care on 4/4/21. Dr said it was the vaccine working. 4/8/21 I went to urgent care again. Dr said it was very strange that my symptoms continued. Took covid test and was negative. 4/8/21 night I decided to go to the hospital because the symptoms were not getting any better. ER Dr ran tests - X ray, urine test, blood work. Everything came back normal. Dr said my immune system was in overdrive.

I had him sit down in the counseling room. 911 was called and ems was dispatched. in the mean time store management brought him water. I asked the patient again if he was having difficulty breathing and he said no, but he felt dizzy and his heart rate was elevated. I asked him if he had any difficulty swallowing, or any swelling of the lips, tongue, mouth or throat - pt denied all symptoms. patient also denied a rash or any itching when asked. I also asked the patient if he had any nausea, which he stated he did. he continued to deny all symptoms except dizziness, and nausea when asked, and in talking to him while waiting for emt he never displayed any symptoms that would lead me to believe he was having difficulty breathing, or a true allergic reaction. when emt arrived and examined him his pulse, blood pressure and oxygen saturation was normal, and the patient stated he felt better and had a history of anxiety. patient declined to go to the hospital, waited in the pharmacy for a while longer, and had a friend come pick him up

He was wobbly upon standing. We helped patient into bathroom as he still said he needed to vomit. Patient sat down on toilet and rested until he didn&#39;t feel nauseated. Patient stated he was ready to have his blood drawn. As we got him seated in the draw chair, The RN came back in. I explained that the patient became ill from the vaccine after she had left. She asked if he felt better now, he said yes and that was all that was stated/done.

Patient was put on a stretcher, recumbent position. Feelings of lightheadedness/vertigo almost resolved but with every attempt to elevate the head lightheadedness/vertigo returned (over a span of 45 minutes).

                                                I&#39;m really hoping to get some guidance as I seem to be having a very strange reaction to the vaccine. Approximately 2 weeks from my 1st vaccine on 3/16/2021; I had sudden panic attacks. I never had a panic attack or anxiety before. Following the panic attacks, I have been struggling with several major symptoms: no appetite/ loss of appetite, chronic headache(almost daily), GI problems, and most noteworthy, daily inexplicable waves of anxiety and worry.  As mentioned, I have no history of anxiety or panic attacks. I also am experiencing chills, sweating, shaking, and a lot of brain fog/ inability to concentrate. The symptoms did start to subside to some degree, but as of today (4/24/21) I had more sudden and inexplicable rushes of anxiety and panic. Some other symptoms are an elevated resting heart rate and higher than usual blood pressure. I have also been waking from sleep suddenly with a feeling of jitteriness in my chest and palpitations. I have had trouble sleeping and almost feel like a rush of adrenaline hits me right before I start to fall asleep. I received my 2nd vaccine on 4/6/2021 because I didn&#39;t think these could be related to the vaccine. I&#39;m seeing many people online mentioning similar reactions after getting their Pfizer vaccine.

                                                more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine; Purple splotches; Dizzy and woozy; Nausea; Headache; Feels awful/slow motion; Tired; Sluggish; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Given second dose of covid vaccine on friday in the right arm 04/23/2021. The day after the covid vaccine I ran a high fever from about 7:30am until about 9pm on Saturday 04/24/2021.  During Saturday I drank lots of water to combat the fever but I noticed blood in my urine.  The blood got worse through out Saturday into Sunday and I noticed slight pain in my lower back and lower abdomen.  On Sunday morning (04/25/2021) my urine was a dark burgundy color.  This was quite alarming as it was very thick and not as light as the day before.  I drank lots of water on sunday and made sure to watch my urine.  The urine stayed red in color.  I called a telehealth nurse  on Sunday and they suggested I go to Urgent care in the morning.  I woke up on Monday (04/06/2021) with less blood in my urine but still went to urgent care to be safe.  At Urgent care I received a Urine analysis.  The doctor told me there was blood and protein in my urine.  He ruled out a UTI or an STD. The doctor said there may be kidney damage since there is protein present but it cannot be confirmed with the levels. The doctor advised that I continue to drink liquid and watch for worsening signs.  The doctor said I should contact him immediately if the blood or pain gets worse. The doctor also stated I should fill out this VAERS form. Today (04/27/2021) there has been less blood in my urine but there is still some pain in my lower abdomen.  I will contact the doctor at the end of the week to let him know what has happened to my symptoms, he requested I keep him informed.

A 31-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included ongoing HIV since 2015. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). The patient reported that he received his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last Monday (11Jan2021) between 8:00 am and 8:30 am, and since then he has been sick and has been experiencing some side effects. He mentioned that he has been in contact with someone who is Covid-19 positive on an unspecified date. He works at the front desk registration in a hospital. He has been tired and fatigued, has had a low-grade fever, vomiting, headache, cough and chest tightness. He added that on Monday evening (11Jan2021), he became tired and fatigued.

However, his physician said that it was too early to tell if he has been infected since he has just been exposed last Monday. Normally, they like to have a 5 day turn around for a true reading. He said his physician told him he just needed to quarantine. He mentioned that his chest feels tight when he coughs on 13Jan2021. When he had to take deep breaths while the doctor was listening to him breath his chest was tight. He had blood work drawn at the doctor&#39;s office, but he does not have any results to provide. The patient wanted to know what he needs to do about this. He was inquiring if there any recommendations. He is probably negative because he is symptomatic. His employer said it may be a reaction from the shot. The outcome of the events sickness and exposure to COVID-19 were unknown, as for the event vomiting was recovered on 12Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.    The following information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Woke up the next day with mild to severe body aches, muscle soreness, joint pain and pain in my stomach/abdomen. Developed a 101 fever 24 hrs after receiving the vaccine, and continued until this morning (3/16). Vomiting multiple times in the middle of the night on 3/14. The vomiting was only a one night deal, but every other symptom that I experienced has been persistent until this morning. I feel about 80% back at the moment. Symptoms were very similar, maybe even a little more extreme, than the ones I experienced when I contracted Covid months ago, but they didn?t last as long.

I was seen at the nearby emergency room where I underwent an EKG and monitoring until my vitals stabilized about an hour and a half later. Today, 4/29/2021, I am recovered from the severe symptoms and so far I just have a very sore arm, headache, chills, and fatigue.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine, I felt very tired and winded as if I was working out for hours on no food. I did eat that day. I felt dizzy and saw black dots in my vision and felt the need to sit down. I never made it to sit, rather fell flat on my face and passed out for a few moments before my cousin came and picked me up asking what happened. It was very embarrassing and I believe the fall on my face caused an infection in my jawline on the left side and a sinus infection. I was throwing up and blowing my nose from blood. Very scary sight to see.

Massive tension headache and pressure behind eyes and sinus that has lasted so far for 3 weeks, tinnitus, blurred vision, joint pain, muscle weakness, muscle twitching in face and throughout body, numbness in all my limbs, burning sensations on my neck and back, stomach pain, and heart palpitations that sent me to the ER. When I walk and move my arms I feel weak. The vaccine has effected my nervous system in a terrible way. The ER doctor, ENT, PCP, Optometrist, and Opthamologist told me it was inflammation due to the vaccine. I was prescribed 6 days prednisone, 40mg for 2 days then taper down and they put me in a &#34;let&#39;s wait and see&#34; mode. All symptoms have persisted since. I follow-up with a cardiologist on 05/14/2021 and waiting appt for a neuro ophthalmologist.

                                                Immediate onset of L facial weakness/inability to fully close lips on L side (contract muscles) to seal lips when eating/drinking. Evaluated in ER and stroke ruled out by negative head CT and workup. Misdiagnosed as Bell&#39;s palsy, no treatment, told it could take several weeks or months to resolve and to wait it out. Upper lip tight and smile changed. Symptoms persisted and slowly worsened/progressed, overall muscle strength diminished, some bronchospasm issues with heavy exercise. Seen by PCP and allergy doctor and told likely has exercise-induced asthma and still resolving Bell&#39;s palsy. Facial symptoms continued to worsen and began involving his palate, unable to close off sinus passage way, slurred and nasal speech in the evenings, unable to chew and swallow well towards evening. Patient feared he had ALS after researching symptoms, I started to worry it was myasthenia gravis. Saw PCP again who refused to order confirmatory lab work for MG or ALS and referred to neurology. Referral turnaround was not emergent despite several calls and attempts to escalate this issue. Unable to verbally communicate in the evenings, resorted to texting to express needs. Had a scary episode of choking due to inability to swallow, 911 called to home. Sent to ER for workup and finally a neuromuscular disorder was on the differential. Transferred to a higher level of care for on-site neurology where he received IVIG x 5 days and started pyridostigmine for likely myasthenia gravis with rapid improvement in symtoms. Plan is for continued monthly IVIG and then adding an immunosuppressant long-term in addition to his pyridostigmine.

A 31-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/lot number: unknown) via unspecified route of administration on 25May2021 (at the age of 31-years-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history of patient included Achalasia- it means that his esophagus doesn&#39;t work, diabetes because his organs were shutting down, arthritis but it was under control and ten years ago, he had an operation to change his lower valve but it didn&#39;t go well, from 145lbs, his weight decreased to 100lbs. Reporter mentioned that his medical condition might a be part of the issue and it could possibly be interacting negatively with the vaccine. Concomitant medications were none. On an unspecified date, after vaccination, the patient had diarrhea for about a week to the point that he had an ER visit to rehydrate. Patient also had sluggishness, fatigue, fever, and chills for another week. Patient underwent lab tests which included body weight measurements: 145lbs, 100 lbs and 130lbs on unspecified dates. Reporter reported that the patient was almost fully recovered. Reporter wanted to know if his son should get the second dose of the vaccine considering his condition and adverse events and wanted to know the efficacy of the vaccine after 1 dose and also if his son could get another brand of COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of events was recovering.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.  No follow-up attempts are completed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

Pt. states that he was walking to his car after his thirty minutes was up and started to feel the reaction.  After Pt. came back in he was instructed to sit down, and it was determined that Pt. throat was swelling. Pt. took 50mg of his own benadryl orally.

Pt. was given 0.3 of Epi in his left arm.  Pt. stated that his throat was starting to improve five minutes after injection.  Pt. care was transferred to Ambulance without incident.

I have been to primary care and neurologists, no concrete answer on cause or treatment. This vaccine is the only different thing I did since I work from home during weekdays.  Nausea has tapered off but balances issues still prevalent and difficulty in walking in a straight line and driving. Vertigo medicines are of no help either

Medical exam by primary said my thyroid is a bit full.  Some post nasal drip as well.  Discomfort from the swelling became gradually more significant over several days.  Some tightness when swallowing food.   At this time of year I typically get allergy symptoms of hay fever (sneezing, itch/watery eyes, etc.) but neck swelling has never been a symptom for me.  Started taking Claritin once a day as I usually do this time of year as well.

In the late night of 26th Apr while I was sleeping, suddenly I felt serious gastric problems. It also felt like heartburn. I walked around 2 hours in my apartment in the late night. I had plenty of water also. I had to take some Coke to burp up the gas.  After ~2 to 3 hours, I relaxed. Maybe this is not a serious adverse event, but as a responsible person, I had to share my experience.

                                                I had one large cup of coffee with cream and 3 doughnuts for breakfast approximately 3 hours before the vaccine. I took one Claritin Readitab approximately 2 hours before my vaccine injection to help with pollen allergies.   I was seated during the vaccine injection.  The injection was delivered into upper left arm. I felt fine at first. I stood and exited the room and began speaking with the pharmacist that had delivered the invention to receive instructions. Approximately 2-5 minutes after I received the injection I began to feel dizzy. After approximately 1 minute of dizziness I sat down.  I began to get extremely dizzy to the point of faintness. I noticed during this time that I was getting very sweaty. My skin over my whole body seemed to me to be damp from sweat and where I checked I was sweating visibly (no droplets formed? it was just dampness). At the same time I experienced nausea. I believed that I might throw up, so I requested something to throw up into. I never threw up. I continued to get more and more dizzy and I had trouble remaining upright (while seated). A woman observing me stated afterward that my eyes rolled back and that I fainted. I do not believe that I actually fainted because I remember hearing her tell the pharmacist that I had passed out. I had my eyes closed though, so it is possible that I fainted briefly.  The pharmacist called 911. I began to feel better approximately 15 minutes after receiving the vaccine. I stopped sweating, and then the nausea subsided, and then my dizziness cleared up.   The EMTs arrived approximately 20 minutes after I received the vaccine and took my blood pressure. I do not remember the reading, but the EMT stated that it was not elevated. My blood oxygen was 99%. The EMT waited about 10 minutes and took my blood pressure again. He stated that it was higher, but not concerning. The EMT waited another 10-15 minutes and then left. Before he left, the EMT stated to me that I was one of 2 concurrent calls regarding adverse vaccine responses.   After this event I drank a bottle of  water. It did not seem to have an impact.   I have not received vaccinations since I was a child. I do not remember adverse reactions to injections when I was a child. I did pass out when giving blood approximately 12 years ago. I have always attributed this to the fact that I did not eat or drink for 20 hours prior to donating blood.

I sat with the patient in the consultation room for 20 minutes, until he became more calm. I offered him some water and I took his blood pressure every 5 minutes.  It was initially 154/105 and eventually decreased to 140/90. His heart rate was normal and he had no shortness of breath or signs of any rash. He threw up twice.  I offered to call ems for him if he wanted  but he declined. Once his blood pressure decreased he said that he felt better and sat in the pharmacy waiting area until he felt completely better. I called him 30 minutes after his departure from the pharmacy to make sure he got home safe and he was thankful for the call. I did advise him to contact his PCP if the numbness in his hand worsens or does not get better. I also told him to seek medical help if he gets any shortness of breath, rash or other unusual symptoms.

I advised to go to ER for evaluation. I followed up on Tues 6/8/21 and he stated the ER said he has inflammation of the heart and lungs but sent him home. Also none of the previous symptoms had resolved and he also has pain in left upper chest, decreased energy and loss of appetite. The patient said he doesn&#39;t have a PCP so I advised to go to ER again.

                                                After receiving the vaccine the patient was instructed to sit at the designated post vaccination area. As he was sitting in the chair, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine the patient lost consciousness and fell from the chair onto the floor. The patient was unresponsive for a few seconds. When I positioned him in an upward position he regained consciousness and did not remember what happened. The patient had a fast heart rate and was feeling hot, dizzy, and nauseated. He showed no signs of anaphylactic/allergic reaction. Patient admitted he was nervous and anxious about the vaccine and does not like needles. I instructed the patient to remain seated on the floor and gave him an ice pack, water, and told him to take deep breathes. Patient stated he felt better. The store manager and I called 911 to get paramedics to check his vitals. Patient denied to go to emergency room, said he was feeling better. Patient confirmed he lived only a few blocks away and he had someone to drive him. Paramedics cleared the patient and stated all vitals were in normal range. Patient stayed at the pharmacy for 10 more minutes after that with instructions if he felt any symptoms to call his doctor or 911.

                                                Fatigue; light-headed; nausea; physical weakness; headache; body ache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 32-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 07May2021 07:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0185) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy to peanuts and shellfish allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19, since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. After the administration of first dose, the patient experienced fatigue lasting from 2 days after dose through receiving 2nd dose, light-headed, nausea, physical weakness, headache and body ache. Following questions of what were caused can&#39;t be answered. The patient received full-time care while bedridden first day and a half from his partner and continue to receive care daily as he was not able to accomplish much on his own at this point. He does not know if this was a permanent condition caused by the vaccine nor does he know what the extent of any permanent damage was. This was the worst his body has ever felt. The outcome of the events was not recovered.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot numbers and expiry dates were unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Dec2020 for the first dose and on 08Jan2021 for the second dose, both administered in the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2 and did not receive any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 09Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea, shortness of breath, tiredness, and stiffness at the injection site. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovered. The report was considered as non-serious; the events did not result in death, were not life threatening, did not caused/prolonged hospitalization, were not disabling/ incapacitating, and did not caused any congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

A 33-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose on right arm, mid bicep for COVID-19 immunization. There were no patient history. Concomitant medications included hepatitis b vaccine on 14Dec2020, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), calcium and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number:EK5730) on 18Dec2020 (left arm) and he experienced little pain around the injection site, some nausea and some bouts of dizziness. The patient received the Covid 19 Vaccine 4 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination, so he identified this as an error in administration. So the Hepatitis B vaccination was given on 14Dec2020 and the first Covid 19 Vaccine was given on 18Dec2020. He received the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that originally the prescriber who administered it the first two doses had scheduled him to receive the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine as the same day as his second Hepatitis B Vaccination and he identified this error last Wednesday and stated &#34;I believe or potentially today, I&#39;m not sure which one I&#39;m sorry I had to check with that&#34;. So, he was trying to get this all cleared up. He did report symptoms for both Covid Vaccines as little pain around the injection site, some nausea, some bouts of dizziness. So, patient had already discussed the common adverse reactions with him. Patient was told that co-administration has not been studied yet and referred him to his HCP for continued guidance on how and when to space out the additional Hepatitis B vaccination that he will need. Patient was &#34;32&#34; back in December when this happened. He had his birthday and turned 33. Second shot for the Covid was scheduled the same day the Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) but due to inveigle in-charge of the vaccine, he had lost his paper work and he had been on vacation and stated &#34;had been vaccine was not found they just gave me the second Covid Vaccine and told me to come back by Thursday and I should have found it and have everything cleared up by then but then Wednesday they called me and told me that they have realized that they are not supposed to give vaccine co-administered with 14 days window before or after. I haven&#39;t got my second Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) just the first one was administered within the 4 days period of the first shot&#34;. Patient work at Dietary Providence. The patient had his blood drawn this morning (20Jan2021). Patient does not have product details for hepatitis B vaccine. Patient stated that the nurse on duty had said that the vaccine they had stocks was &#34;Engerix-B hepatitis B recombinant&#34; but that was not verified as far as definitively is just what she had stocked when he was going on his incident report. Patient further stated, &#34;As far as all things are concerned you know I went to a doctor got checked he said breathing was great, heart rate was great, oxygen level 98 percent, he has drawn blood by then is there anything that I should be doing at this point cataloging thing any other test any other people to contact. What should I do going forward specially what can I do to be helpful for you guys to get this situation clear.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 33-year-old male Other HCP reported that he receive second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number EL8982), intramuscular at single dose into the left arm on 18Jan2021 at 10:45 am for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had received the first dose of vaccine (Lot number ElC9231) on 28Dec2020 at 11:30 am intramuscular into the left arm. Medical history was none. Concomitant drugs were none. On 20Jan2021 the patient experienced fever followed by unremitting abdominal pain that led to hospital admission for pain management and diagnostic imaging that revealed swelling of spleen and liver. Proton pump inhibitor via IV. Opioid IV in ER. the patient was hospitalized for 3 days. Unremarkable patient history prior to this even for GI and cardio. Non smoker non alcohol user. First ever hospitalization as an adult. On 21Jan2021 the patient had a negative Nasal Swab test for covid. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and in absence of strong confounding factors, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events fever, abdominal pain and swelling of spleen and liver.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Starting Monday February 22 (six days after second dose), I experienced moderate muscle cramping and soreness in the back of the neck, lower back, and buttocks/legs.

This has persisted until today (Thursday, February 25).

                                                About two hours after getting the vaccine I started having flu like symptoms. The arm where I got the shot started aching, it felt a lot like tennis elbow. I got waves of intense nausea. My nose began running. I developed a sore throat.  I got waves of light headedness, occasionally feeling like I may pass out. And I was extremely thirsty. No matter how much water I drank, my mouth was dry and I felt severely dehydrated. This lasted for about three and a half hours and then passed and I felt normal again.

                                                I received my first dose of the pfizer vaccine at 11am at the safeway pharmacy. I had consumed several glasses of water in the morning before the event, a cup of yerba mate tea, and a piece of toast. I smoke, and had smoked one cigarette in the morning before my appointment. Just after receiving the vaccine I ate a few pieces of jerky and maybe 15 Jojo potatoes from the safeway deli.  I was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. I set an alarm. I bought some food to eat (jojo potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22am. I felt strange/weird, but this isn&#39;t an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for me.   I was driving to work and I started to feel just a little bit strange after smoking another cigarette. I got a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later I started to get dizzy, my ears rang, I felt my blood pressure drop, and I passed out on the interstate going freeway speeds. I woke up around a minute and half later according to my brother who was on the phone. I was treated for injuries at emergency room.

                                                I have some mild tinnitus which I&#39;ve had for 15 years since high school and rarely bothers me. Go months without noticing it.   A few hours after my first dose of Pfizer (left arm), I got a headache and some queasiness. The expected side effects. My ears started ringing louder and more pronounced, which I assumed was a side-effect of the headache and/or immune response to the vaccine. It&#39;s past two weeks now since dose 1 and my ears are still ringing much more loudly and noticeably than in the last 15 or so years. All other side effects have long ago subsided. It seems to be worse in left ear, the same side I got shot on. I imagine that&#39;s irrelevant, but mentioning it anyway here.   Distracting and distressing.  Am scheduled for a second dose on April 21 and now hesitant about getting it.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

As I am driving out of the parking lot, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/nauseous, and my vision becomes extremely blurry, even to the point of near blindness. I stopped the car and sat for about 30 seconds/1 minute until my vision returned sufficiently to drive back to the waiting area where I requested water. I immediately felt better with the water, and the staff also gave me benadryl although I don&#39;t think it had any impact. I felt weak for an additional 30 minutes or so and spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. I felt fine to drive after this 30 minutes and have had no side effects since.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of even to the point of near blindness, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/felt weak, nauseous and my vision becomes extremely blurry. No treatment was reported for the event spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. Outcome of the events was recovered on 31Mar2021.

Breathing was a little more difficult due to these pains. The symptoms have persisted since that time, although they have been more subdued. Experienced a peak again around noon on 4/30/2021, but is milder again as I submit this.

The clinical course was as follows: the patient was advised to wait 15 minutes before leaving. He set an alarm. He bought some food to eat (potatoes and jerky) and waited to leave the site until 11:22. He felt strange/weird, but this was not an unusual feeling after receiving any kind of shot/vaccine for the patient. He was driving to work and started to get a little nauseous but nothing too bad. Thirty seconds later, he started to get dizzy, ears rang, felt blood pressure drop, and passed out going freeway speeds. He was treated in the emergency department and released the same day. There was no treatment given in response to the events. There was no covid prior to or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was recovering.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose? What about Tylenol or Ibuprofen?&#34;  I had a side effect after the first dose of the vaccine.  Should I get the second dose?  e-transmitting potential duplicate AE. Caller said he didn&#39;t give PCP information to the safety agent. He did not have. Response: Spoke from EUA PI (Revised: 06 April 2021) under Post Authorization Experience Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers (Revised: 06 April 2021) under section WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE? As noted in the Fact Sheet for Recipients, you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision.

Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose? What about Tylenol or Ibuprofen?&#34;  Caller wanted to know if his reactions could be due to him having covid before and if it was safe to get the covid vaccine after having covid infection.

                                                I had no side effects immediately after receiving either my first or second Pfizer shot. However, in both cases, a little over three weeks after I received the shot, I experienced a one day illness that started with nausea in the morning with no vomiting, followed by roughly 3/4 of the rest of the day experiencing extreme fatigue, some coughing and inability to take a full breath without coughing in the morning (this cleared by the afternoon). A lack of appetite was also observed.  I don?t know if this is a side effect, or just an evenly spaced illness coincidence. However, the fact that two identical illnesses that essentially cleared in a day and mirrored some COVID symptoms affected me after receiving the vaccines makes me wonder. I?ve never had an illness like this that comes on so strong, but then clears so quickly.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

He said that he felt a little dizzy and hot and started to feel nauseous. The pharmacist gave him a cold compress and had him lie on the ground and elevate his feet. After about 10 minutes the patient said he felt fine so we helped him back in his chair and asked that he stay longer for us to monitor him. He waiting an additional 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left.

                                                about 29 hours after the vaccine, I began to develop a cough/sore throat.  In addition to that, my stomach began to experience pain and feel constipated (started to develop this feeling 42 hours after vaccine).  Have had slight nausea as well. Have tried taking a couple Tylenol which seemed to help.  Currently only symptoms that are persisting are the discomfort in the stomach.

                                                First dose of vaccine received on April 6. Soreness in arm for remainder of day, slight fever to 100.5 that night. No symptoms for remainder of week. Slight cough began in the morning on April 12, no other symptoms at that point. Woke up on April 13 with 101.4 F temperature, and throat soreness that made swallowing incredibly painful. Sore throat has made continuous sleep nearly impossible for the next two days (so far), as whenever I swallow I wake myself up, which happens every 10-15 minutes. This has resulted in general fatigue throughout the day. Fever, sore throat, coughing all get worse at night time. Average temperature during the day has been 99.5 F, while temperature readings after 10 PM have been in the 101-102 F range. Appears to be semi-breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e. after first dose of vaccine, but before second dose), based on timing of symptoms and subsequent positive PCR test.

                                                I had a nasty zit on the back of my neck, popped it, and my immune response was extreme. Initial: Itching and burning through my neck and shoulders, and swollen lymph nodes in neck and collarbone. I began sweating at night profusely and losing weight. I have had a lot of trouble sleeping. These symptoms continued in 24-48 hour cycles of flare ups until 04/19/2021 but finally seem to be abating. Progression: secondary symptoms appeared over the course of the month such as full body joint soreness, weakness, stiffness, stabbing pains (in the neck, arms, chest, and abdomen), blood pressure spikes, dry/sore throat, dry eyes, difficulty swallowing. Symptoms are similar to arthritis or other autoimmune diseases. Night sweats continue but are lighter. Weight loss continues but slower. Sleeping remains irregular.

I have had two other &#34;events&#34; that I assumed were gallbladder attacks but the pain subsided within a few hours. With this event, after a few hours and the pain was still high, I had to be driven to the ER. Just before leaving my house I started getting tunnel vision and my arms and legs went numb. I was able to walk on my own again once reaching the hospital. As of today, 5 days later, I am still in pain. I have taken out all fatty foods and things that are bad for gallbladder issues and still no change.

I was very stressed about it and it had been six days since the shot, so I just assumed I was either having a heart attack or a really bad panic attack. I did a meditation and chewed a couple aspirin just in case.  There was extreme tightness in my chest. Breathing was difficult. The dizziness, nausea, and inability to control my body temperature went away within a couple hours and I managed to sleep. But the chest tightness and difficulty breathing persisted for about 3 or 4 days.  I also noticed it hurt more whenever I was sitting upright or forward, and it hurt almost zero when I leaned back or laid down.

                                                16 hours after my second shot, I woke up with some nausea.  I went to the bathroom, did not vomit, however in the middle of urinating I collapsed on the floor, couldn&#39;t walk, couldn&#39;t form full sentences, started sweating profusely, had to crawl back to my bed, and my pulse was through the roof.  I almost went to the ER, but the episode subsided within 15 minutes.   When I tried to fall back asleep, it felt like I was blacking out and not drifting asleep.  The next day, I experienced the typical flu like symptoms.  Followed by 4 days of normalcy.  On the 4th day, while working, I experienced a sharp 3 second &#34;electric shock&#34; feeling in my left side of my chest.   On the 5th day, I already had previously scheduled an appointment with my primary for a physical.  I told her about my episode; she took an EKG which yielded normal results.  Lab work also looked ok.  On the 6th day, I started feeling some more nausea and fatigue.  On the 7th day, the vertigo intensified tenfold, and the room was spinning.  That&#39;s when I started experiencing the following symptoms:  ? More nausea. ? Dizzy spells that come and go, especially after eating. ? Persistent periodic electric shock feeling in my left chest.  It?s dull but annoying.  And just when I think it?s gone for good, another 1 second shock happens. ? Left arm is  weak - the entire arm. ? When I try to sleep, the left side of my head feels as though I?m blacking out when I start drifting.  It almost feels like I?m getting anesthesia or something like that.  But just the left side. ? Basically the left side of my body (I got the jab in my left arm) from the waist up just feels off. ? One of my arms is numb when I wake up until I shake it out.  It?s not one particular arm. ? Energy levels are low.  Especially when I wake up and start moving around.  On the 8th day, I went to the ER thinking  perhaps it was a heart attack.  Nothing - EKG was again normal and lab work was normal.  The doctor told me it&#39;s all in my head - anxiety.  However, I&#39;m not anxious and I&#39;m a very level headed individual.    It&#39;s now day 12 and I feel overall awful.  I can&#39;t concentrate on anything.  I&#39;m not thinking clearly and forgetting simple things.  The dull feeling and electric shocks on my left side continue.  I&#39;ve never felt this bad before.  I&#39;m a healthy 34 year old that exercises regularly, has never smoked or done drugs, rarely drinks alcohol, and eats generally very healthy.  If given a second chance I would not take the covid shot.  I am praying this goes away.

A 34-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EN6202), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 09Mar2021 at 12:45 (at the age of 34-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 Immunisation. The patient medical history included gout, chronic depression, HF (high functioning) anxiety and BPD 2 (borderline personality disorder). The patient concomitant medications included colchicine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19.

                                                After receiving my second COVID-19 vaccine, I began feeling feverish and achy about 20 hours after the shot. I left work early to come home and rest. About 34 hours after the shot, I woke up around 2:00 am with intense abdominal and back pain, a fever, and vomiting. I took Tylenol and tried to rest, but my discomfort continued throughout the day. By the afternoon of March 30, I began to worry that I was having more than a typical vaccine reaction. The PA who saw me assessed my symptoms, performed an abdominal exam, and then dismissed my issues as a bad vaccine reaction. He gave me an injection of toradol and sent me home. My symptoms subsided after the toradol injection, but I still felt unwell.   On March 31, I had a previously scheduled visit with my primary care doctor. During the visit, I described my symptoms after receiving the vaccine, but I was told again that I was just having a really bad reaction to the vaccine. Throughout that day, my condition continued to worsen, and by the evening of the 31st I developed a fever and my abdominal pain returned. I scheduled an emergency telemedicine visit. I described my symptoms and described the pain I was feeling, but again, I was told I was having a bad vaccine reaction.   On the morning of April 1, I woke up with a fever and debilitating abdominal pain. I drove myself to the ER where I was diagnosed appendicitis. My appendix was about to rupture, so I was rushed into surgery. I was released after several days but had to return.

So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen. Same symptoms on Saturday with increase in intensity, plus mild fever in the evening at 99.6 F (instead of 97.4 F which is &#34;my normal&#34;), nausea, painful eye balls, sensitivity to light and noise, loss of appetite. Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

A 35-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL0140, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12Jan2021, 9:00AM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergies to Amoxicillin, Quinolones, and Sulfa drugs, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D) and cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12); patient received these medications with two weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 12Jan2021, 19:00, just after evening, patient&#39;s throat started feeling itchy and had pins and needles feeling. Gradually the symptoms increased in intensity and in the night of 12Jan2021 (time unspecified), he felt like his throat was swollen. It was also reported that patient woke up today, 13Jan2021 with the same feeling and there is pain on swallowing in the throat. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events was reported as recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on a chronological association, causality between events odynophagia, pharyngeal swelling and throat irritation and BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE)  cannot be completely excluded.

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

A 35-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 21Jan2021 12:00 (at 35 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: EL9263) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing food allergy. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  After receiving the Covid Vaccine on 21Jan2021, the caller has experienced a lot of adverse side effects that he&#39;s dealing with now almost 3 and a half months later. He has seen numerous doctors as well as specialists. He has a long list of symptoms that occurred at onset. What he is dealing with now is a swollen neck (onset date 21Jan2021), a sore throat (onset date 21Jan2021), tongue discoloration, and just general fatigue (onset date 21Jan2021) and malaise (onset date 21Jan2021). Prior to the shot he was physically healthy. He was running about 20 miles a week. Then he got the shot and his health declined significantly and he is still recovering. When this occurred, caller weighed 165 pounds, and now he weighs 145 pounds. He lost 20 pounds. These events happened after the first dose of the vaccine. He got his vaccine at around noon on 21Jan2021, and by that evening at around 2000 he had a tightness in his throat, felt like his right ear was plugged up, then had pain on the right side of his neck. It all coincided with the same side as the vaccine, which he had in his right arm. He also experienced some pretty severe chills. His throat still feels swollen, probably because of his swollen lymph nodes. Some days it is better and some days it is worse. It is causing constant pressure on his neck. He is not sure if he noticed the swollen lymph nodes the same day as the shot or shortly after.Patient does not currently have neck pain. He should probably mention it started probably a few weeks after the onset of his symptoms. He does not know when it went away. He was getting swollen lymph nodes on his left side as well, and his throat became sore on the left side as well. It went away maybe a few weeks ago. He is not sure when the swollen lymph nodes or the sore throat started. His right ear was plugged and then it affected his left ear and it got plugged up as well. It was to the point where he could barely hear. It was almost like an ear infection when it is completely plugged and there is pressure behind the ear drum. 2 weeks after his right side it started on the left side. It has subsided by this time, but it has not completely gone away, but it is not as bad. Patietnt had the chills for 3 weeks, but they weren&#39;t as severe as the first night. He was just freezing cold and could not get warm. After that night he was still having issues feeling warm and had to keep his bedroom at like 80 degrees constantly. It probably continued for about a month. He doesn&#39;t have chills now, however it evolved into more of a heat intolerance. Whenever he feels to warm he feels more tired and not well overall. It is really odd. It is more heat intolerance he feels is going on. After the first few months it started then he had the opposite. He had a problem getting warm, then after the first month he didn&#39;t tolerate heat too well. He is not sure when the tongue discoloration first started, but he noticed it about a month and a half ago. The general fatigue and malaise started at the beginning with everything else. He did not have the second dose of the vaccine. Caller believes the doctors ran a CBC. He had a complete panel done a few times and nothing concerning presented or stood out to the doctors. They did an ultrasound on the left side of his abdomen to make sure he had no spleen enlargement, and that came back normal. They ran thyroid panels and those came back normal. One thing that came back abnormal that explains more of this but the timing is odd with the vaccine is he came back positive for Mono. He started seeing an ENT specialist, and he believes that getting the vaccine could have caused his immune system to freak out considering his history with allergies. It could have caused the Epstein Mono virus already present to become reactivated. That was kind of his theory on why this could have occurred. All the events caused a visit to Emergency Room. He went to the ER about a week, exactly a week after he had the vaccine that day. He was having trouble swallowing (onset date 28Jan2021) as well as his breathing was becoming a concern (onset date 28Jan2021) for him. He also was just having what felt like anxiety-like symptoms (onset date 28Jan2021), and he has no history of anxiety. If he got the vaccine on 21Jan2021 then this happened around 28Jan2021. He did have another ER visit about a week after that one as well. He started to have severe symptoms similar to the first time he went. He is still having a little bit of an issue swallowing. He attributes that to the swelling in his lymph nodes and neck possibly affecting that. His breathing he does not have problems with so much now. He has more of a constant discomfort in his neck, though it is not affecting his breathing at this point. As far as general anxiety he still has that and it does cause issues. It is causing him to not sleep as a result. His swallowing is better. His breathing was the most severe of the symptoms. Maybe after the first month it began to become less of an issue. He couldn&#39;t say exactly when it went away. It probably went away as a result of the swelling subsiding. To be honest he is not sure. Doctors put the caller on numerous medications as well as a medicine that he continued with. He doesn&#39;t know if his anxiety is better as a result of the medicine helping or if it would be the same if he went off of it. He is not sure. He has had trouble sleeping since this all began. It has been a little better. It could be a result of the medicine that helped. He is really unsure if he was not on the medicine how it would be. Patient visited a Physician Office for all events.No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. The outcome of the events Throat tightness,Sensation of block in ear,Swallowing difficult,Anxiety, Sleep difficult,Hearing reduced was recovering; chills,Swollen lymph nodes,Neck pain,Sore throat was recovered; Tongue discoloration, heat intolerance,Fatigue,Malaise was not recovered; other events was unknown.

He sat down for bit and symptoms persisted.  He vomited x1 and went home, assuming he had developed the same &#34;24 GI bug&#34; his daughter had over the weekend. Once home he continued to feel unwell.  He called his mother who proceeded to call EMS.  EKG revealed anterior and inferior STE and he was taken directly to cardio lab for emergent coronary angiography, where he was found to have total thrombotic occlusion of midLAD, treated with drug-eluting stents.

A 35-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8734), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 26May2021 at 04:10 as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol from Dec2020, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from Dec2020 (not related to lifestyle or diet), and ongoing heartburn from Nov2020 (received omeprazole for couple of months, two weeks before vaccination for heartburn or acid reflux, for his ulcer, for GI), H-pylori (patient got two courses of antibiotics for 10 days and diagnosed with H-pylori in January), patient thought maybe the antibiotics harmed his body and allergy to grass (undiagnosed allergy to grass and it was more severe in spring in early summer). No prior vaccinations and no family history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took omeprazole on Jan2021 for heartburn (one pill one day during two-week period before vaccine administration. He took for two month and later had a break from it. He was not taking it lately). On 26May2021, the patient experienced chest and lung pain from the vaccine among additional side effects, severe chest pain on the left side, moderate lung pain on both sides, throat sickness, hard to swallow, hands were really cold, face numbness. swollen inside the throat and burning in lung on both sides, itching in lung on both sides, more like a choking, allergic reaction, more like a pressure in the chest. The patient experienced moderate lung pain on both sides. This was 40 minutes after vaccination. It was moderate. He felt a burning and itching in lungs on both sides. The patient experienced severe chest pain on the left side. Severe chest pain was 15 minutes after lung pain began. It was on the left side, mostly to the ribs, where heart is located. Pain was moderate to maybe severe. Sometimes it was a little bit hard to breathe. It was more like he was afraid to breathe because of the pain. Confirmed there was not issue with his airway. More like a pressure in the chest. As the lung pain was going away then chest pain came in. Dime size pressure. He stated he got sickness in his throat a little bit after. It was hard to swallow. He was not worried about it. He stated he was able to breath and was able to drink water. It was more like a choking. It happened after he left the vaccination site. It was maybe like 20 minutes after he had the vaccination. His hands were really cold as well after. The patient severe chest pain was improved a little bit. The chest pain on left side lasted 25-30 minutes. After that it was kind of resolved. In a couple hours it came back. The reporter stated right now it was coming back, but more lighter. It was not a severe pain (mild to moderate). It was sort of like a sore muscle in the chest. The patient had sickness in throat, when trying to swallow. The face numbness felt right after chest pain. He also felt this one hour ago, maybe on left side. He felt it for a few minutes, but not sure if it was connected. The patient also got two courses of antibiotics for 10 days. His doctor diagnosed with him with H-pylori in January. He thinks maybe the antibiotics harmed his body. He read articles about heart inflammation that lead to myocarditis or something like that. The patient thought that what he was experiencing is maybe an allergic reaction. He read articles about heart inflammation that lead to myocarditis or something like that, kids and young adults experienced chest pain after getting the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. He then explained he also read about 68 cases, among which there were 20 individuals and 2 individuals who died: a 22-year-old female and 35-year-old male. Patient thinks maybe he was experiencing an allergic reaction. No Investigation Assessment. No relevant tests. Outcome of the event Lung pain and hands were really cold was recovered on 26May2021, for chest pain, throat sickness, hard to swallow, more like a choking, hands were really cold, face numbness and more like a pressure in the chest was not recovering while unknown for rest of the events.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.  I have no prior history of similar symptoms after receiving vaccines or medications in the past.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                Mild headache approx 4 hours after injection.  When waking to alarm at 0600 on 25Mar21, noticed that bed was wet from sweating.  Foread was hot to the touch, ague, severe headache, light and noise sensitivity.  The room was cold, I turned up the heat in the house and put on sweatpants, socks, thermal shirt, hoodie, and beanie and could not get warm.  Began drinking water (1.5 gal by end of day at 2300).   No appetite for the entire day, nausea set on after eating a bowl of oatmeal around 1030.  Had several episodes of dry heaving, but no vomiting after eating.  Ate again at around 1900 - chicken broth and a peanut butter sandwich, nausea set on at around 1945, dry heaving, but no vomiting.  Spoke with PCM on symptoms and continued to monitor.  On 26 Mar21, cold sensation had abated, continued drinking water.  Headache, light sensitivity, nausea, and body aches for the entire day, headache has remaind constant - 6 out of 10.  Nausea at a 4.  Body Aches varied between 4-7.  Around 1100, I noticed that my neck had stiffened and it felt as if I had a tension headache.  I used a theracane, heat, and an ice pack to try and relieve the tension with no success.  I have tried relaxation techniques learned from VA to manage pain with no success.  As of 2146, stiffness is around a 6, headache is a 7, body aches 3, nausea while sitting 1, while walking 4.

The next day it felt slightly better but overnight to Saturday morning it came back horribly and radiated to lower right side to where I could not even sleep on my side. I went to the ER, they did a cat scan and immed told to have emergency surgery to get appedix out. While in surgery they ended up having to do a hemi colectomy due to how bad the appendicitis was.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

                                                This patient was vaccinated with the  vaccine at approx 1530, in the left arm. He was sitting in the observation area for his allotted 15 minutes. At approx 1540 this nurse was called over by a staff member and was told that this patient was feeling dizzy, hot and nauseous. This patient presented as diaphoretic and pale.  RN&#39;s, came over to the patient and began asking basic demographic info questions, and started to measure his vital signs. This patient denied any heart issues or past medical history. His father was present and was seated next to the patient. We had the patient move onto a cot and we had the patient lay down and we elevated his feet. The patients initial vital signs were: 110/70, HR 56 and O2 99% at 1543. He stated that he felt some shortness of breath but was able to speak to us without difficulty. No wheezing or rhonchi present. We kept the patients legs elevated and provided a cold pack to his head and neck. After approx 10 minutes the patient stated he felt better, but he felt cold and his legs and upper body were shaking. Once we sat him up into a sitting position he stated he wasn&#39;t feeling dizzy. We kept him there for another 10 minutes until he felt better. His vital signs were measured again and his bp was 140/90, HR 91 and O2 level was 99%. The patient denied any difficulty breathing. This nurse advised for the patient and his father to go to the Emergency Room if another episode of this occurs. The patient understood and he walked with his father to their car without any difficulty.

                                                I felt like my stomach was going to explode the day after getting the vaccine.  The amount of pressure in my belly, it felt like something was going to burst.  I was able to throw up 5x, which relieved some pressure, but I was still very uncomfortable.  Yesterday and Today (Day 3 &amp; 4 post vaccination shot), I have been monitoring the pain in my stomach, and the pain has traveled to the lower-right portion of my stomach.  I am afraid my appendix is going to burst.  I?m going to see a Dr today.  I believe this is very unfair to me, an essential employee, who never contracted Covid-19 while still attending work over the last year, I was encouraged to take the vaccination shot by the state and my employer, and now I?m afraid I will need surgery.  Please look in to this.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship. However, the reported events may possibly represent intercurrent medical conditions in this patient.  There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics including MRI of abdomen and vascular angiogram, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications. This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021.

Slept on the other side and went ok. Next night same pain around 5am, this time I couldn?t sleep after.  Then 3/4 days after the shot, pain in my groins and intestines. It feels really irritated and pain varies from 1 to 4.5 on a scale of 10 throughout the days. It?s been now 10 days since the shot and this pain is not getting away or improving. Sometimes I also experience pain in the left side of my  stomach as well but it?s much less frequent than groins and intestines.

I would go from normal temperature of around 98 to 101 or so and back within a matter of 20 minutes.  Additionally, random parts of my body would get very hot at times.  About 2 hours after the side effects started, I became nauseous and threw up.  I was unable to eat for nearly 24 hours.  It seems that the fever and most side effects subsided through the 2nd night after vaccination.

The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care.

Immediately went to ER to check. Was treated for palpitation and dehydration. Felt normal after couple of days.  I took second dose on 05/06/2021. I felt normal for about a week. After that i started feeling heavy or pressure in my head and also dizziness. For past one week I&#39;m feeling acid reflux and heartburn. Considering i had history of acid reflux I never had this issue for past few years. I&#39;m not sure if my GERD issues are induced by vaccine. I&#39;m having controlled diet with fruits and veggies but i still have  heartburn and frequent burps. Also my Blood Pressure is still elevated around 130-140 and feeling tired and pressure in my head even now after  18 days of taking 2nd dose. I had consulted my physician on 05/20/2021, and she prescribed a medicine to take only when my blood pressure is above 140.   Just to summarize, I still have dizziness and occasionally elevated BP and acid reflux, heartburn/burps. This is impacting my day to day home and office works

                                                Patient received the shot at approximately 2:00pm. He was visibly anxious while waiting for the shot and receiving it, as he verbalized he was afraid of needles. After giving the shot and sitting for about 5 minutes, he stated he was feeling a little bit light headed and nauseous. At this time, I pulled up next to him and talked about symptoms. There was slight nausea and felt a little &#34;out of sorts.&#34; Due to the nausea, gave a dose of benadryl in order to help with the nausea, sweats, and nervousness. 9-1-1 was called during benadryl administration. Within 5 minutes, the patient began to talk about his throat being itchy, and when about to administer epinephrine the paramedics arrived and took over, and left in an ambulance. Ultimately after discharge from the hospital, the patient did not receive Epinephrine either from our clinic or from the hospital.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

On 20Jan2021, about an hour or two after the vaccination, the patient had begun feeling quite unwell; had strong flu symptoms; was feeling very hot/cold; had intense aching; muscle soreness all over; inflamed lymph nodes (especially in the neck); some nausea; and internal temperature (taken under the tongue) was very low at about 95 degrees. The patient had received treatment for the reported events; blood pressure was taken; and he was given water. The adverse events had required doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events, &#39;lightheaded/dizziness&#39;, &#39;feeling warm&#39;, &#39;uncomfortable tingling sensations that started in the fingers and moved up to the arms&#39;, &#39;feeling quite unwell&#39;, &#39;strong flu symptoms&#39;, &#39;feeling very hot/cold&#39;, &#39;intense aching&#39;, &#39;muscle soreness all over&#39;, &#39;inflamed lymph nodes (especially in the neck)&#39;, &#39;nausea&#39; and &#39;internal temperature (taken under the tongue) was very low at about 95 degrees&#39;, was recovering. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested since the vaccination.

                                                Only symptom experienced during first ~36 hours after receiving vaccine was soreness near injection area of left arm.   A couple hours after falling as sleep the second night after vaccination shot (Sunday night), I woke up very cold / severe shivering. After several hours I managed to fall asleep for approximately another 1-2 hours. The next day I experienced fever, shivers, general body weakness/fatigue, and muscle aches/discomfort especially in both legs. These symptoms lasted throughout the day.  That night (Monday night), when I got into bed, I was strongly shivering. I managed to fall asleep for 1-2 hours, but woke up uncomfortably warm. I was unable to fall back asleep until 4-5 hours later. I woke up 1-2 hours later, with most of my body dripping with sweat, and the sheets rather damp.  Tuesday and Wednesday: Symptoms came and went, mostly feelings of fever, chills, general fatigue, lost appetite, and mild light headedness. Sleeping remained difficult, able to stay asleep for &lt;4 hours each night.    As of today (Thursday), fever has subsided. Still generally feel fatigued, occasionally lightheaded.

I followed up with him in 2 hours after he left and he said that he felt much better. I told him to seek medical attention if he had further symptoms that were unresolved.

                                                Worst sickness/flu like symptoms I have ever experienced. Bad dehydration, diarrhea, throwing up, fatigue, light headed, chills, fainting/passing out. Had to diarrhea over 30 times in one day, throw up several times. Went to emergency room for treatment. IV treatment plus anti naseau and anti cramping   Medication. Cramping was severe in upper intestine. Symptoms have decreased, but still linger after 2 weeks of 2nd shot.  Concern if side effects are permeant. I still very tired/fatigued,  have cramping, dirahaha, throwing up, aches muscles and joints- not feeling like myself and regret taking the vaccine if it results in lifelong side effects.

Monday night ~10:00 p.m.: random, mild pain in chest; feels like a needle is poking into my heart. More wiped out than usual, go to bed 1-2 hours earlier than normal. Monday night-Tuesday morning, ~12 hours after shot: ~1:40 a.m. Wake up with chills &amp; apparent fever; didn&#39;t have thermometer ~2:02 a.m. Nausea quickly turns to vomiting. Headache begins. ~3:30 a.m. 2nd round of vomiting. Dry heaves. Muscle contractions are longer &amp; more severe than typical for me. ***Unable to sleep much. Fever apparently breaks. Headache, overall fatigue.*** ~7:30 a.m. 3rd round of vomiting. Dry heaves. Muscle contractions are longer &amp; more severe than typical for me. ~10:00-10:30 a.m. Drive to pharmacy; buy thermometer and aspirin. Thermometer reads 97.4º, then 96.7º, so the fever is long gone. ~11:00-12:30 p.m. Take one tablet (81 mg) of aspirin every 30 minutes with a couple of ounces of water. That&#39;s all the water I can drink. ~12:40 p.m. 4th round of vomiting; lost the water. Muscle contractions wouldn&#39;t stop; I felt dizzy at the end. ~2:10 p.m. Wake up feeling slightly better; last 30 minutes on the computer for work. Go back to sleep. ~4:15 p.m. Wake up feeling much better; last ~1 hour on the computer. ~10:00 p.m. start eating again. First time in 24 hours.

                                                Recipient had a prior history of the feeling of a lump in his throat, narrowing of his throat and dry throat with his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This resolved with oral Benadryl at home.  Prior medical history included COVID disease in January, 2021. Due to his history, he was vaccinated next to our ambulance with physician and EMS team in attendance. Approximately 5 minutes after vaccination, recipient began complaining of dryness of the throat and feeling a lump in his throat without any compromise in breathing. Approximately 9 minutes post vaccination, he complained of a progression of his swallowing symptoms, swelling and pressure feeling (periorbital and in the malar area) of the face. He did not complain of dyspnea. Due to his symptoms, he was administered 0.3 mL of epinephrine IM at 10:39, followed by diphenhydramine 50 mg IM approximately 1-2 minutes later. Symptoms seemed to remain static, with treatment, with the exception of post-epinephrine shakiness and complaints of tingling of his feet. Initial vital signs were: Pulse 90, Respirations 20, BP 148/84 and SaO2 of 99. Vital signs and SaO2 remained stable.  A transport ambulance was notified and recipient was transferred to the care of EMS for further treatment and observation.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

                                                Timeline just provided to neurologist.   5/1 - 2nd COVID vaccine (Pfizer) 5/3 - Went to Urgent Care for primarily chest pains 5/5 - GP sent to ER after continued severe chest pains and getting very winded after only a few steps. Weekend of 5/8 - vomiting, likely fever (felt like true vaccine side effects) - no vomiting/fever since  Since then, lots of tests/dr visits.  Current symptoms: tingliness/numbness - left leg - midshin to foot/toes. Left arm - elbow to hand/fingers. Face started to tingle ~2 weeks post vaccine - left side. Extremely fatigued. Some brain fog/forgetfullness. Lack of motivation. Irritability some days. Headaches - some days really bad, other days none. Chest pains come/go throughout day. Was getting winded walking up 3 stairs but that has been slightly better. Some days - extensive muscle pain. Especially in lower back &amp; left hip area. Some days - whole body aches. Chills - feels like body temp is off. Things come in waves - numbness/tingliness is pretty much all the time though. Also, insomnia. Did start to take 1.25mg of melatonin as needed but still very fatigued.  5/19 - Stared acupuncture (plan is 2x a week) Around 5/21 - developed rash. Face (R&amp;L side), neck/jaw area (L), inner thigh (L). Doesn&#39;t itch all the time but when it does, it really itches. Has continued 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - headaches worsened 5/22 &amp; 5/23 - developed diarrhea 5/23 - more tingliness developed midshin to right foot and more in right arm.  5/25 - joints began to hurt more - especially in elbow area  Lung dr. Rx&#39;ed albuterol (?) on Friday, 5/21 just in case something was going on in lungs. Has not helped.   The lung dr. noted weakness in right leg during physical exam.   Lung dr. and cardiologist discussed possibility of Guillain Barre Syndrome. Another blood test was ordered to check for some receptors. Awaiting results.  Neurologist appt scheduled for 5/ 28

At the same time my right arm (opposite the injection arm) began to have muscle spasms which too passed. A wave of cold spread throughout my body and immediately my anxiety began to skyrocket (untriggered). None of these symptoms occurred after 1st dose.  Insomnia the night of both the 1st and 2nd doses.   Nearly 2.5 weeks after 2nd dose, dizziness is a daily occurrence followed by symptoms of vertigo (at times wakes me up at night). Fatigue has intensified.

A 37-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 01May2021 14:30 (Lot Number: EW0176) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included multiple sclerosis and known allergies: All mammalian meats (alpha gal protein), shellfish, and tree nuts. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 01May2021 02:45 PM, within a few minutes of receiving his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the patient became slightly dizzy and a bit sick to my stomach (likely from the dizzy feeling). Since it occurred within minutes, he was assuming it was an allergic reaction to the vaccine itself. He was obviously nervous about getting his second dose now. Often times anaphylaxis occurs the 2nd time you encounter a reaction inducing stimuli. No treatment received. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome was recovered on May2021. This case was reported as not serious.   No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

He        was supposed to get his 2nd vaccine on 5/21/21 and had to go out of town and was going to get it when he got back.  The next day 5/23/21 at 12:00 AM his throat began to swell up and gradually it moved from his throat to his chest area.  He went to the ER on 5/23/21 in Hospital and they looked at his throat, gave him a steroid shot and some antibiotics and sent him home.  The next morning he drove back to home and continued taking the antibiotics that they prescribed and his throat kept swelling more and more.  On Tuesday 5/25 at 1:00 PM he went to the ER and sat there 8 hours without being seen and decided to leave.  The next morning 5/26/21 he went to an UC and they sent him to an ER at Hospital and from there he was sent to another ER by ambulance to have emergency throat surgery.

He took a shower and lost his balance twice in the shower because he was dizzy. He was able to make it to work. At work, he started having a headache. It started to get worse. The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol. He took two 500mg tablets again. He didn&#39;t have any energy sitting at his desk doing nothing. He was not able to look at his computer because of the headache. He could not work on 08Jan2021.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

He also reported nausea, vomiting, chills, body ache, no fever.  He went to the ER (emergency room) and was treated with fluids and other meds.&#34; The patient wanted to know whether the symptoms would be worse with the second shot and if they were more commonly reported after the second shot?

His head was hurting so bad that it was more than a migraine and he was vomiting, body ache but way worse than anyone that he has ever talked to, that has had it. He had to go to the hospital for it, it was bad.&#34; The reporter stated that the date of hospitalization was &#34;yesterday 26Jan2021.&#34; The reason for hospitalization was not confirmed further. When asked about the outcome of the events the reporter stated, &#34;A little bit better but not much&#34;. The reporter wanted to know whether &#34;this was a common thing, are you seeing this happening?&#34; The clinical outcome of the events &#34;debilitating headache&#34;, &#34;body ache&#34;, &#34;vomiting&#34;, &#34;nausea&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; were all not recovered/not resolved.

Had first COVID-19 vaccination on 2/13.  Cannot exclude paraneoplastic syndrome; possible hilar mass noted on CXR will need further work-up to rule out sarcoid/malignancy. Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

                                                After taking my 2nd Shot for Booster on the morning of Friday the 5th of 2021. I ate and hydrated for the day. At home I was resting when standing up I was overwhelmed with dizziness, nausea, sweats, and then the chills and heat hit. My inner core felt frozen. I couldn&#39;t move after standing up and the chills locked every bone in my body I couldn&#39;t breathe. Terrified doesn&#39;t cover how afraid I was at that moment. Teeth chattering, fingers rigid, and my back was solid. After moments in this state, I put on layers of sweaters to warm myself. The outside temperature was 65-70*C. So not that bad. I was in shock and not long after putting on my sweaters. My skin felt like it was sun burned and all the weight of the clothing was painful.  I could not lay down, or even roll on my side for rest. Even standing up made my spin hurt.  The muscles in my lower back seized up and the pain was right in the middle of my spin. (The ER Doctors checked and I do not have kidney stones.) I was fighting 99.3&#43; temp and rising. (This temp is accurate. I have phot evidence.)  There was no sleep that Friday night.  Saturday morning I called the first available chiropractor and went to that appointment at 2pm.  As a new client they don&#39;t want to go all out in the first session, but I was in pain with every breathe.  Hyperventilating and over breathing was causing issues with my head and stomach.  The session was amazing, electro therapy mixed with heavy cracks worked on by a professional did help, but only for a brief period of time. Walking away from the building I was still in more pain than ever.  My dad arrived to take me to the ER at roughly 6pm.   Doctors gave me fluid and anti inflammatory drip. Potassium and Tylenol.   It worked. The pain was unreal and I welcomed anything to end the suffering.

At present he is essentially symptoms free.  The EKG showed right bundle branch block and all septal myocardial infarction.  The right bundle branch block is new compared to his last EKG.  The initial troponin was mildly increased at 0.18 and BNP was 118. The renal function is normal with a creatinine of 0.8 and the chest x-ray shows bilateral interstitial opacities which might represent pulmonary edema. He remains admitted

                                                After the first dose, I experienced only mild fatigue and a mild headache within a couple hours of the injection. Later within 10 hours, I developed strong injection site direness that affected my sleep but abated within 12 hours. Therefore, I was expecting more or less similar symptoms with the second dose. Instead, I felt absolutely nothing for nearly twelve hours until I fondly felt mild injection site soreness. I went to bed around 1 am. At around 2 am I awoke with such strong chills that they were almost like convulsions. I was sweating and had a headache.  More concerning though was the tachypnea and wheezing. I was wheezing as if I had asthma to the point that my lunch?s were whistling and I found it difficult to take sufficient breaths. This lasted 30 minutes to one hour before a sting enough that I fell asleep again, still with mild left arm soreness, sweating, mild fever, headache and wheezing. When I awoke a few hours later at around 8 am, I was so fatigued that I could not move. I had a mild headache still but the breathing was better without wheezing and now only hampered by frequent belching (passing off the CO2 buildup from the tachypnea most likely). However, I was so exhausted that I lay in bed for another four hours. When I forced myself up to shower and move, I had a sudden severe depressive attack of uncontrollable crying in the shower. I also had body aches throughout the morning. These symptoms are the same or similar to those felt when I had COVID, so I knew them and that they should pass, yet I did not expect them to be so strong  and the tachypnea with wheezing was initially very disconcerting until it began to ease.  By approximately 11 hours later,  all symptoms had passed.

                                                Hey guys, just a heads up if you know anyone with a CPAP machine who just received a second dose of the vaccine.   I received the shot on Friday.  No reaction all day.  No reaction all day Saturday.  Saturday/Sunday night I started vomiting into my CPAP mask/machine while still asleep. I wouldn?t have woken up unless my wife was there to hear me choking. She cleaned out my mask and had me lay on my side all night while monitoring me.  Scary stuff. Just thought you should make your friends with apnea aware. I still don?t remember the incident at all. I have a mild fever right now, 99.8. I used to tell my wife she saved my life, but now I don&#39;t mean it figuratively. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I passed out Saturday night.  I was standing in the kitchen and the next thing I knew I was on the ground.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

Lasted about 5-10 minutes, and have felt worn down with a mild headache the rest of the day. I wouldn?t think it?s vaccine related, but this has never happened to me before.

                                                I received the vaccine Saturday afternoon. During the 15 minute waiting period I was warm but not feverish. No further adverse affects noticed for the remainder of the day. Sunday my left arm was sore at the injection site but no other issues. Sunday night/Monday morning I woke up at 1:30am and had diarrhea. I returned to bed and tossed and turned for another hour. I woke up at 2:30am and vomited. I had a restless night sleep for the remainder of the night. Monday I couldn?t get out of bed and suffered from chills. Tuesday I was tired but relatively fine. Wednesday I felt pretty much normal. Thursday was fine.

                                                About 7 minutes post 1st dose vaccination, patient began to feel lightheaded, clammy, tingling, nauseas, and diaphoretic. He was brought to lay down and vitals were taken. His vitals were stable and upon laying down he began to feel better. He stated he felt tingling in his left arm but it was just for a few minutes. He denies any numbness, rash, CP, SOB, HA, or palpitations. Patient reports he usually has a vaso vagal reaction when he gets his blood drawn. He felt better about ten minutes of laying down and water was provided. He declined transportation to the hospital but agreed to follow up with his PCP or the ER if he has worsening symptoms. Patient was stable upon leaving the vaccination POD.

After both shots, roughly 24-48 hours after I started having similar symptoms. After I would eat, typically lunch/mid-day, I would get a fever. This would involve sweating, upset stomach, sometimes diarrhea, and possibly a headache. I would basically have to lie down or take a short nap. So far, it has been worse after my second shot, but similar. I just thought it was odd that it happened only after I ate, and I haven&#39;t seen much about that side effect.

Fever dropped to high 99&#39;s, body aches subsided, and skin soreness was gone almost completely.

                                                I had pain at the injection site the evening of receiving the injection, which still continues, though not too bad. Walking up today at around 7 am, I felt headache, achy all over, weakness, and some fever. I decided to stay home. I lay in bed most of the day, sometimes sleeping, sometimes watching YouTube videos on my phone. I was feeling kind of cold, so I snuggled completely under the covers, head and all. I got sweaty and had to uncover my head. I changed clothes. I got up a couple of times to urinate. Once, I felt some weakness, and had to support myself with my hand on the edge of the bathroom counter. Then, this afternoon, my headache was a bit worse. I got up to hop top the bathroom. I was urinating standing up, when I started feeling weak, so I supported myself with my hand, but almost immediately, I started feeling like I was going to fall, to faint, and to vomit. I hurriedly sat down on the toilet. I was still feeling nauseated and weak, so I learned back to take pressure off my abdomen, which was feeling slightly bloated. The bathroom fan was on, so it felt rather cold, but I started getting hotter and hotter, sweating profusely. At the same time, I just sat there trying to recover, and started feeling pins and needles in my forearms, but not like they had fallen asleep, just like someone were pressing down on my arms with blunt needles. I thought I was going to have to crawl back to bed.  After a while, I started cooling off and feeling a little better. I went back to my room and changed clothes. I&#39;m feeling warm and a bit weak and achy again, but nothing like that. I had only drunk 3 cups of water today, though I drank about 7 yesterday.

                                                I had difficulty swallowing with pain in my neck. I had a severe headache and was extremely fatigued. It started Jan 8 2021 and it continued until I sought medical help from multiple physicians. I had a headache for over 90 straight days. I had a nogol in my neck, it ended up being diagnosed as acute thyroiditis.  I am in a lull right now after I was able to stop the medicine. My thyroid is functioning again, but we are waiting for it to go into the hyper thyroid stage.

                                                On Saturday. May 29, I experienced pain similar to appendicitis. I drove to the nearest ER where after 29 minutes, I could barely walk from pain. After 2-3 hours of testing, it was found that my right kidney had a renal infarct and that I had lost up to 25% of my kidney to necrosis. I am not sure if this is an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I wanted to enter it into the system just to be safe.
