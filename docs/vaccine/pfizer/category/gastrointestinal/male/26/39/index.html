A 26-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EK9231; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 20:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. He received his first dose (age of vaccination was 26-year-old) of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as Pfizer BioNtech COVID 19 Vaccine; lot number: EH9899; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 24Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s family history included his father has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received the vaccine in a university hospital which set up a clinic. The patient reported that he thought he got his second dose last night at about 8 pm and since then in the morning around 8 am, so about 12 hours after he started having flu like symptoms that got pretty bad one point. He took some acetaminophen (TYLENOL) so it has gotten better but he was having myalgia, headache, fever, chills and nausea. The patient further mentioned that first, he started having chills around 8 am in the morning. He had chills before but now he kind of overheated and now he is not under a blanket anymore, so he thinks that is improved. He then started having nausea, then myalgia and then everything kind of got bad all at once. He mentioned that over all everything has improved except the headache. He further added that everything has not gone away complete but improved significantly. Earlier today (14Jan2021) like 2-3 hours ago he would say it was a 7 or 8 on a scale of 0-10 but right now it is about 4 on a scale of 0-10 and that goes for everything. He does not think anything else is confounding, he is not on any medications and has no chronic health problems, there has been no labs drawn. The patient did not visit an emergency room and physician office. The outcome of the outcome of the event headache was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovering.

                                                About half an hour after receiving 2nd dose, I started to feel a little nauseous and my throat felt like it was tightening a bit. It was nothing too major, but I did call paramedics to monitor me. The episode subsided about a half hour after that.  However, I did have a more severe episode a few days later on March 5th, in which I had to receive urgent care. It was shortly after lunch which included a spicy hot sauce I had a little bit of.  I started having a similar reaction as earlier described, which eventually subsided once at the doctors office for a bit. However, it did lead to a panic attack, which is something I had never had before.  Overall, I had never reacted like this before. I am wondering if one the side effects of the vaccine may be causing it.

                                                Per his parents, patient started feeling nauseous an hour or two after the vaccine and at night around 10pm it worsened where he felt nauseous, had shivers and he vomited in the middle of the night. He then vomited again the next day and continued to not feel well the next couple of days. On 4/20/2021 at around 4:20pm he called his mother, his girlfriend and his mentor that he was not feeling well, was nauseous and dizzy and had shivers and was going to pull over on his car to get something to drink. He then stopped answering his phone and was found dead in his car later on that day. Police is investigating the case.

                                                Diarrhea; Belching/burping; Significant abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program received from a contactable consumer (reported for himself). A 27-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL0140; expiry date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 08Jan2021 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. There were no medical history and concomitant medications. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient experienced significant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting last night at 14Jan2021 20:00. Significant abdominal pain was the first symptom he had. Significant abdominal pain and nausea went away and came back in waves. He had not vomited since midnight. The patient experienced diarrhea which started 07:00 this morning (15Jan2021). Now (15Jan2021), he was burping, it was like weird belching. He wanted to know if these were normal side effects from the vaccine. He was looking at the list and saw nausea as a listed potential side effect, but he did not see diarrhea, vomiting. Therefore, he was calling to see if it is plausible these events were related to the COVID vaccine. The patient di not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 15Jan2021; outcome of the events nausea, diarrhea, and significant abdominal pain was not recovered; and outcome of event belching/burping was unknown.

Became nauseated and then started quickly oscillating between feeling hot and cold. Sat up in bed and when he did, felt &#39;&#39;everything move to my toes&#39;&#39;. Remained conscious for about 2-3 seconds and then woke up on the floor in a pool of sweat about 5 minutes later (knows the timespan based on looking at his watch when he went to the bathroom and when he woke up). Tried to get up and felt unstable so decided to lay in the floor which he did for about another 10 minutes. During this timeframe, noticed jaw pain and soreness which he attributes to clenching his jaw. At this point, able to struggle into his bed and noted that the oscillation of hot/cold had abated and he was left with a mild headache and fatigue which has slowly improved since that time. At this time, pt reports he feels about 90% of USOH but somewhat &#39;&#39;uneasy&#39;&#39; still. Denies reaction to medication or vaccine in the past other than sulfa abx for which he had skin rashes as a child.

                                                27 year old male received his second shot today and immediately after the shot felt nausea lightheaded and dizzy. He says it feels like the room is spinning around him. He does not have any PMH nor does he state that he takes any medication. He denies any street or illegal drug use. Pt states that he had a couple drinks last night and did not eat anything today. After providing water and laying him down for 30 min he was still symptomatic so it was decided that the patient should be seen in the ED for further workup. Patient is in agreement and he will be sent.   148/101, P 92, O2% 99% 150/101, P 90  ED Note: Physical exam reveals an alert, normocephalic male he has a normal heart rate with normal heart sounds, normal pulmonary effort, lung sounds are clear abdomen is soft he does have some tenderness in the epigastric area no rigidity or distention is noted.  Patient is neurologically intact he is alert and oriented x3, able to ambulate unassisted with a normal gait, sensation is intact, strength is 5 out of 5 in both upper and lower extremities bilaterally, no pronator drift, cerebellar function intact with finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin test.  Posterior oropharyngeal area shows uvula is midline there is no swelling airway is patent.   This is an atypical presentation if the patient is actually having an reaction to the vaccination however I am also concerned for possible abdominal issue we will work him up for ACS as well.  We will give patient a dose of Benadryl to see if that helps with some of his symptoms Bentyl for the stomach cramping and spasming and some fluids.   Lab work was unremarkable patient had a negative troponin&#39;s EKG was negative for STEMI, ischemic changes T wave abnormalities, lactate was normal, lipase was normal.  Patient still complaining of abdominal spasms but states he is feeling better than when he first arrived and would like to go home.  Patient states that his abdominal spasms have happened intermittently over the last few years he has had multiple imaging of his stomach and that he feels comfortable being discharged with the intention that if anything worsens he would return here to the emergency department.

                                                The female medical employee, who was administering the vaccination.  The Pfizer Vaccination. Opened a shot syringe. That had an empty vile. The syringe did not have the dosage of vaccine. The female medical employee, documented on my immunization card the sticker Lot number #EN6204, but the vaccine Lot Number (the syringe received) was not the Lot Number indicated on the immunization card. Why? The female medical employee, called over the military personnel whom was being the security for the vaccination site. The female military personnel was holding an open unit syringe vile dosage of the vaccine. The female medical employee showed the empty syringe vaccine to the military personnel. She said, &#34;The dosage fell out.&#34; The female medical employee, took the open package, of the syringe vile, that contained a measured dose of the vaccine. Which is not considered the full dosage, or considered a safe dosage of the vaccine, because the package was opened. Not in front of the patient. And. Was open, when the military personnel, who was holding this vile, was walking, with the open package, around without proper medical gear. The medical employee. Quickly took out the syringe. Didn&#39;t explain which and what that syringe was, and just injected the dosage into my arm.  I know, that practice was malpractice. I know I experienced malpractice. And. It&#39;s obvious the Government is going to do anything about it. This is not a petty situation. I don&#39;t know where that needle from. What has been introduced to that open syringe package. I did experience very bad side affects:  headaches, muscle pains, tiredness, fatigue, weakness, low strength, dizziness, partial blindness, overwhelming stress, back pain, joint pain,  spinal pain, chills, fever like symptoms, nausea, spontaneous  pain, soreness in the arm, swelling throughout my body, difficulty breathing, short breaths.

                                                27 year old male with Down&#39;s Syndrome and no other past medical history received second COVID-19 vaccine on 4/27/2021. On 4/30/2021 began &#34;feeling poorly&#34; with nausea/vomiting and possible chest discomfort. Originally presented to ED on morning of 4/30 - EKG completed demonstrated diffused ST elevation. Patient was transferred to Medical Center for heart catheterization. Left heart catheterization demonstrated normal coronary arteries and LVEDP of 25. Stat ECHO demonstrated pericardial effusion and concern raised for myopericarditis. Patient subsequently transferred to a different Medical Center for higher level of care. Upon arrival to Medical Center plan was to intubate and take to cath lab for heart biopsy and PA catheter placement. However, upon intubation patient began to decompensate and subsequently developed cardiac arrest. During ACLS, VA ECMO was placed and therapeutic hypothermia was initiated. Following VA ECMO placement patient received IVIG, high dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg), anakinra 100 mg, and broad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn). Despite these efforts the patient continued to have hemodynamic instability and was on high dose vasopressors (epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, angiotensin II, vasopressin). Patient subsequently suffered another cardiac arrest, briefly regained pulse with high dose vasopressors, but subsequently lost pulse despite best efforts and died on 5/1/2021 at approximately 13:00.

An ECHO was performed and LVEF was 45%, and an EKG showed possible ST elevation. Per the Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine study there were no reports of STEMI being an adverse effect. Given the patient&#39;s ejection fraction of 45%, there was likely a prior medical condition the patient was unaware of and may have precipitated the STEMI rather than the vaccine . Hospitalized for 2 days and diagnosed with pericarditis.

                                                I was feeling fine for most of the day. The next day I woke up in sweats and chills but I didn?t think much of it. As I was standing up I notice all of the following-  headaches, body pain, fever, low energy (although this one went away fast). I also felt like puking most of the day. I woke up at 7am and After work I took a nap. I woke up at 7pm feeling a lot better.  I still had some minor headache but it went away with Advil.

After the first dose, the patient became &#34;deathly sick&#34; with the following: high fever, throwing up, massive migraine. These symptoms occurred approximately 5-7 days post vaccination. The patient went to ER (emergency room) and was given IV fluid for dehydration, no other diagnosis, but was told it could be related to the dose of vaccine. The outcome of the events deathly sick, high fever, throwing up, massive migraine and dehydration was unknown.  The lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

                                                At around 1:30 in the morning, i became really weak, achey, had the chills, some nausea, a minor headache, a slight sore throat, and  minor eye pain like they were dry. Though i I felt terrible, the most concerning side effect was that my skin felt like it was extremely raw in patches all over my body where if my sheets lightly touched one of those ?patches?, it would be very painful. However, there was no rash or discoloration from what I could tell. I also had strange painful sensations at the ends of my toes but were different in quality relative to the hypersensitive/raw painful sensations on my skin. The adverse events kept me awake for hours but when I finally got to sleep and woke up the next morning.  I only had chills, weakness, and acheyness which were much less in severity than those early morning hours. It is now 4:45 pm and the only adverse effect I am still feeling is the fatigue. Also, I forgot to mention it on the medication portion but I had taken 400 mg of ibuprofen about 15 minutes before receiving that second dose.

                                                After leaving the vaccination clinic following the 15 minute waiting period, I felt normal and ran a quick errand before returning to work. After completing the errand (roughly 15 minutes), I began driving back to my office (roughly 10 minute drive). As I was roughly 1/2 mile from the office, I started to feel slightly lightheaded/woozy. I continued to drive toward the office, and within a matter of a couple minutes or less, I was overcome with extreme disorientation and faintness. Before I could manage to return to the office or pull over to collect myself, I completely lost consciousness and crashed into another vehicle. Even after the crash, I was unconscious for roughly a minute or so until I finally came to and realized what had happened. It then took me another couple of minutes to collect myself and exit the vehicle to assess the situation and ensure all parties were alright. Police/Emergency services were contacted and a police report was filed. After the event, I remained slightly nauseated for approximately 3 hours and had intermittent chill episodes, but the adverse events have since subsided.

                                                The vaccination was administered on Saturday evening, December 19th, 2020. The next morning around 10 am I began to feel nauseous and light-headed. That feeling waxed and waned all day and improved in the evening. The next morning on Monday, December 21st I was 10/10 nauseous and near vomiting. I went to work but had to leave because of nausea. Ultimately I vomited upon returning home and was nauseous with abdominal pain and achy all day. The next morning on Tuesday, December 22 nausea continued but with a rating of around 6/10. Then came the intense headache, body aches, and fatigue. This continued into the next day  (Wednesday, December 23) prompting me to get COVID tested and take off of work on Thursday, December 24th. Nausea improved (5/10)  on December 24th but fatigue, abdominal pain,  and body aches did not. December 25-27 were slow improvements with nausea, abdominal pain, and fatigue but were limiting activities of daily living. By Monday, December 28th most symptoms had cleared.

All of that is now better except for the cough. It is now 4 days after the vaccine, and it seems the vaccine has triggered an asthma attack requiring inhaled albuterol. My asthma attacks typically linger for a couple weeks after upper respiratory infections, and this feels exactly like that, I wouldn?t be surprised if this asthma attack persists for a couple of weeks.

Also felt unusually anxious, though unsure if that was directly due to the vaccine or to the inability to sleep for a number of days because of the feverish chills. Acute symptoms lasted for 48 hours, and prohibited me from being able to work from home.   I still have what feels like a lingering sinus headache (with no actual sinus symptoms) as well as some fatigue. Lingering headache is not debilitating, but it is irritating. Feels a bit like a sensation of pressure in my forehead.

                                                Patient received his 1 dose of Pfizer vaccine and was waiting in our lobby for the recommended 15 minutes. He fainted after about 10 minutes. He fell from the bench to the floor where he landed on his stomach. When I ran over to him, his eyes were open but his body was limp. I tapped his back and asked if he was ok, and he was startled as if I woke him up from sleep. He was alert and was able to speak, he asked for water and I gave it to him. I asked of he wanted me to call emergency services but he declined. He then vomited in the waiting room trash can. His sister was with him and began to rub his back and fan him. I asked again if he needed to go to the hospital and again her declined. I told them to please wait in the lobby at least another 15 minutes before leaving and he did. I called to patient around 8pm to check on him and he said he was fine and had no more symptoms.

                                                11pm on day of (Sunday) vaccination felt soreness in left arm at injection site and in entire upper arm when trying to hold it up. Soreness subsided by noon the next day, Monday. No symptoms on Tuesday until late evening when tongue began to feel sore. On Wednesday morning around 6am, woke up with severe body fever, chills, muscle and joint aches, nausea, headache. Hands and fingers very cold to the touch. Severe fatigue and weakness all day. Sore tongue persisted. No respiratory symptoms present. By Thursday (today), body is still feverish, joint and muscle aches persist, light headache at times. Still fatigued and weak. All symptoms today Thursday are much weaker except for the muscle and joint pain which remains high.  The reason I am reporting this is that from what I&#39;ve read and been told, the delayed onset of these symptoms (almost 3 days) is very unusual, especially because I had little/no symptoms in the first 2 days of the vaccine.

                                                more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine; Purple splotches; Dizzy and woozy; Nausea; Headache; Feels awful/slow motion; Tired; Sluggish; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 30-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 22Mar2021 at 12:30 at the age of 30 years-old, (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation  .  Medical history included dyspepsia from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Severe Heartburn , blood pressure measurement from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Verbatim: Blood pressure , migraine from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril (LISINOPRIL) taken for blood pressure for 3 years and ongoing; pantoprazole (PANTOPRAZOLE) taken for stomach medication and heartburn for about a year. Patient states he got the first round 3 weeks ago and he is supposed to get the second dose next Monday but was advised by his doctor not to do that.      Patient states he got the shot on Monday 22Mar2021 and Tuesday 23Mar2021 he was tired and sluggish. On Wednesday 24Mar2021, mid afternoon, he had purple splotches all over his body, in arms and legs, like discoloration, his head felt like it had been dipped in cement and he couldn&#39;t think. States he felt cloudy, dizzy and woozy, nauseous, had a headache and feeling awful. States this occurred like 48 hours after the shot. He contacted a life long friend who is a doctor and works in a covid ward and he told him he was having a reaction and to take some Benadryl and Advil or Tylenol, and the friend told the patient to lay down and rest. He still didn&#39;t feel great but splotches went away and head felt a little bit clearer and he didn&#39;t feel like he was in slow motion or dizzy anymore by Wednesday evening, so he went to bed. On Thursday, the patient went into work but didn&#39;t feel great, not feeling 100%, and about noon on Thursday 25Mar2021, the symptoms started coming back, the purple splotches, his head felt just as bad, he had a headache, slow motion and not himself. The patient called his doctor and his friend and they said he needed to go in and get looked at. The patient tried to go into an urgent care and he states they said nope head to the ER. Patient states he was admitted into the ER and the ER staff said he was having more than likely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. They gave him steroids and an IV but he is not sure what it is and he was given, he thinks, Prednisone over the next couple days to help with side effects, he believes it was Prednisone, he knows it was a steroid. States he is not a fan of it and he doesn&#39;t like it at all. Patient states that he thought it was a pretty standard reaction and was not worried about it. Patient states he still gets headaches and maybe it&#39;s something else that is unrelated. States he stopped feeling tired and sluggish maybe the 29Mar2021, a week afterwards. Patient states that he has recovered with lasting effects as he&#39;s been getting migraines since then, states maybe it&#39;s unrelated but didn&#39;t happen a whole lot before. He has severe headaches and nothing he takes seems to help, has to turn lights off and works from home and patient reports that he had one yesterday. Patient states the purple splotches went away after he went to the ER and got on the medicine, the steroids.  P atient states the nausea was pretty constant when a headache comes on, he doesn&#39;t have a headache every day but when he gets a headache he is definitely nauseous.  The outcome of the events was for fatigue and sluggish, recovered with sequela, Purple splotches, dizzy and woozy slow motion, recovered, nausea and headache not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 31-year-old male patient received his second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 11Jan2021 at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). Medical history included ongoing HIV since 2015. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; unknown lot number and expiration date), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for front line worker (covid-19 immunization). The patient reported that he received his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine last Monday (11Jan2021) between 8:00 am and 8:30 am, and since then he has been sick and has been experiencing some side effects. He mentioned that he has been in contact with someone who is Covid-19 positive on an unspecified date. He works at the front desk registration in a hospital. He has been tired and fatigued, has had a low-grade fever, vomiting, headache, cough and chest tightness. He added that on Monday evening (11Jan2021), he became tired and fatigued. He had an on and off fever on Tuesday (12Jan2021). He started vomiting while coughing on 12Jan2021. He went to the doctor last night (13Jan2021) and he said he got tested for Covid-19 on 13Jan2021, but the results came out negative. The physician said that it would. However, his physician said that it was too early to tell if he has been infected since he has just been exposed last Monday. Normally, they like to have a 5 day turn around for a true reading. He said his physician told him he just needed to quarantine. He mentioned that his chest feels tight when he coughs on 13Jan2021. When he had to take deep breaths while the doctor was listening to him breath his chest was tight. He had blood work drawn at the doctor&#39;s office, but he does not have any results to provide. The patient wanted to know what he needs to do about this. He was inquiring if there any recommendations. He is probably negative because he is symptomatic. His employer said it may be a reaction from the shot. The outcome of the events sickness and exposure to COVID-19 were unknown, as for the event vomiting was recovered on 12Jan2021 while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.    The following information on the batch/lot number has been requested.

Woke up the next day with mild to severe body aches, muscle soreness, joint pain and pain in my stomach/abdomen. Developed a 101 fever 24 hrs after receiving the vaccine, and continued until this morning (3/16). Vomiting multiple times in the middle of the night on 3/14. The vomiting was only a one night deal, but every other symptom that I experienced has been persistent until this morning. I feel about 80% back at the moment. Symptoms were very similar, maybe even a little more extreme, than the ones I experienced when I contracted Covid months ago, but they didn?t last as long.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on 04Jan2021, this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional, the patient, from a Pfizer sponsored program IBCC (Inbound Call Center for HCPs).  A 32-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EK5730), intramuscular in the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at 21:00 (at the age of 32-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing hypertension from 2009 and COVID-19 from 10Jun2020 to an unknown date in 2020.  Ongoing concomitant medications included fosinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for hypertension from 2017. The patient did not receive any other vaccines on the same day as the BNT162B2 vaccine.  On 19Dec2020, shy of about 96 hours of getting the vaccine, the patient experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and chills. He did not have any fever. The patient stated that he recovered from the fatigue, body aches, headache and chills by 19Dec2020. The patient was fine from 19Dec2020 until 01Jan2021. On 28Dec2020, the patient had a COVID-19 PCR test that came back negative. On 01Jan2021, the patient suspected that he had COVID-19. He had a fever of 103.1 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, chills like he was freezing to death, fatigue, diarrhea; however, he did not have nausea or loss of taste or smell. He had swollen lymph nodes, but no sore throat and his oxygen saturation was okay in Jan2021.  He was also having chest pain but it was more like intercoastal pain. He stated that these current symptoms were significantly worse than the ones he had just after getting the vaccine and felt more like the symptoms he had when he had COVID-19 before on 10Jun2020 (positive IgG for COVID-19-tested in 2020). The patient had a COVID nasal swab (PCR) done at an urgent care (physician&#39;s office) on 02Jan2020 or 03Jan2020 and was awaiting the results. The clinical outcome of the suspected COVID-19 was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between reported suspected COVID-19 cannot be excluded.

A 33-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot numbers and expiry dates were unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Dec2020 for the first dose and on 08Jan2021 for the second dose, both administered in the right arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history and no concomitant medications. The patient had no known allergies to medications, food, or other products.

I was feeling feverish by the end of the day, a slight head ache,  clammy, mental fog, exhausted. The following day I had waves of nausea, and each of the previously reported symptoms were stronger. The headache grew stronger and I was relatively useless, feeling very ill. By the next day the 16th most of the symptoms had cleared up. I had a slight headache and felt a bit tired, but much better. By the 18th, I was back to normal with the only symptom being a sore arm.

                                                About an hour after I received my second shot I felt extremely hot and my knees and elbows started to hurt. I felt so hot that I walked outside to my car (about .3 miles away) in freezing cold temperatures with no jacket and didn&#39;t feel the cold at all. I developed a brain fog shortly thereafter and made several mistakes while performing my job throughout the day. My supervisor provided me with extra strength tylenol and within an hour or so the joint pains subsided. By 7 PM that night I had very bad chills and was shaking under a blanket on my couch. My temperature got up to 99.8 which is pretty high for me. I went back and forth between  feeling like I was freezing cold and on fire.  I got very little sleep that night and had disturbing dreams. The following morning all my joints hurt and I felt extreme exhaustion. I laid on my couch all day the day after receiving the shot and felt exhausted and and had no appetite. From 6 PM the day of the shot to 9 PM the following day I ate NOTHING and had no desire to eat. As I&#39;m typing this 60 hours after receiving the second shot the joint pain is  gone, the exhaustion is gone and my appetite is back to normal. There&#39;s a lingering pain at the injection site but otherwise I feel like I did prior to receiving the second shot.

A 33-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EJ1685), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose on right arm, mid bicep for COVID-19 immunization. There were no patient history. Concomitant medications included hepatitis b vaccine on 14Dec2020, colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]), calcium and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient received  first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number:EK5730) on 18Dec2020 (left arm) and he experienced little pain around the injection site, some nausea and some bouts of dizziness. The patient received the Covid 19 Vaccine 4 days after receiving the Hepatitis B vaccination, so he identified this as an error in administration. So the Hepatitis B vaccination was given on 14Dec2020 and the first Covid 19 Vaccine was given on 18Dec2020. He received the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine on 11Jan2021. Patient stated that originally the prescriber who administered it the first two doses had scheduled him to receive the second dose of Covid 19 Vaccine as the same day as his second Hepatitis B Vaccination and he identified this error last Wednesday and stated &#34;I believe or potentially today, I&#39;m not sure which one I&#39;m sorry I had to check with that&#34;. So, he was trying to get this all cleared up. He did report symptoms for both Covid Vaccines as little pain around the injection site, some nausea, some bouts of dizziness. So, patient had already discussed the common adverse reactions with him. Patient was told that co-administration has not been studied yet and referred him to his HCP for continued guidance on how and when to space out the additional Hepatitis B vaccination that he will need. Patient was &#34;32&#34; back in December when this happened. He had his birthday and turned 33. Second shot for the Covid was scheduled the same day the Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) but due to inveigle in-charge of the vaccine, he had lost his paper work and he had been on vacation and stated &#34;had been vaccine was not found they just gave me the second Covid Vaccine and told me to come back by Thursday and I should have found it and have everything cleared up by then but then Wednesday they called me and told me that they have realized that they are not supposed to give vaccine co-administered with 14 days window before or after. I haven&#39;t got my second Hep B (Hepatitis B Vaccine) just the first one was administered within the 4 days period of the first shot&#34;. Patient work at Dietary Providence. The patient had his blood drawn this morning (20Jan2021). Patient does not have product details for hepatitis B vaccine. Patient stated that the nurse on duty had said that the vaccine they had stocks was &#34;Engerix-B hepatitis B recombinant&#34; but that was not verified as far as definitively is just what she had stocked when he was going on his incident report. Patient further stated, &#34;As far as all things are concerned you know I went to a doctor got checked he said breathing was great, heart rate was great, oxygen level 98 percent, he has drawn blood by then is there anything that I should be doing at this point cataloging thing any other test any other people to contact. What should I do going forward specially what can I do to be helpful for you guys to get this situation clear.&#34; Outcome of the events was unknown.

Proton pump inhibitor via IV. Opioid IV in ER. the patient was hospitalized for 3 days. Unremarkable patient history prior to this even for GI and cardio. Non smoker non alcohol user. First ever hospitalization as an adult. On 21Jan2021 the patient had a negative Nasal Swab test for covid. The outcome of the event was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible temporal association and in absence of strong confounding factors, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events fever, abdominal pain and swelling of spleen and liver.

                                                I noticed a headache in the very top of my head within an hour of getting the vaccine. I thought it was normal because everyone I know said they got a headache from it. Over the next few hours, the pain moved down the back of my neck and became a burning sensation at the bottom of my skull. The pain was not excruciating but was constant. I thought it would eventually go away.  I&#39;m a pilot and fly for a living. Two days after receiving the vaccine I flew my plane and immediately noticed something was wrong with me. I was having a very hard time focusing. Approximately 2 hours into my flying I felt sudden and extreme pressure in my head and nearly blacked out. I immediately landed and stopped flying. Two days later I tried flying again and the exact same thing happened again after 20 minutes. The burning in my neck intensified and was now accompanied by dizziness, nausea, disorientation, confusion, uncontrollable shaking, and tinkling in my toes and fingers. I immediately went to my hometown doctor and he diagnosed me with vertigo. He prescribed me meclizine on Friday 02/05/2021.  I took the medicine as prescribed all weekend with no relief. Monday 02/08/2021 I made an appointment for that Wednesday at the Institute. During Wednesday 02/10/2021-02/11/2021 I had roughly 10-15 test performed on me including balance, eye and hearing test, CT scan, MRI, and measured my spinal fluid pressure. The physician determined on 02/11/2021 that I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer COVID vaccine the severely increased the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem. That pressure causes my vision problems and ultimately ruptured my left inner ear breaking off several crystals in the process. I cannot fly with this condition. I&#39;m currently taking Diamox to reduce the pressure in my spinal cord and brain stem.

A 33-year-old male patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech), via an unspecified route of administration, on 01Feb2021 at 11:00 AM, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. Patient had no known allergies and did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. Patient did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. On 01Feb2021 at 12:00 PM the patient developed a headache. Over the next few hours the headache moved to the back of his neck and base of his skull. On 03Feb2021 the patient experienced very hard time focusing his eyes and extreme burning and tingling sensation over his entire body, he was extremely dizzy, confused, nauseous and uncontrollably shaking. Patient  went to his family doctor and was diagnosed with vertigo on 05Feb2021. Patient took meclizine with no relief. On 10Feb2021 the patient was visited by another doctor and went under two days of testing including acoustic stimulation tests, balance test, visual acuity tests, CT scan and MRI all with unknown result. The doctor said the vaccine shot caused an allergic reaction which elevated patient&#39;s spinal cord pressure and brain stem swelling. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of spinal cord pressure and included treatment with Diamox. Outcome of the events was not resolved. The events were considered serious as life-threatening and as per disability. Patient was not tested positive for COVID-19 after vaccination.  The information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I have some mild tinnitus which I&#39;ve had for 15 years since high school and rarely bothers me. Go months without noticing it.   A few hours after my first dose of Pfizer (left arm), I got a headache and some queasiness. The expected side effects. My ears started ringing louder and more pronounced, which I assumed was a side-effect of the headache and/or immune response to the vaccine. It&#39;s past two weeks now since dose 1 and my ears are still ringing much more loudly and noticeably than in the last 15 or so years. All other side effects have long ago subsided. It seems to be worse in left ear, the same side I got shot on. I imagine that&#39;s irrelevant, but mentioning it anyway here.   Distracting and distressing.  Am scheduled for a second dose on April 21 and now hesitant about getting it.

A 33-year-old patient (husband) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 05Apr2021 15:40 (Lot Number: ER8734) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atopic dermatitis. Concomitant medication included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), an injection that patient takes every other week to control his atopic dermatitis, he has been using this for 3 years at least. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot number: ER6207) in left shoulder on 15Mar2021 15:40, at the age of 32 years old, for COVID-19 immunization, and experienced arm sore and body aches. The patient experienced vomiting blood in Apr2021, blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up / spitting up blood in Apr2021, he feels like his throat is so raw on 05Apr2021, sore arm on 05Apr2021, feeling achy/ her husband is still sore/achy today on 05Apr2021, nauseous on 05Apr2021, vomiting/ throwing up on 05Apr2021, diarrhea on 05Apr2021, chilly in Apr2021, redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids; his pores looked red in Apr2021, fatigue on 05Apr2021. No treatment received for the adverse events. Outcome of the events pain in arm, ache, nauseous, erythema, fatigue was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Clinical course as reported: Her husband got their second dose of the vaccine on 05Apr2021. Her husband was having a more severe reaction than the first time. The first time he got the vaccine his arm was sore. Last night (05Apr2021), the caller&#39;s husband was vomiting just over and over and had diarrhea, both at the same time. Wife added the thing she was worried about was that her husband was vomiting blood as well, and that her husband said it was from the phlegm, like he felt like his throat was so raw. Her husband did not really want to eat anything which she expected was normal. She was trying to give him fluids, and having him drink a little bit. Her husband had not vomited since around 4 am. And right now, he was sleeping. She did not know if she should give him medicine or take him to be seen or if this was a normal reaction to the vaccination. She did read side effects from the paper and she saw that some vomiting was expected but the blood was what caught her off guard. Around 10 o&#39;clock last night (05Apr2021), her husband felt nauseous and went to bed. She actually fell asleep on the couch and heard her husband vomiting across the house, that was how bad the vomiting was. The vomiting started at midnight last night (05Apr2021). Her husband has been vomiting every couple of hours (2 hours), around the clock. Diarrhea had been at the same time. From her understanding, her husband had vomited at least 3 or 4 times, and had diarrhea 3 or 4 times. She kind of lost track after the 3rd time, but she had not heard him since around 4 am Her husband was still sore/achy today (06Apr2020) and was is still nauseous. She believed he was also feeling chilly. He was wrapped up in his blanket. Her husband did not have a fever, she has been checking his temperature. Wife stated no treatment yet, as she did not know what was safe. Her husband wanted to wait until he stopped vomiting because anything he put in his stomach came right back up. After the first time her husband was done throwing up, and was only dry heaving, he started to like kind of spit. When he would gargle or spit, there was blood in the phlegm or just whatever he spit up. The first time the wife went to check on him, she saw him spitting up blood. It was not like his vomit was red with blood in it, it was just the after effects, so she thought she should call and report this. Each time he has vomited, there was still that spit up of blood afterwards. The patient himself clarified the vomiting was last around 4 am (06Apr2020), give or take, and the last stool/bout of diarrhea was around 7 am (06Apr2020). He was still feeling nauseous and fatigued. He added that after the first time he vomited and the couple times he checked later on, he looked in the mirror and saw that there was this redness around his eyes, like under his eyelids. He adds it was red, it wasn&#39;t like splotchy, but it was like his pores looked red, like pinpoints. The patient clarified that the fatigue and achiness probably started around the first time he vomited, and that was still hanging around. The wife stated this was better than him getting Covid. Wife added what she was trying to see was if she should take her husband to the hospital or not. She did not want to wait too long, but if this was something that was a side effect that was expected, then her husband could just sleep it off.

As I am driving out of the parking lot, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/nauseous, and my vision becomes extremely blurry, even to the point of near blindness. I stopped the car and sat for about 30 seconds/1 minute until my vision returned sufficiently to drive back to the waiting area where I requested water. I immediately felt better with the water, and the staff also gave me benadryl although I don&#39;t think it had any impact. I felt weak for an additional 30 minutes or so and spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. I felt fine to drive after this 30 minutes and have had no side effects since.&#34; Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of even to the point of near blindness, suddenly begin to sweat profusely, feeling weak/felt weak, nauseous and my vision becomes extremely blurry. No treatment was reported for the event spent much of that time in the bathroom with diarrhea. Outcome of the events was recovered on 31Mar2021.

I got a severe reaction from the Pfizer vaccine. I got the normal chills the next day and flu symptoms. From the next day to day 5 I got severe headaches, strong pain in my head, my left arm and left eye. I took Tylenol and ibuprofen within those days. The Tylenol didn&#39;t help at all, ibuprofen 200mg didn&#39;t do much. Yesterday I went to the ER because I had light pressure during the morning in my head not as severe as the other days, in the afternoon I had a tight pressure in my head so I took 2 tablets of extra strength Tylenol, the headache went away but within an hour I had a bad reaction. My whole body turned red, bumps, itchy. It was bad.  It was bizarre because I&#39;ve never had reaction to Tylenol prior. I never had that before yesterday. It was the first time. They gave me a shot of steroids. The doctor didn&#39;t know if it was a bad reaction to the Pfizer reaction (said it would usually occur within 4 hours of getting the vaccine) or the mix of the Tylenol and the pfizer vaccine together. He had no clue. But he had not seen a reaction of the vaccine at 5 days later. He said I could have reacted late, or the Tylenol and Pfizer vaccine together had a bad reaction.  I had covid late Jan of this year. The vaccine more interaction due to that if I had immunity to it. It was so bad I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible to wait 2 months for the 2nd shot. I heard the first dose 80-90 percent immunity or even more. With my body I never had this reaction. Today I&#39;m a whole lot better (day 6). I am too putting too much, should I wait 90 days other say 4 weeks. What to do about the 2nd dose? How about using antihistamines during/after my second dose? What about Tylenol or Ibuprofen?&#34;  I had a side effect after the first dose of the vaccine.  Should I get the second dose?  e-transmitting potential duplicate AE.

States he had been reading a lot and is really worried about taking the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and is debating on waiting two  months before getting the 2nd one and his general practitioner can&#39;t find anything wrong and can&#39;t say the reported event is due to  the Pfizer Vaccine; states a lot of people get a reaction in 6 days he has found in his reading; states his HCP has some patients that  had reactions within 4 hours and not in 5 days after the vaccine and states he has no patient information or lot numbers for their  vaccines to report.

                                                I received my shot at 3:30 PM on 01/09/21.  I felt very tired on 01/12/21 before that went away that evening.  I began feeling dizzy and nauseus around 8:00 PM Monday, 01/11/21, and again periodically on 01/12/21.  The dizzy and nausea feeling continued consistently throughout 01/12/21 and 01/13/21.  I went to my primary care provider on 01/12/21 who gave me medication to help with nausea and dizziness.  She chalked it up to anxiety.  I became more worried on the evening of 01/13/21 and went to the ER.  The ER doctor stated it could be a reaction to the vaccine, inflammation in the ear/calcium buildup in the ear, or just my anxiety.  I do want to note I was nervous about getting this shot and have a history of having trouble distinguishing between true issues I am having and issues caused by my anxiety.  As of today, 01/15/21, I took Methazine which seems to have helped the dizziness, but not completely.  I am not currently nauseus.

He said that he felt a little dizzy and hot and started to feel nauseous. The pharmacist gave him a cold compress and had him lie on the ground and elevate his feet. After about 10 minutes the patient said he felt fine so we helped him back in his chair and asked that he stay longer for us to monitor him. He waiting an additional 15 minutes and said he felt fine and left.

So, no unusual side effect for 24h, then experienced on Friday night: headaches, chills, body ache, fatigue. Took 650 mg of acetaminophen. Same symptoms on Saturday with increase in intensity, plus mild fever in the evening at 99.6 F (instead of 97.4 F which is &#34;my normal&#34;), nausea, painful eye balls, sensitivity to light and noise, loss of appetite. Took 650 mg tabs of  acetaminophen throughout the day per bottle instruction.  Extreme fatigue Saturday night and severe headaches, fever at 100.2 F that night, treated with acetaminophen. By Sunday night temperature was 100.9 F, extreme fatigue and severe headaches and painful eye balls, heart rate racing up to 120 BPM when moving from bathroom to living room. Went back down to 65 BPM after about 1min at rest. Tried massages of upper body to loosen muscle, seemed to help with bodyache. Spent Saturday through Tuesday at home. Rapid covid 19 test negative. Back to work on Wednesday.

                                                2nd dose administered Thursday Jan 14th @ 2pm. Symptoms started  Friday Jan 15th  @ 0630 am. Became extremely lightheaded/dizzy. Became nauseous. Felt as I was going to pass out. Made it to bathroom as I thought I was going to vomit. Essentially collapsed on floor and had severe rigors/uncontrollable shaking throughout entire body for 30 minutes. Felt as I was being electrocuted, it was extremely intense and could feel it through every part of my body. Teeth were clenched entire time and could barely open mouth. Attempted to get up multiple times but could not make it past getting on my knees. Laid on floor  until shaking eventually subsided. Had severe headache after (i assume it was from clenching teeth for 30 min). Extreme fatigue.  Was sent to ER per policy for covid test - results negative. Sent home from work per policy. Slept remainder of day. Woke up @ 5 pm feeling substantially better.

Took OTC acetaminophen and NDAIDs. Visited employees health who sent me to urgent care for neurological exam. Urgent care physician noted right arm weaker than left and recorded report of bilateral upper extremity paresthesia. Recommended follow up exam and cervical MRI if symptoms worsen or do not resolve within 7 days. Neck pain has improved but still present. Paresthesias still present. Right arm (dominant arm) still weaker than left. Will follow up with primary care physician this week if symptoms continue.  Additional side effects: headache, dizziness, nausea, shivers, fatigue, joint pain (all resolved within 72 hours).

                                                Severe abdominal pain.  The shot was given at approx 11 am.  Abdominal pain started around 6 pm, gradually got worse.  At 1 am I was awoken in pain and I took hydrocodone leftover from a previous surgery in hopes of making it to the morning for urgent care.  (ER Bills)  At 4 am I was re-awoken in even worse pain, decided I was about to die, and went to the ER.  Cold sweat on way to ER.  Throat dry.  Made it to ER, received Morphine, the first dose calmed the pain down, did not make it go away.  A lot of tests and several hours later, a second dose was given when the pain returned to its terrible state.  Approx 15 min into the second dose pain was finally subsiding (roughly 1 or 2 pm).  Went home and took Tylonal as requested by Docs and filled an Oxy prescription in anticipation of the return of the pain.  This has not happened.  Slept great last night.  Dry Mouth Persists.  Also slight arm tenderness.

                                                Few minutes after receiving injection developed lightheadedness/dizziness, nausea, palpitations, generalized tingling sensation, clamminess.  Upon checking vitals was tachycardic with heart rate in 120s; drop in blood pressure to 100/50 (my baseline is 120/75).  No wheezing. No stridor. Oxygen saturations 99%. No hives or rash. No facial or peripheral swelling.  Provided fluids (by mouth), cold compresses, and benadryl. Gradual improvement after this.  Majority of symptoms lasted for approx 1 to 1.5 hours; with some waxing/waning palpitations for another~1 hour.  I have no prior history of similar symptoms after receiving vaccines or medications in the past.

I am a physician who likely had contracted COVID in 04/2020 and has been suffering long COVID sx since. No significant reaction to dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine other than sore arm. 2nd dose within 12 hours had severe rigors, severe chills, then fever to 39.6 the first night (took 1 dose of tylenol and 1 of advil after), temp of 38-39 the next 12 hours, and then the 2nd night had a fever high of 41.4 degrees (took another tylenol). Had sweats the entire night after and defervesced after. Day 3-5 mostly involve myalgia, nausea, anorexia, malaise, chills, HA, and mild SOB. Took about 1 week to &#34;recover&#34; to my long COVID baseline after the 2nd dose of vaccine. Still having a bit worse SOB now compared to prior to 2nd dose but unsure if it has to do with the vaccine at this point. Had tested for positive anti-spike protein ab (likely from the 1st dose) the morning of my 2nd dose of vaccine.

This has continued to be present now still two weeks following.

The next day it felt slightly better but overnight to Saturday morning it came back horribly and radiated to lower right side to where I could not even sleep on my side. I went to the ER, they did a cat scan and immed told to have emergency surgery to get appedix out. While in surgery they ended up having to do a hemi colectomy due to how bad the appendicitis was.

The pain and heartburn were treated with over the counter medications - ibuprophen, Tylenol, Pepcid and Prilosec at advice of my primary care doctor.  Most all of the symptoms resolved after about two weeks past vaccine except my heartrate/palpitations and heartburn.  My primary care doctor prescribed Protonix to help with the heartburn. Three and half weeks past vaccine I visited the ER thinking I was having a heart attack.

Coli; Unable to tolerate diet; Abdominal pain; Nausea; Vomiting; Muscle aches; Chills; Fever; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician.   A 36-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 06Apr2021 at 10:00, at the age of 36 years old, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diverticulitis ongoing since 05Nov2018. Concomitant drugs included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) ongoing since an unspecified date. There were no other vaccinations 4 weeks prior to receiving BNT162b2. Two days after vaccination, on 08Apr2021, the patient developed nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, and fever. The patient continued to have these symptoms and then developed abdominal pain on 11Apr2021, so the patient went to ER. Nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, chills, fever, and abdominal pain were reported as medically significant events. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed on 11Apr2021, which seemed at that time to reveal only uncomplicated diverticulitis. Therefore, the patient was sent home with oral antibiotics. Then, the patient presented back to ER on 14Apr2021: the patient couldn&#39;t tolerate his diet and was experiencing worsening of abdominal pain. Another CT of abdomen and pelvis was therefore done on 14Apr2021, which this time revealed a thrombus occluding his IMV protruding into part of the SMV and the portal vein. In light of this finding, on 14Apr2021 the medical staff retroactively looked at the patient&#39;s CT scan from 11Apr2021 and they found that the thrombus was already present but less evident than on 14Apr2021. The patient also looked like he was in sepsis, so the medical team was performing a full septic work-up and the patient was hospitalized on 14Apr2021. The patient was terrified, and the medical staff were ruling out acute mesenteric ischemia. On 14Apr2021, blood work showed thrombocytopenia, and a bacteria blood test showed bacteremia with E. Coli. The event thrombus was reported as serious since medically significant, life threatening, and requiring hospitalization. No information regarding seriousness was provided for thrombocytopenia and bacteremia. Treatment with heparin drip was started (ongoing at the time of the reporting) and the patient improved. However, the reporter stated that at the time of the last reporting, all of the patient&#39;s symptoms were ongoing, that all of the patient&#39;s symptoms had worsened. At the time of the last reporting the patient was in the ICU. The patient had not recovered from the all reported events. The reporter did not know if the reported events were related to BNT162b2, however she added that diverticulitis could also cause all the patient&#39;s side effects.  Information on the lot/ batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the thrombosis, sepsis and other reported events due to temporal relationship.

A 36-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number was unclear and reported as either ER8727 or ED8727), via an unspecified route of administration, on 23Mar2021, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included an unspecified inhaler. The patient was healthy. He has asthma, but other than that he has no health issues. He has never been hospitalized. The patient was calling to share his side effects after receiving the vaccine. He took the vaccine because it has been recommended. Most importantly, he took it for his elderly parents. He does not want to hurt them. He wants to help the community. The pharmacist told him he needed to call and report, so he googled Pfizer&#39;s phone number. On Tuesday (23Mar2021), the patient received his first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. At first, he felt nothing. The patient&#39;s head felt a little dizzy (clarifies that it is a heavy feeling) and had a little bit of arm soreness at night (resolved about a day and a half later), but he could not complain. When the patient had the first dose, he experienced headache and sore arm the night on 23Mar2021. After the first dose, his head felt nothing like the day he went to the emergency room. He would say it was maybe 10% of the day he went to the emergency room. The next day (24Mar2021) in the morning, the patient experienced heavy sweating (sweating all over his body), feeling hot, headache, 99.9 degrees (also reported as 9.8) body temperature, and more pain on the arm. On the morning of 24Mar2021, the patient&#39;s head felt heavier. He heard people get chills, he did not get chills. He checked his temperature and it was 99.9 degrees. The patient considers that a pre fever, anything over 100 degrees is a fever to him. Sweating all over his body has gotten better. But it comes back from time to time, along with tingling all over his body (unspecified date). His body tingles, he sweats a little bit and then it goes away. His body tingling and sweating go back to back. Time passed by two days and nothing. On the sixth day (29Mar2021), the patient&#39;s mother had a doctor&#39;s appointment. After the patient got home from taking his mother to the doctor, he started sweating all over his body (started sweating again). His head was heavy (head is a bit heavy again), but not painful. It is heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back. It (head) is only a little bit of pain. He feels like his brain is going to come out of the front of his head. He started throwing up as soon as he got home. He got vertigo. He was running through the house, trying to make it to the bathroom and he fell three times (before he went to the emergency room). His head was spinning, and he could not open his eyes. The patient clarified that he could open up his eyes, but he did not want too. It looked like the building was going up and down. On 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s face was pale yellowish, feel like going to pass out, time to time nausea and vomiting, vertigo, vision was spinning, tingling sensation, no control to his body like he was going to faint, vomited a total of 3 times, felt there is pinching on left side of his chest (the left side of his chest was pinching in the emergency room), and frontal headache. He felt like everything around him was spinning. The patient took meclizine for vertigo and medication for vomiting. The patient&#39;s father has vertigo, so his father gave him some meclizine for his vertigo. The patient also took ondansetron (ZOFRAN). The patient&#39;s family called the hotline and took him to the emergency room (ER). He has not fell again. He vomited three times, and then another in the ambulance, for a total of four times. When he got to the hospital, they started treating him. When he went to the emergency room, he did not open his eyes, and was talking with his eyes closed. All of his symptoms happened at the same time, when he came home from his mother&#39;s doctor appointment. The doctor at the emergency room told him that his electrolytes were out of whack, and that his phosphorus level was too low. They gave him some sodium sulfate right away. The doctor recommended that he stay overnight. The patient did not want to stay overnight because his parents are elderly, and he takes care of them. The doctor told him since he was not willing to stay, to go home and drink a lot of water. Per laboratory works done on 29Mar2021, the patient&#39;s phosphorous and electrolytes were too low, so they gave him saline and sodium phosphate for management. Also, the patient had abdominal and heart X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan done and everything came normal. Also, both X-rays came back clear. The patient had no diarrhea. Heaviness of head started feeling better after his emergency room visit on 29Mar2021. Around 02Apr2021 or 03Apr2021 is whenever it started feeling better. It comes back, and he gets scared. On 30Mar2021, the patient was almost improving and was advised to drink lots of fluids. Every now and then patient was feeling weak and head is hurting, hands are shaking on 30Mar2021. Every single day, he feels dizzy, weak and tingles all over his body. When the patient went to the emergency room, the doctor could not tell him what caused his symptoms. The doctor told him that it could possibly be because of the vaccine. He has never felt like this in his life. He has never fell in his life. He felt hopeless and was crying. He was worried about his elderly parents, and who would take care of them. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is due 13Apr2021. He is debating on whether to take it or not. He cannot afford to take it if it is going to make him feel worse. He has read that the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine makes people feel worse. He is scared. He is asking if he should get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Within one week (unspecified date), he may have lost weight. The patient has to use his inhaler more now as he has a wheezing sound whenever he breathes. He has been using his inhaler more often, whenever he starts wheezing. He always feels like his whole body is tingling. He has no energy. He has only visited this doctor once. His long-term primary care physician is not practicing anymore, he thinks that he may have lost his license. It is hard for him to get an appointment with his primary care doctor since the pandemic. The patient is going to try to see his doctor through tele health. The emergency room doctor recommended that he follow up with a neurologist. The patient was advised to go to a neurologist. The patient reported these symptoms as side effects and asked how long the symptoms last. At the time of reporting, the patient currently still has that nausea and vomiting feeling, but it is better; and he feels heavy (pertaining to vertigo). If he starts to get vertigo again, he knows he will throw up. He can feel whenever the vertigo is coming, he begins to feel like the floor is moving. He can be standing still quietly, and the floor will start moving. The pharmacist told him to call Pfizer and share what happened to him. Since he took the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, he spoke to the pharmacist. He was thinking of taking another company&#39;s vaccine of one shot. But they did not offer it in his area. The patient read that the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine gives him about 50-60% immunity. The patient was asking if he can take the other company&#39;s vaccine. The patient should have taken the other company&#39;s vaccine because it would have been one shot and done. He is nervous about taking the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. He wishes he would have taken the other company&#39;s one shot because then he would not have to worry about having symptoms again. The patient&#39;s father received his second vaccine today. He asked the pharmacist there the same questions. He is still confused about if he is going to take the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. He cannot explain his symptoms. He can handle pain, but he cannot handle, vertigo, throwing up, and feeling numb (as reported; unspecified date). He feels like he had symptoms that people 90 and older should have. He kept falling. The patient further asked if he could take another company&#39;s COVID-19 vaccine as his second dose. Also, if it was okay if he was scheduled to get the second dose 4 weeks after the first dose. Lastly, if the company thinks that he is eligible for the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine despite these symptoms. The patient recovered from &#34;Arm soreness; sore arm&#34; on 25Mar2021; and from &#34;Fell three times&#34; on 29Mar2021. The patient was recovering from &#34;Heavy sweating (sweating all over his body)&#34;, &#34;Head felt heavier; head was heavy in the front side of his head, not in the back&#34;, &#34;Throwing up; vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Nausea&#34;. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

A 36-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 06Apr2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history. No known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6205) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm from 16Mar2021 12:30 at age of 36-year-old for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. No other medications the patient received within 2 weeks of vaccination.

The patient was very sick for 4 days: fevers which came and went, chills, sweats, nausea, loss of appetite, light headedness, lack of energy. As a result of his immune system being weakened, he wound up with Cellulitis which he was still fighting over 3 weeks after the shot. As the patient was normally a healthy male, it was strange that he would wind up with a bacterial infection. The patient also stated that after the second dose he experienced cellulitis in his left leg to thigh area. He went to emergency room for scan and to rule out clot. He thought he was immunocompromised and that was why he got the cellulitis in the leg. Caller wanted to get the compensation information to help with the bills. The events onset date was 06Apr2021 17:00. 2 rounds of antibiotics was received for the events. The events result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included ultrasound with unknown result. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                EE reports he received pfizer vaccine on 1/21/21.  He noted extreme fatigue on 1/22/21 and today 1/23/21 noted an inability to form words and talk while on the phone, dizzy, tongue is half numb, and notes sweating.   EE advised to f/u with ER for assessment.  Consult with Dr.  e-mail was sent alerting her to this reaction.  MAJ follow up on 1/26:  ED record reviewed.  EE had vaccine injected on 1/21 and experienced chills and nausea on 1/22.  On 1/23 he had 1-2 minutes of aphasia and R jaw numbness.  ED evaluation that afternoon revealed a well-appearing adult with normal vital signs and neurologic exam.  Assessment by ED physician was that this was not a stroke or transient ischemic attack but might be a vaccine-related adverse event.  The ee was referred for follow-up with his PCP, Dr. , who can be emailed if further follow up information is needed.  I suspect the ee became dehydrated from vaccine-related nausea and that this was the cause of his transient neurologic symptoms.

A 37 years old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EW0170) injected in left arm on 20Apr2021 14:00 at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was not reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No AE(s) following prior vaccinations. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6207) administered in left arm on 20Mar2021 at 14:30 (24hrs) at age of 37 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization and experienced soreness, arm pain. Caller states patient (her son) had his second Covid vaccination on 20Apr2021, the first one was 20Mar2021. Caller states patient had really a severe reaction from the second Covid Vaccination and that was the reason they are calling to find out. Caller states they reported it to the health department and the location where he had the vaccination but they had no success at all with that. Caller states she will just give an overview and then maybe the patient can chime in if there is any specifics, then maybe he can answer those. Caller states so her understanding was that several hours from having the vaccination, he blacked out, had loss of consciousness on 20Apr2021. Caller states it happened while he was driving on the highway. Caller states it resulted in an accident. Caller states the patient is a self-employed, owner/operator with a transporter that he drives for, he transports automobiles. Caller states what happened was he blacked out while talking on the phone to her other son and that was how they were aware that he had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles, in his occupation. Caller states she called 911. Caller states of course they did not have direct information for 911 in the area that she was calling from, but they were able to locate someone, she did not even know the definite of where he was located and by that time, someone had arrived to the accident scene. Caller states the EMS and police department arrived on the scene and the EMS person said that it was a common thing for someone after having the Covid vaccination to black out and have a loss of consciousness. Caller states they checked the patient out and said that they did not have any reason to take him to the emergency because there were more COVID patients in the hospital there and that was the extent of what she knows. Patient states he blacked out on 20Apr2021 around approximately 20:30, 21:00 (24 hrs). Caller states he took the vaccine at 14:00 (24hrs) on the same day. Caller and patient states that is the first episode he has ever experienced, he has never had any blackouts before, no loss of consciousness. Patient states first off, he started with flu like symptoms, in which he had a headache on 20Apr2021, and was real dizzy on 20Apr2021. Patient states then the blacking out came into place. Patient states it also came with stomach pain before and dizziness on 20Apr2021. Patient states he was feeling very hot on 20Apr2021 then all of a sudden that was pretty much when he lost consciousness when he was operating a vehicle. Caller verifies the accident and the symptoms are from the second vaccine. Patient verifies had the accident around 2030 or 2100 and felt many of those symptoms right before. There was no adverse events (AEs) require a visit to Emergency Room or Physician Office. Reporter for AEs seriousness was unspecified. Caller states he received the first Covid vaccine 20Mar2021 at 14:30(24hrs) and the second Covid vaccine 20Apr2021 at 14:00 (24hrs). Patient verifies that all the symptoms happened at one time. Caller states the patient had no symptoms prior to the vaccination on 20Apr2021 other than the small symptoms, he did have some symptoms from the first vaccination. With the first dose, caller states just soreness, arm pain, not like symptoms from the second vaccine. Caller states with those symptoms and everything, he was driving and he was trying to get to the nearest place where he could pull over and he did not remember how close he was. Patient states he was probably about 40 yards from the location that he needed to be at to pull off the roadway. Patient states the next day or the next evening, for the whole day on 21Apr2021, he felt like he was on something, like someone sedated him and like he was under the influence like as if someone put something in his drink. Patient states he had chills on his body, he was shaking all of a sudden, then a day later, he felt like a whole new person. Patient states it took about two days for it to get out of his system and then he states he has recovered completely from all symptoms by 22Apr2021. Caller asking if there was another number or something that she can contact regarding the results of having the reaction and causes of these symptoms. Caller states when she had a Pfizer vaccination she got some flyers and that was really where she got the information at to call because nobody really knew. Caller states she contacted a lot of numbers prior to getting this number and nobody really knows so she had a flyer on counter measures and the compensation program and she was wondering what the phone number was for that program since an accident occurred that resulted after the vaccine. Outcome of event had an accident while driving fully loaded vehicles was unknown, for rest events was recovered on 22Apr2021. Additional information has been requested.

The burning in his back and skin got worse. He took some paracetamol (TYLENOL) in the morning and the headache started to go down. It came back again worse, so he took paracetamol again. He took two tablets of 500mg paracetamol and he tried to go rest on his break. He took a nap on his break for 15 minutes. When he got up from his nap, he found his achiness was much better. The burning was still there. It was getting less but still there. The headache was less when he woke up from the nap. Headache came back worse and he couldn&#39;t open eyes. He took paracetamol. He took two 500mg tablets again. He didn&#39;t have any energy sitting at his desk doing nothing. He was not able to look at his computer because of the headache. He could not work on 08Jan2021.

The worst occurred the day after when my body could no longer absorb insulin. I increased my basal rate by almost 400% and could not bring my sugars down. Saturday afternoon I began experiencing symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis: stomach pain, vomiting, high ketones and very high  blood sugars. I was able to eventually take in enough water to lower my ketones and sugar and narrowly avoided going to the ER, but high blood sugars and headache have persisted and I am still experiencing these symptoms.

Concern for viral meningitis.  No known sick contacts. Another tonic-clonic seizure occurred around 08:00 on 2/24 AM with vomiting; no overt aspiration though certainly high risk given situation.&#34;

He reported to her that he has &#34;non-stop ringing in the ear&#34;, &#34;wanted to kill himself because of ringing&#34;; couldn&#39;t sleep all night&#34;, had fever. On 2/23, patient&#39;s symptoms got worse. He vomited twice, ringing in the ear continued, had headache, fever, and poor appetite. He also couldn&#39;t sleep. The mother of the patient was advised by the case management team that it&#39;s not uncommon for 2nd shot to cause slight flu-like symptoms for a short while, but she probably needs to call 911 if patient exhibits suicidal tendencies and take him to ED.  She said she already tried over the weekend, called Hatzola. 6 people came to and spoke with patient, including psych. Hatzola left, the patient was not deemed at risk, refused to go anywhere.  She was concerned that he refused to follow up with outside PMD. She was given further instructions to take the patient to the ER and call with any other questions and concerns. She was not heard from since. Attempts were made to contact the patient to follow up, but to no avail. Patient&#39;s phone appears to be off.

                                                Patient received his pfzier covid vaccine.  immediately after he had the vaccine administered, he stated that he started to feel very hot, dizzy, nausea and tingling down his arm that he received the vaccine in.  We immediately got a yoga mat, asked the patient to remove his shirt.  He fell to the ground.  We placed a cold pack under his head around the neck area and cold paper towels on his head.  We took his blood pressure it was 136/88.  He started to mention his chest hurting.  His past medical history includes fainting in the past (due to low blood sugars) and open heart surgery as a child.  He is currently under the care of a cardiologist.  More recently he has had several fainting spells which he believes is due to low blood sugar.  He stated he had eaten a good lunch around 11:30.  It was about 2:30 when this incident occurred.  We offered the patient, a banana, orange, chicken sandwich and water.  He ate the orange.  We called EMS.  When they arrived, they checked his blood sugar which it was 95.  He started to feel better and his wife drove him to the cardiologist.

                                                Hey guys, just a heads up if you know anyone with a CPAP machine who just received a second dose of the vaccine.   I received the shot on Friday.  No reaction all day.  No reaction all day Saturday.  Saturday/Sunday night I started vomiting into my CPAP mask/machine while still asleep. I wouldn?t have woken up unless my wife was there to hear me choking. She cleaned out my mask and had me lay on my side all night while monitoring me.  Scary stuff. Just thought you should make your friends with apnea aware. I still don?t remember the incident at all. I have a mild fever right now, 99.8. I used to tell my wife she saved my life, but now I don&#39;t mean it figuratively. UPDATE: I forgot to mention that I passed out Saturday night.  I was standing in the kitchen and the next thing I knew I was on the ground.

A 38-year-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Lot Number: ER8732, expiration date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the left arm on 30Mar2021 09:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma, thyroid cancer, thyroid removed, rhinitis, allergic to eggs (ongoing). Concomitant medications included calcium since they took out part of parathyroid, levothyroxine for Thyroid removed and calcitriol taken for Better absorption of calcium; and all were ongoing. The patient previously received Tetanus shot on an unspecified date in 2021 (3 weeks to a month prior to getting the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine) with no adverse events. Patient was calling to report adverse side effects that he experienced 2 days ago on 07Apr2021 after having the first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. He said that on 07Apr2021, he was taken ill in an ambulance after passing out and vomiting all over himself and his wife. His wife may have saved his life by keeping him from falling down when he fainted. He was taken in an ambulance to the emergency room after he passed out. He said that it was an unpleasant experience as he had to strip down all of his clothes because they had vomit all over them and change in front of the paramedics before being placed on a stretcher and taken to the emergency room. While in the emergency room, he had a CT scan, bloodwork, and checked body movement by having him follow a finger and various other regular tests. He mentioned that the emergency room physician determined that in likelihood, the reason that he passed out and vomited on himself was a side effect from the Pfizer vaccination. He talked to his physician yesterday. His physician explained to him that because of his health background, what happened following the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, and due to the severity of things, the physician believed that it wouldn&#39;t be a good idea for the caller to get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine given his reaction. The physician stated that it was up to him whether or not he got the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. He had his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He began to feel unwell the following day of the Covid-19 vaccine (31Mar2021), experiencing lethargy, pains in his legs and migraine headache. He reported that he got progressively worse and thought he was having a thyroid issue. He reported that the physicians in the emergency room couldn&#39;t really determine what the cause of the fainting episode could be as all lab work and the CT scan came back normal. The emergency room physician thought that the caller experienced the fainting episode and vomiting due to the Covid-19 vaccine. He experienced a headache and pain in his lymph nodes on the left side. He took Tylenol and was ok. The next day, 31Mar2021, he didn&#39;t feel too well but was ok. He reported that for a few more days following 01Apr2021, he felt not too bad. He didn&#39;t have a temperature or a fever and didn&#39;t think he was suffering from any specific flu like symptoms. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a Medical Facility, outpatient hospital like a walk-in center. The event passing out resulted in Emergency room visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on 07Apr2021 which included, potassium levels: normal, blood pressure: low, experiencing hypotension, thyroid levels were normal, CT scan normal and checked for diabetes: negative. Outcome of the events lethargy, pain in legs and migraine headache was recovering, pain in lymph nodes on left side recovered on 31Mar2021 while unknown for the other events.

                                                About 7 minutes post 1st dose vaccination, patient began to feel lightheaded, clammy, tingling, nauseas, and diaphoretic. He was brought to lay down and vitals were taken. His vitals were stable and upon laying down he began to feel better. He stated he felt tingling in his left arm but it was just for a few minutes. He denies any numbness, rash, CP, SOB, HA, or palpitations. Patient reports he usually has a vaso vagal reaction when he gets his blood drawn. He felt better about ten minutes of laying down and water was provided. He declined transportation to the hospital but agreed to follow up with his PCP or the ER if he has worsening symptoms. Patient was stable upon leaving the vaccination POD.

After both shots, roughly 24-48 hours after I started having similar symptoms. After I would eat, typically lunch/mid-day, I would get a fever. This would involve sweating, upset stomach, sometimes diarrhea, and possibly a headache. I would basically have to lie down or take a short nap. So far, it has been worse after my second shot, but similar. I just thought it was odd that it happened only after I ate, and I haven&#39;t seen much about that side effect.
