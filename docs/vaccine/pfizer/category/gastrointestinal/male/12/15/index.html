At 1:37PM, 6 min post receiving vaccine, patient told mom that he felt lightheaded and was having pain at injection site left arm. Rn assessed immediately and pt reported feeling &#34;sick&#34;.  He drank few sips of water. MD called to bedside. I assessed pt at 1:39PM, pt sitting chair, elevated his legs onto the footrests of wheelchair sitting in front of pt.  &#43;Facial and lip pallor,  and   complaining of nausea followed by 1 episode NBNB emesis consisting of what he ate for lunch 1 hour prior. Pt immediately reported feeling better post emesis. Lips appeared pink. Pt brought to triage area, lay supine on stretcher with legs elevated. Nausea and &#34;lightheaded&#34; sensation resolved prior to lying down. BP improved post emesis from 75/39 to 84/46 at 1:48 PM. Stayed lying down for 5 minutes after which time pt wanted to sit up.  Upon sitting BP and HR increased 96/64 and 69, stable with no nausea or lightheadedness, only remaining  sx &#34;slightly weak&#34;. drank 12 oz apple juice and ate 2 graham crackers without any further emesis or symptoms. Observed for 15 more minutes and was ambulating without return of symptoms, discharged home with mom and brother with instructions to seek medical care if symptoms return.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

                                                During patients 15 minute wait he had a syncopal episode and fell out of his chair. Once I got to the patient he had come to, mom said he was out for about 10-15 seconds max and patient says he did hit his head. Oxygen saturation was 99% on RA, heart rate was 62bpm. BP 110/78. Patient was alert and oriented once I was assessing him. He was able to sit up in the floor about 5 minutes after coming to. He was able to drink water and the PCT had placed cool wet paper towels on his head and neck area. We provided the patient crackers and the management team was available. The patient said he felt like his stomach was upset and did not want the crackers. I suggested he go to the ER and mom said she would drive him and asked if this was caused by the vaccine itself. I explained what could have occurred and educated them on where he hit his head he needs to go to the ER to be assessed. Mom agreed and the manager got a wheelchair from the front of the store and mom drove him to the ER. I called report to ER.

The nausea and extreme fatigue persisted  through Saturday and Sunday.  He was only able to keep minimal liquids and food down.  On Sunday afternoon (around 1pm) we had a low grade fever.  This was the first time he was noted to have a fever.  After consulting with telehealth, it was determined that there may be concern about his appendix.  He was admitted to the ER about 5:30pm on Sunday, and was diagnosed with a perforated appendicitis.  An appendectomy was performed at 1am Monday.

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

A 12-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20May2021 18:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines was administered. The first day, the patient was fine but on day second (22May2021), he was feeling like a choking type of feeling on the base of his chest, like in the lower base of his throat. He said that it was hard for him to swallow. He was breathing normally. Patient&#39;s mother took his oxygen, he had enough oxygen but he says it felt weird and then he was having high blood pressure. Patient&#39;s mother wanted to know if it was normal. The patient experienced high blood pressures and chest discomfort on 22May2021. He has had blood pressures of 170/63. Today, it was 165/95. Events did not require visit to emergency room or physician office. The chest discomfort resolved on 23May2021 however the high blood pressures continue and have remained about the same. Patient&#39;s mother stated she does not want to give her son anything because she was not sure about the vaccine. Outcome of chest discomfort was recovered on 23May2021, of high blood pressure was not recovered, of remaining events was unknown.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

                                                Roughly 7-10 mins after the patient received the vaccine he complains of black out and cant see anything for a couple minutes and feeling weak and nausea.  I measured the patient blood pressure and it seems lower than normal. After the patient rest for a while I reassess the patient blood pressure and he seemed to feel a lot better. I asked the family to stay for additional 15 mins or 20 mins to observe him but they insist on leaving . I instructed the parents to observe him and if he gets worst get medical help. I have a staff member at the facility to call the family after 30 mins later and the parents stated he is moving around and feel a lot better.  The parents also called back a few hours later and stated he is doing good.

Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

                                                His mother was present and told us he had multiple allergies to foods and sulfites, as well as asthma. He used to carry an epi pen but does not currently, also has a history of asthma for which he carries a rescue inhaler. He received the Pfizer vaccine at approximately 9:15am in his left deltoid, and about 2 minutes later Mom notified me and the school nurse that he was starting to get &#34;hives&#34;. I noted a localized, small area of erythema on his left upper arm around the bandaid, approximately silver dollar sized, not raised. School RN removed the bandaid. He did not complain of itching and at that time stated he felt like he was breathing fine. The school RN gave him 50mg of Benadryl PO per the mom&#39;s request at 0920. The patient was in no distress, breathing and speaking normally. At 0922 he stated he felt like his throat and tongue were swelling, so I had him remove his mask, and asked mom if his lips looked swollen to which she responded &#34;yes&#34;. He stated it felt like it was hard to swallow. We placed a pulse ox on the patient and his oxygen saturations were 96-100%, HR 85-90, RR 30. We administered an adult epi pen (0.3mg of epinephrine) into his left lateral thigh at 0923 and had the school office call EMS. The patient remained in no acute distress, and said the swelling in his tongue felt better after the epi, but that his throat still felt swollen. Lungs clear bilaterally, RR remained 24-30, HR 110-115, pulse ox 98-100%, erythema on left upper arm resolved. Fire department arrived at 0935- report given and they checked a pulse ox as well. Patient walked to parking lot to ambulance for transfer to Hospital with mother following behind.

Vomiting was slowing down. There was no fevers as of yet. He was very tired. He started having abdominal pain. We made an appt with the doctor. The next day, he started having fevers to 101.9. I gave  him Motrin and that brought the fever down. He started food and drinks again. The day after all of his symptoms resolved.

                                                Patient was given the shot at 9:36 am and was asked to sit down for 15 minutes to watch how he reacts with the vaccine. He had been very nervous and anxious before getting the shot because he never had a shot before and was afraid of needle. After around 5 minutes, his dad notified me that his son had upset stomach. I asked the patient if he ate or drank anything in the morning. His dad and he confirmed that he didn&#39;t eat or drink anything (because dad thought that he should not eat anything before getting the shot like getting blood drawn). He confirmed that he breathed okay and didn&#39;t have swelling of lip and throat. His father told me that his son did feel a little bit dizzy and sweating. Since the clinic is full of patients and humidy, I told him and his dad to sit in a room in clinic without patients and bring a fan to the room.

                                                Immediately following the vaccine, my son felt totally fine. The pharmacist told us to walk around the store for 15 minutes. 8 minutes after the vaccine, my son said his arm felt tingly. He immediately began sweating profusely and said that he felt dizzy. I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

                                                Fever - up to 102 - lasted until yesterday - it was back down to normal yesterday. He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

                                                While giving a Pfizer Covid vaccine today, a patient appeared to be fine but after a few minutes suddenly passed out and had a short 3-4 second seizure on the ground. He did hit his head and appeared to be hypoxic. We called 911 immediately and informed store management. The paramedics asked him to walk off on his own power, but they did offer to escort the family to Hospital which I believe was accepted. His mother and sister were present too.

He was also short of breath and the pain was worse when lying down. The day after the vaccine, he had fever and emesis, but that resolved within 24 hours. He was taken to  hospital where he was noted to have a troponin of 6.611, and CRP of 1.8. He was transferred to another Hospital for further care. He was treated with IV Toradol. He was seen by cardiology and infectious disease. He showed improvement with nothing more than NSAIDs, and since his MRI was normal, he was not given IVIG.

                                                Patient presents to the ED with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.    From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn&#39;t take anything, he&#39;s active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn&#39;t have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn&#39;t happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn&#39;t had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn&#39;t had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won&#39;t happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

                                                Client received his 1st Pfizer vaccination (Lot# EW0187, EXP 08/31/21) in his left arm at 19:15 from RN.  Client?s parents and sister were with him.  Client?s parents only spoke Spanish and an interpreter was present.  After receiving his shot, client sat in a chair next to his sister while RN administered a shot to her.  Five minutes later client stated he felt nauseous.  RN immediately called out to Vaccine Runner RN and Check-in Nurse who were in the hallway to get an EMT.  Check-in Nurse radioed for an EMT to come to station 3 while Vaccine Runner RN rushed to the EMT room to ensure an EMT got the call.  Check-in Nurse stayed with the client and placed a trash can next to him in case he vomited.  RN stated the client looked pale and clammy.  At 19:26 EMT1 arrived at station 3 and collected the client?s medical history.  Interpreter was also translating the EMT?s questions and statements to the client?s parents.  Client stated he had no known allergies, no underlying conditions, and is not currently taking any medications.  Client also stated he was not experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or having trouble breathing.  EMT2 arrived at station 3 at 19:27 and brought the client a vomit bag.  The client had not vomited, but still felt nauseous.  EMT1 gave the client a bottle of water and juice,  and took client?s vitals at 19:28 (HR:  64, BP:  120/70).  Client stated he felt a lot better.  While walking out of station 5 Lead RN saw individuals grouped together at station 3 with the EMT and arrived at station 3 at 19:28. Lead RN was updated on client?s status.  Lead RN observed that the client was mildly pale and clammy and asked client?s mother if his current coloring was normal for the client.  Interpreter translated to both parents and client?s mother stated that the client did look a little pale.  Client stated he felt better and was just nervous about getting the shot.  At 19:30 Lead RN asked client to try and stand up. Once client was standing, Lead RN asked client if he felt dizzy and client stated no.  Client stated he felt just fine.  Lead RN and EMT?s directed the client to the observation room to sit in a zero-gravity chair for additional monitoring of 30 minutes.  EMTs walked the client and his family to the observation room and sat him in the zero-gravity chair.  Client stated he felt much better and at 19:47 EMT1 took client?s vitals (HR:  66, BP:  100/70, SpO2:  98).  EMT1 stated client?s color was returning.  EMT1 took client?s vitals again at 20:04 (HR:  67, BP:  104/78, SpO2:  99).  Lead RN arrived in observation room at 20:10 with Lead Ancillary to check on client who stood up and stated he felt good.  Lead RN observed that client was no longer pale or clammy.  Lead RN educated parents and client on potential side effects vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN further instructed client and parents to see the client?s HCP or visit urgent care if client started to experience additional common side effects for more than 24-48 hours and to call 911 if the client began to experience trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Lead Ancillary translated all the information to the client in Spanish.  Lead RN observed the client leaving with his family at 20:15. Client left walking with a steady gate.

                                                The morning after the second dose of the vaccine he woke up and felt hot and my head hurt. He had woken up feeling similar a few times during the night. When he got up he felt really queasy and threw up.  He felt really warm and continued to throw up. With Tylenol the fever was 104 degrees and it continued for several hours even after two doses of Tylenol. I was told to give Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The fever returned to 102 degrees and four later the fever broke. It was almost 10 hours where he was throwing up and the fever fluctuated between 102-104. It is very unusual for him to have any fever.  We continued the Benadryl and Ibuprofen the following day because he still had a low grade fever and some dizziness followed by diarrhea. The dizziness and Diarrhea occurred again the next day three after the vaccine.  It has been five days and he feels better but his stomach is still a little sensitive.  It is possible that he had Covid-19 last year.

                                                Patient stated his throat was tightening up and that he was having difficulty breathing shortly after (~20 min) receiving the vaccine. Parent stated that the patient has a known allergy to peanuts but was assured that the covid19 vaccine from Pfizer does not contain any peanuts. I checked to make sure the patient didn&#39;t have any hives or swelling in any other areas of body and face. Patient was still alert and able to speak but did display some labored breathing. I had an EpiPen ready to administer but first gave him 50 mg of diphenhydramine liquid which he showed difficulty ingesting and continued to monitor while EMS was on their way. When EMS arrived they checked the patient&#39;s O2 and it was at normal levels. EMS determined patient was okay and gave the parent the option of taking the patient home or she could have him taken to the ER in an ambulance. Parent decided to take patient home.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.
