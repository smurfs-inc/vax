At 1:37PM, 6 min post receiving vaccine, patient told mom that he felt lightheaded and was having pain at injection site left arm. Rn assessed immediately and pt reported feeling &#34;sick&#34;.  He drank few sips of water. MD called to bedside. I assessed pt at 1:39PM, pt sitting chair, elevated his legs onto the footrests of wheelchair sitting in front of pt.  &#43;Facial and lip pallor,  and   complaining of nausea followed by 1 episode NBNB emesis consisting of what he ate for lunch 1 hour prior. Pt immediately reported feeling better post emesis. Lips appeared pink. Pt brought to triage area, lay supine on stretcher with legs elevated. Nausea and &#34;lightheaded&#34; sensation resolved prior to lying down. BP improved post emesis from 75/39 to 84/46 at 1:48 PM. Stayed lying down for 5 minutes after which time pt wanted to sit up.  Upon sitting BP and HR increased 96/64 and 69, stable with no nausea or lightheadedness, only remaining  sx &#34;slightly weak&#34;. drank 12 oz apple juice and ate 2 graham crackers without any further emesis or symptoms. Observed for 15 more minutes and was ambulating without return of symptoms, discharged home with mom and brother with instructions to seek medical care if symptoms return.

                                                12 yo male presenting with bilateral lower extremity paresthesias and confusion.  Admitted to the hospital.  Pending discharge to rehab facility.  ED Note 5/19/21 Patient is a 12-year-old male with hypogammaglobulinemia, asthma, IBS who presents with weakness in his lower extremities.   6 days ago, patient had seafood and later that night vomited once, nonbloody, nonbilious. 4 days ago, he received the first dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV2 vaccination. That day, he also felt some burning over the anterior parts of his bilateral ankles. Over the past 3 days, he has been sleeping a lot and had a headache. He has not had a fever or other muscle aches, no subsequent N/V, abdominal pain. Last night, he reported ankle pain to his mom. Today at school, he was playing kickball when he had the sensation that his ankles were not working/gave out and he fell to the ground. He had difficulty getting up and required a wheelchair. He did not lose consciousness, denied CP, palpitations, SOB, headache, vision change during or before that episode. He was not incontinent of urine/stool and had no abnormal movements noted at the time. Since then he has noted twitching in his thighs, calves and toes. He reports weakness throughout both lower extremities and has difficulty with intentional movements at the toes/ankles/knees, weakness in hips. He reports a burning sensation over the anterior ankles/dorsum of foot b/l. Denies fevers, chills, cough, SOB, CP, palpitations, abdominal pain, N/V/C. He endorses diarrhea 3x daily which is his baseline. He has panic attacks 3x daily w palpitations/SOB that self resolve. He has been on keflex for an ingrown toe nail for the last week.  MRI performed with normal brain and spine.  However, on repeat exam patient has diminished sensation in the bilateral feet and diminished ability to dorsiflex or plantarflex both ankles with very limited toe range of motion.  Still with preserved reflexes in the patella and Achilles.  Discussed at length with neurology and the family.  Differential diagnosis at this point of functional neurological disorder versus Guillaine Barré syndrome.   Neurology note 5/21/21 Patient is a 12yo M with hypogammaglobinemia, IBS, and poorly controlled anxiety, presenting with 4 days of lower extremity paresthesias and 1 day of hyperacute onset of lower extremity weakness and perhaps some mild confusion.   History notable for covid vaccine three days prior to presentation and anixety surrounding covid and return to school. His general examination is notable for anxious affect with difficult to localize neurologic exam. Exam shows possible bilateral lower extremity weakness of TA and hamstring&gt;quad/IP that is very challenging to grade due to poor effort and giveway, and decreased sensation in a bilateral stocking/glove distribution to all sensory modalities.  MRI w/wo contrast brain and spinal cord normal on admission. LP perfromed in ED also normal. Given negative workup and history of anxiety with recent psychosocial stressors, most likely sudden onset weakness is secondary to a functional neurologic disorder.  Plan for discharge to rehab pending PT evaluation.

He subsequently developed fever, diarrhea, and vomiting.  The day prior to admission, he developed a diffuse popular rash.  He was seen in clinic on 5/20 and lab work was obtained, which was consistent with MIS-C findings (elevated troponin, elevated fibrinogen, elevated CRP, hyponatremia, relatively low absolute lymphocyte count).

                                                During patients 15 minute wait he had a syncopal episode and fell out of his chair. Once I got to the patient he had come to, mom said he was out for about 10-15 seconds max and patient says he did hit his head. Oxygen saturation was 99% on RA, heart rate was 62bpm. BP 110/78. Patient was alert and oriented once I was assessing him. He was able to sit up in the floor about 5 minutes after coming to. He was able to drink water and the PCT had placed cool wet paper towels on his head and neck area. We provided the patient crackers and the management team was available. The patient said he felt like his stomach was upset and did not want the crackers. I suggested he go to the ER and mom said she would drive him and asked if this was caused by the vaccine itself. I explained what could have occurred and educated them on where he hit his head he needs to go to the ER to be assessed. Mom agreed and the manager got a wheelchair from the front of the store and mom drove him to the ER. I called report to ER.

                                                Approximately 26 hours after receiving injection (around 6:30 pm on a Friday), he began to vomit and have extreme fatigue.  The nausea and extreme fatigue persisted  through Saturday and Sunday.  He was only able to keep minimal liquids and food down.  On Sunday afternoon (around 1pm) we had a low grade fever.  This was the first time he was noted to have a fever.  After consulting with telehealth, it was determined that there may be concern about his appendix.  He was admitted to the ER about 5:30pm on Sunday, and was diagnosed with a perforated appendicitis.  An appendectomy was performed at 1am Monday.

From EHR note: Patient is an otherwise healthy 12yM with recent Lyme disease (erythema migrans) transferred to hospital for hyponatremia, encephalitis, myocarditis. Initially intubated due to aspiration risk, now s/p extubation and stable on RA. Broad workup so far including consultations from neurology, cardiology, immunology, and infectious disease with unclear etiology, s/p MRI and LP with c/f covid-vaccine related myocarditis/encephalitis vs lyme carditis/meningoencephalitis vs less likely MISC vs other. Infectious testing so far negative, patient otherwise has returned to baseline behavior without any current symptoms. He is transferred to general for further workup and evaluation and close monitoring. Diagnosed with Lyme 19 days prior to admission,  treated with amoxicillin; p/w headache, fever and vomiting so concern for encephalitis as above vs inflammatory process post-COVID or vaccine. Less likely meningitis given reassuring initial CSF studies. Negative COVID antibody.  Resolving hyponatremia, thought to be likely SIADH. Given presentation and maternal history of albinism with immunodeficiency, broad workup sent. Also with c/f possible inflammatory response/MISC-C vs vaccine myocarditis.

A 12-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 20May2021 18:15 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0168) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. No additional vaccines was administered. The first day, the patient was fine but on day second (22May2021), he was feeling like a choking type of feeling on the base of his chest, like in the lower base of his throat. He said that it was hard for him to swallow. He was breathing normally. Patient&#39;s mother took his oxygen, he had enough oxygen but he says it felt weird and then he was having high blood pressure. Patient&#39;s mother wanted to know if it was normal. The patient experienced high blood pressures and chest discomfort on 22May2021. He has had blood pressures of 170/63. Today, it was 165/95. Events did not require visit to emergency room or physician office. The chest discomfort resolved on 23May2021 however the high blood pressures continue and have remained about the same. Patient&#39;s mother stated she does not want to give her son anything because she was not sure about the vaccine. Outcome of chest discomfort was recovered on 23May2021, of high blood pressure was not recovered, of remaining events was unknown.

A 12-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: unknown and Expire Date: unknown) on 22May2021 via unspecified route of administration as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. As medical history it was reported that, he had allergies and allergic to a lot of things, mold, feather dust and everything and dyspepsia. He had been taking Claritin for allergies (but not when he got the vaccine). She stated her son did not have any allergies to medications. Concomitant mediations were not reported. On 26May2021, 4 days after that he was complaining of chest pain. Caller wants to know if her son should get the 2nd dose of the vaccine. Caller stated, &#34;He had other symptoms. On Tuesday the chest pain went away then complained again on Thursday. His doctor gave him an EKG and his heart rate was fine. Caller did not take him to the ER at the time because did not want a medical bill. His blood sugar spiked up. He had sweating, vomiting, diarrhea. He said he had &#34;sharp pain in my chest and never felt that before&#34; His blood sugar spiked up. He was dehydrated. He had ketones from it. Caller gave him extra insulin. He had chest pain from the vaccine. It was on Tuesday and happened again on Thursday but had not come back since then. It subsided. EKG was ok.&#34; No one was informed (doctors). I took him to the regular doctor. She did not know. She was not aware of the symptoms. They are not specialized in the medications they are giving. It was hard to give them any kind of referral. Both of us had vomiting, headaches and chills. He had never had chest pains from any vaccines. He had fatigue, these are symptoms form the covid shot. It was 4 days and then 6 days after the vaccine. A fast heartbeat. HCP are not going to help. If they are dosing the covid shots but they are not given the vaccines they did not want to do anything. There was no accountability. Caller having a hard time. No one can give me an answer, no one. Not from the experts, no one was telling me. The vaccine administration should have been through the doctors, they will not take your data without understanding the vaccines. All the kids 12 and up and all male and like my son and probably a lot more but they are not saying it. Caller scared. My son did not have a heart defect. Caller did not know. Heart inflammation; they need to know if it was safe or not. It was scary to know no one knows what was going on or not. Caller asked about myocarditis. The patient had heart burn before but said the chest pain was not that. With the symptoms the caller saw online, she thinks the patient had pericarditis. The patient&#39;s next dose was on 12Jun2021.The caller was reading online that people reported chest pain and ended up in the emergency room and the caller did not want that. All the events occurred on an unspecified date in May2021. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood glucose increased: spiked up on May2021, electrocardiogram: fine on 25May2021 EKG and his heart rate was fine, heart rate increased: fast on 25May2021. The outcome of event chest pain was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of dehydrated. The outcome of blood sugar spiked up, sweating, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, felt sick, extreme fatigue, and slept on and off for about 4 days, dehydration, fast heartbeat and pericarditis was unknown.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

They performed blood tests which showed some inflammation (but obviously don?t know where) so they performed an Abdominal US which was normal. Patient continued to have severe abdominal pain and they proceeded with a CT scan with and without contrast, which was also normal. They couldn?t say if it was a reaction from the vaccine but possibly, since everything was WNL.

                                                Had 2nd Pfizer vaccine at 5:15pm Thursday June 3. Felt fine that evening, just complained arm was starting to hurt when he went to bed around 11pm. Threw up twice on Friday June 4 at 9:30am &amp; 1:30 pm. Very uncomfortable, bad headache, no energy. Mostly slept from 6pm Friday June 4 to 5am Saturday June 5. Immediately threw up when he woke up Friday. Threw up again about 30 min. later and 4 more times during the day. Still having bad head pain. Started to become confused and say things that didn&#39;t make sense. Went to ER around 4:30pm Saturday June 5. Blood work showed his sodium level was dangerously low. He was immediately given sodium and transported to Hospital ICU. Had brain MRI, lumbar puncture and lots of blood work done. Brain MRI showed signs of encephalitis. Also had myocarditis. Was in hospital until Thur. June 10. Encephalitis and myocarditis seemed to resolve quickly and he was just treated with rest and fluids along with antibiotics in case there was any viral/infectious cause of symptoms. All such tests have been negative to date

                                                After receiving the second dose on 6/15, my son woke up at 3:30am on 6/16 with a nose bleed that lasted as a steady light stream for about 5 minutes.  He also had a slight fever of 100.  By 7:30am on 6/16 his fever was slowly increasing and the nausea began.  He did not throw up but it is now 10:45am on 6/16 and his fever is 102.6 and he is still nauseous.  I&#39;m not too worried since these are all common symptoms but I felt like I should should report them since he is 12 years old.

A 12-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/Lot number and expiration date: not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration in Arm Left on 19May2021 (at the age of 12-years-old) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included covid-19 on an unknown date in Oct 2020, allergy to animal (cats) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) and AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none. Patient&#39;s mother mentioned that day after his shot, he experienced fever and diarrhea (on 20May2021) which lasted for 7 days. Caller states the fever was more like 8 days and the diarrhea was at least 8 days, she would have to ask him when it completely went away. Caller states her son lost 5 pounds (on 20May2021) when he got sick on an unspecified date, he was 90 pounds currently, he was 95 when he got the vaccine. She states he kept losing weight over the week. Caller states his stool was green and he was pooping everything out, it was gross on an unspecified date.  On the 2nd day, he experienced vomiting (on 21May2021). He was also tired for a long time on an unspecified date. Caller states her son had been staying at his dad&#39;s house when he was sick. She states she would&#39;ve taken him to be seen earlier because after 5 days of fever, he needed an IGG drip in case it was his heart or similar to Kawasaki. She requested him to get an IgG Drip because, according to her, any child who has a fever for 7 days might have the virus that causes Kawasaki disease. This is based on her experience with her daughter who has Kawasaki disease. The son was not given the IgG drip because the doctors were not sure. They also tested his stool, but he did not have anything wrong. She mentioned that her son had COVID in October, the one that got sick for a week, then goes away, and comes back again. He was sick for a while with all the symptoms, and it was proven that he had it. Caller states when he got sick, they wanted to rule other things out, so they tested his feces for a bunch of things, but he was negative for everything. As of calling, the son had recovered but she was requesting for him to have an ultrasound of the heart. She was asking if he should get the 2nd dose. The events resulted in physician office visit. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included culture stool negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event fever, lost weight was recovered on 28May2021; vomiting recovered on 21May2021; diarrhea, fatigue recovered on an unspecified date; and the outcome was unknown for faeces discoloured and illness.

Pulse and blood oxygen were checked each time temp was taken (approx 3 times between 24 and 36 hours after shot) and were within normal ranges each time; although pulse was on the higher end of the normal range for a 12 year old boy.  Quick recover starting 36 hours after shot, when temp reduced to approx. 100.  Appetite returned at this time.  Fever was gone by 48 hours after shot and all other side effect seemed to have subsided by this point.  No mediation was taken by the vaccine recipient.  Vaccine recipient was offered usual foods and he consumed milk and water in smaller amounts than usual but also more frequently than usual to stay hydrated.

He was able to sleep but had chest pain the following morning that improved after he vomited. The chest pain is midsternal and feels pressure-like. It lasted a few hours. He swam on 7/12 without problems (at a swim club) for an hour. He had his second dose of COVID-19 vaccine on Saturday 7/10/21. There has not been any fevers. Elevated troponin and CRP with recent COVID-19 vaccine, suspicious for post-vaccine myocarditis. He is hemodynamically stable with normal vitals and no evidence of ventricular ectopy or depressed left ventricular function. His troponin peaked at 11.05 and trended down, but his most recent value is slightly up at 8.2 from 7.6. Recommended continuing to trend the troponins for now (if they show a downward trend then twice daily is adequate, unless he develops chest pain).

This consumer reported for a 12-year-old male patient (grandson).   A 12-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 07Jul2021 11:30 (At the age of 12 year old) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Caller called on behalf of his grandson (12-year-old) who received the first dose of the Pfizer Biontech COVID-19 vaccine and on the same day he got the shot, he experienced headache, neck ache, fever, and throwing up on 07Jul2021. Stated that the headache gets better and comes better. Stated that it was tolerable and comes back. Stated that the fever comes and goes. Started throwing up 2-3 days ago. She wanted to know if those side effects were related to the COVID19 vaccine and if she needed to go to the doctor and if he could get the second dose. Caller also stated that the side effects outweigh the COVID shot, I do not want my grandchild to suffer like that. Vaccines were supposed to make you feel better, not sick. Caller asked if the vaccine was tested on children and if they had side effects. Wanted to know if she needed to go the doctor because he cannot live throwing up all the time. Stated that he had never been sick before. Stated that he was only 12 years old. Does not think that vaccine was adequate for children. Therapeutic measures included Ibuprofen for his headache and fever. Stated that he had cold compresses for the neckache. Stated that he had ginger ale and Pepto Bismol for throwing up. Outcome of the event headache and throwing up was reported as not recovered at this time of the time. Outcome of the event neck ache was reported as recovered on 11Jul2021. Outcome of the event fever was reported as recovering and outcome of the event potential not to get the second shot was reported as Unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I administered the Pfizer COVID vaccine to the patient at about 2pm. I completed the vaccine, put the used syringe into the sharps container, grabbed the bandage, and turned back toward the patient. As I did this, he started slumping over in the chair, and his eyes rolled back into his head. I immediately put my arms around him so he wouldn&#39;t fall out of the chair. The patient&#39;s father was in the room as well and knelt down in from of him. The patient&#39;s body spasmed for a few seconds, then he came to but was breathing heavily and starting to sweat. I called to technician in the pharmacy and asked him to call 911 at 2:03pm.  I brought the patient a cool cloth and asked a technician to bring some water. The patient&#39;s breathing started to slow, but he was nauseous and dizzy. He dry-heaved once, and I put the garbage can in front of him. He slumped over the garbage can for a few minutes. Then he asked to lie on the floor. He seemed to do better lying on the floor. When the EMTs arrived, they attempted to have him sit in the chair again, but his dizziness returned, and he complained of being cold. The EMTs moved the patient to the gurney and transported him to the Hospital for further medical attention.

                                                Roughly 7-10 mins after the patient received the vaccine he complains of black out and cant see anything for a couple minutes and feeling weak and nausea.  I measured the patient blood pressure and it seems lower than normal. After the patient rest for a while I reassess the patient blood pressure and he seemed to feel a lot better. I asked the family to stay for additional 15 mins or 20 mins to observe him but they insist on leaving . I instructed the parents to observe him and if he gets worst get medical help. I have a staff member at the facility to call the family after 30 mins later and the parents stated he is moving around and feel a lot better.  The parents also called back a few hours later and stated he is doing good.

                                                Fatigue, pain around injection side on the day after vaccine during the day. Nothing concerning but right before he went to bed he didn&#39;t feel good. My son thought he had to vomit but couldn&#39;t. He said his HEARTBEAT WAS SO MUCH FASTER than normal. I got so concerned that I slept next to him which I never did before. He fell asleep after 1 h and woke up the next morning and felt fine. I did not go to the doctor because he was feeling well the next day.

                                                His mother was present and told us he had multiple allergies to foods and sulfites, as well as asthma. He used to carry an epi pen but does not currently, also has a history of asthma for which he carries a rescue inhaler. He received the Pfizer vaccine at approximately 9:15am in his left deltoid, and about 2 minutes later Mom notified me and the school nurse that he was starting to get &#34;hives&#34;. I noted a localized, small area of erythema on his left upper arm around the bandaid, approximately silver dollar sized, not raised. School RN removed the bandaid. He did not complain of itching and at that time stated he felt like he was breathing fine. The school RN gave him 50mg of Benadryl PO per the mom&#39;s request at 0920. The patient was in no distress, breathing and speaking normally. At 0922 he stated he felt like his throat and tongue were swelling, so I had him remove his mask, and asked mom if his lips looked swollen to which she responded &#34;yes&#34;. He stated it felt like it was hard to swallow. We placed a pulse ox on the patient and his oxygen saturations were 96-100%, HR 85-90, RR 30. We administered an adult epi pen (0.3mg of epinephrine) into his left lateral thigh at 0923 and had the school office call EMS. The patient remained in no acute distress, and said the swelling in his tongue felt better after the epi, but that his throat still felt swollen. Lungs clear bilaterally, RR remained 24-30, HR 110-115, pulse ox 98-100%, erythema on left upper arm resolved. Fire department arrived at 0935- report given and they checked a pulse ox as well. Patient walked to parking lot to ambulance for transfer to Hospital with mother following behind.

                                                Patient was given the shot at 9:36 am and was asked to sit down for 15 minutes to watch how he reacts with the vaccine. He had been very nervous and anxious before getting the shot because he never had a shot before and was afraid of needle. After around 5 minutes, his dad notified me that his son had upset stomach. I asked the patient if he ate or drank anything in the morning. His dad and he confirmed that he didn&#39;t eat or drink anything (because dad thought that he should not eat anything before getting the shot like getting blood drawn). He confirmed that he breathed okay and didn&#39;t have swelling of lip and throat. His father told me that his son did feel a little bit dizzy and sweating. Since the clinic is full of patients and humidy, I told him and his dad to sit in a room in clinic without patients and bring a fan to the room. After 15 minutes (around 9:51am), after drinking water and eating a banana, all the side effects were gone. He felt better, and he could watch videos/games and have full focus. At 10:24 am (which was more than 30 min resting in clinic), his father and he confirmed that he was feeling better and didn&#39;t have any side effects and decided to leave the clinic and go home.

I made him sit down and he then said that he felt nauseous. Within 5 minutes of the onset of symptoms, he vomited. He was pale and his forehead was cold/clammy. The pharmacist said it was anxiety and nothing to be concerned about. However, my son said that he did not feel worried, anxious, etc. prior to or immediately following the vaccine.

                                                Fever - up to 102 - lasted until yesterday - it was back down to normal yesterday. He has had a sore arm - at injection site; the arm also was hard - a lump that was a little bit  palpable  - which is gone now; - body aches - gone now, chills, difficulty swallowing. He didn&#39;t have trouble breathing, but he felt his throat tighten when he swallowed (still has this); upper right abdominal pain - that is the real bad symptom still. His eyes hurt when he moved them around. Fatigue. He&#39;s been glued to the couch since Friday. I had given Advil and Tylenol. After the prolonged fever, I eventually called into the doctor&#39;s office. The pediatrician said it was common and said to wait it out but seek treatment if it got worse. He is able to eat but is awful nauseous. He is eating what sounds good. The pain stays the same when he eats.

He did hit his head and appeared to be hypoxic. We called 911 immediately and informed store management. The paramedics asked him to walk off on his own power, but they did offer to escort the family to Hospital which I believe was accepted. His mother and sister were present too.

He was also short of breath and the pain was worse when lying down. The day after the vaccine, he had fever and emesis, but that resolved within 24 hours. He was taken to  hospital where he was noted to have a troponin of 6.611, and CRP of 1.8. He was transferred to another Hospital for further care. He was treated with IV Toradol. He was seen by cardiology and infectious disease. He showed improvement with nothing more than NSAIDs, and since his MRI was normal, he was not given IVIG.

                                                Patient presents to the ED with myocarditis s/p dose #2 of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.    From note: Patient is 13 yo M who was in his usual state of health prior to getting his Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine #2 on Saturday morning (6/5). Saturday night he began to feel fatigued with fevers as high as 102.8 F. These symptoms continued through the night and into Sunday morning when he had episodes of NBNB emesis. Sunday night he was actually feeling somewhat better and was able to sleep through the night. He stayed home from school on Monday due to fatigue. At 3 am this morning (6/8), he woke up with aching parasternal non-radiating chest pain that he describes as an 8/10 and worse while lying down. Denies SOB and heart palpitations. His parents took him to a hospital where he was found to have an elevated troponin (reported 5.84 - unknown scale) and Hct 28.8. There was also question of an abnormal EKG (?p wave inversion). He got a bedside echo which showed no pericardial effusion. Additional labs included: WBC nml, plt nml, MBCK 16.   In the ED, his vital signs have been stable. EKG was normal sinus. Trop elevated to 0.43 and echo was normal. Reassuringly his echo was normal, he has had no arrhythmias (after nearly 24hrs of continuous monitoring), his chest pain has largely resolved and his troponin has remained stable.

A 13-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EW0164, expiration date: 31Aug2021), at the age of 13 years old, in left arm on 14May2021 16:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient was a normal 13 years old, he doesn&#39;t take anything, he&#39;s active. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The vaccines administered on same date with BNT162B2 was none. The previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine was none. The patient previously received the flu shot every year and experienced no adverse event. On 16May2021, about 48 hours after the vaccination, the patient started having stomach pain in the middle of the night. It began 16May2021 in the evening and into 17May2021, the patient was having stomach pain and not feeling well. Reporter stated the patient woke her up. Reporter stated they thought it was some food he ate. Reporter stated they tested his covid antibodies and they also personally at home on 17May2021 night, they tested him with a home kit for covid just to double check because nobody really brought it up and it was negative also. Reporter confirmed the home covid test was done on 17May2021. Reporter stated there was no known exposure, they just did it to make sure he didn&#39;t have covid. The patient was taken to the emergency room on 18May2021. Reporter stated they were waiting because patient felt good during the day and they thought nothing was wrong, but then the extreme stomach pain started again and so on 18May2021, she took him to the local emergency room. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t do much other than push on his stomach, she was worried about appendicitis. Reporter stated they didn&#39;t worry too much, but she thought maybe it was his appendix. The doctor examined him and said he had a stomach issue and released him with medicine and that was the 18May2021. On 19May2021 and 20May2021, the patient would get intermittent stomach pain, again thinking it was a stomach bug or something. On 20May2021, the patient experienced petechial rash on his legs. Reporter called the pediatrician and again the patient was having intermittent stomach pain and kept having it intermittently. The patient would feel fine then feel sick again then on the 22May2021, the patient had more bad stomach pain and some vomiting so he wound up back in the emergency department, it was a different one than the first on 22May2021. The patient did a lot of blood work, his labs came back good, but he did not do a CAT scan, but reporter tried to do everything else, tested patient for covid, antibodies and everything and they sent him home again on the 22May2021. The patient had intermittent pain again throughout 23May2021 then on 24May2021, he went to visit the pediatrician just for a visit and they were thinking its Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) which is an autoimmune response and they still didn&#39;t have a diagnosis for his stomach. Reporter stated patient was perfectly fine at the pediatrician, then when they got home, he started having lower left abdominal pain and he doubled over in pain and started vomiting. The patient vomited about three times in total, it wasn&#39;t like excessive vomiting. Reporter stated the pain would bring it on, he does have a rash, which is still getting a little bit worse. Reporter stated they took him back to the emergency room, they did a CAT scan and that showed he had inflammation in his intestines and his stomach so they kept him in the hospital. The patient was admitted on 24May2021 when he visited the emergency room for the third time. Reporter stated because patient was in pain, they admitted him to watch him. Reporter stated they were worried about the patient having intussusception with the bowel, where his bowel can go inside each other and can create a blockage, so they wanted to admit him to make sure that didn&#39;t happen. Reporter stated the worst of the stomach pain was on 25May2021, which would have been at 19:00. The patient had not had an episode since then, he hadn&#39;t had an attack like that since. The whole week before from 17May2021, or the 16May2021 when it started through 25May2021, it was very intermittent of a lot of pain. So far, knock on wood, the patient hadn&#39;t had it since 25May2021 at 19:00 and hopefully tonight it won&#39;t happen. Reporter stated it will be about 48 hours of not having the bad pain. Reporter stated he still has some pain, but not like where she had to rush him to the emergency room. The patient&#39;s vomiting ended on 24May2021 or 25May2021. He had recovered completely from vomiting so far. The patient was released on 26May2021 with a diagnosis of HSP, which was an auto immune response, and he&#39;d never had this happen before. Reporter stated if she googled HSP, it said it can still get worse, but it was not the worst case of HSP. Reporter stated the patient has never had anything like this before, he was perfectly fine, they made it through covid and didn&#39;t get covid and he is a healthy kid so she thought Pfizer should know. The outcome of the events HSP, stomach pain, petechial rash was not recovered. The outcome of vomiting was recovered on 24May2021 or 25May2021. The outcome of the events inflammation in intestines and stomach, didn&#39;t feel well/feel sick, intermittent pain and lower left abdominal pain was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                He woke up with chest pain in the upper right quadrant at midnight and then it intensified when he was breathing deep breaths. They woke him up when he was sleeping and did not go away. Then, it continued through the next day and we asked our doctor if we needed to keep an eye on him because of all the reporting and stuff about the heart problems. They did a triage consult visit to see if it could be an adverse event from the vaccine. The course of action was to take 2 ibuprofen every 4 hours and use ice and heat to see if the pain improved to rule out musculoskeletal situations because that was what they thought it was. We did that for 2 days and then the pain moved to his back upper right quadrant and we noticed a rash all over his abdomen and we were not sure where he got that. Based on the fact that the pain moved the doctor was more confident that it was not an adverse event.

                                                Patient received his second dose of covid vaccine on 07/12/21.  He seemed fine and left our immunization area.  Approximately 5 minutes later, his brother came back to the pharmacy to inform us that the patient was sitting down near the restrooms and not feeling well.   I, along with another pharmacist, went to assess him.  He said he was lightheaded and was feeling nauseous.  We sat with him for approximately 10 minutes and checked his blood pressure twice.  His blood pressure was high the first time we took it, but it returned to normal after a few minutes when we took it the second time.   We subsequently found out from his mother that he fell/fainted in the restroom due to his dizziness.  He was unhurt from the fall.  After approximately 10 minutes he said he was feeling fine and was able to continue shopping with his mother.

                                                Patient is a 14 YO male with no previous medical history that received the Pfizer vaccine administered into his left Deltoid at 1406. He was sent to the observation area where the nurse noted him looking pale at 1410. His mother was present during this whole event. He was taken over to the medical tent for privacy and further evaluation. He was complaining of being light headed. He was given apple juice and crackers as he had stated that he had not eaten or drank anything all day.    At 1430 his VS read BP 132/80, HR 145, O2 99%. At this time he was lying down and feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. Lung sounds clear. Nausea but not needing to throw up he was covered up to try and keep him warm. At 1440 his blood pressure was 130/82, HR 130, 02 98% At this time he was lying flat with feet elevated, shaking, pale, and cold. His lung sounds clear.  Nausea, but not needing to throw up.  At 1450 BP 138/74, HR 120-135, 02 98%. Symptoms had not changed at this point except he mentioned his ears felt cold, although they were warm to touch.  He was laid on his left side at this point to try and lower his HR, which did come down to 115-125 when on his L side. We did not take a BP at this point as we wanted him to be on his back when taking them.  At 1515 he was laid back on his back to see how his HR would do and how his BP was. BP 138/60, HR 135, 02 98%. Again symptoms were the same except he was complaining of colors being more ?dull?, and his teeth being numb. At this point his pupils were noted to be &#43;8, equal and reactive.  1521 VS read 138/50, HR 135, 02 98%. Vision still dull and pupils unchanged from 1515. He was laid on his R side to see if this would lower his HR. It was brought down to 120-130 on his R side. We gave him a cookie to snack on to see if that would help with any of the paleness, shakiness, and light headiness. He was able to take a few small bites.  Hands pale and washed, with &#43;1 bilateral radial pulses.  1529 he was sat up slowly to try to get him to hydrate, as it was apparent he needed fluids onboard. His BP read 142/80, HR 124, 02 98%. He was still complaining of lightheadedness. After sitting up and drinking half a bottle of water and some cookie, he stated that colors were becoming more vibrant. He noticed my eyes were very blue, which previously he had stated they were grey. He stated his lightheadedness had improved and that he was feeling better. We had him sit up for a while and his color started to come back, although his L arm was still pale, of note this was the Vaccinated arm.  At 1546 his VS read 150/82, HR 117, O2 99% while sitting. His only complaint was feeling like the air he was breathing ?was cold?.    At 1607 he was stood up and when doing so his HR went to 140. After standing for about 4 minutes his BP read 120/82, HR 114, O2 98%. His pupils &#43;6 , equal, round, and reactive.  He was feeling way better and his color in his L hand was back equal to his right. He was slowly walked around a chair just to see how he would do with activity. His HR was anywhere from 94-120 when walking around the chair, he complained of no dizziness, or other symptoms.  At this point he had finished 2 apple juices, crackers, a cookie, and a bottle of water for a total of 1.5 L of fluid.  He was sat back down in the chair to rest and see how things went for a while. His HR was anywhere from 109-120 when in the chair, although he did appear very anxious through this whole process. When he was given a task it appeared that his HR was a few points lower.   His final HR was 109, BP 130/82, O2 98%.  Of note he did complain of his feet and fingers feeling tingly a few times during this process. Sometimes his feet would be tingly when elevated and then when the garbage can holding them up was readjusted it resolved. These were intermittent complaints.  At this point it is 1630. He has responded to fluids and is stable to go home with his mom. It was recommended for him to increase his fluids tonight, and to eat something. He was sent with a bottle of water. It was also recommended to get a pulse ox machine from a pharmacy so that his HR could be monitored and if it does not come down under 100 by tomorrow to make an appointment with his MD to follow up.  If any of these symptoms were to come back or if his mom had any concern at all it was recommended to take him to the ED for observation. It was also recommended to follow up with his primary even though he left stable.  Throughout this process, I considered administering Epinephrine. The problem was his BP was not low and we could not get his HR to come down. I did not want to increase his HR any more than it already was unless I was absolutely necessary. Given that he responded to fluids, it was decided not to administer it.   Given that it took him 2.5 hours to recover from this vaccine, I strongly recommend that he does not get his second dose. I consider this to be an adverse reaction, and his mom was in agreement.

He woke up few minutes prior to the event and this event started after he passed urine. As soon as he finished Urination, he felt nauseated, dizzy and then lost consciousness thereafter. He fell backwards as a result and hurt his back as well as back side of the head. During his unconsciousness  his body was completely stiff and his eyes were rolled back. For few seconds then he became completely still (it felt he was not breathing). I gave him physical stimulus (slight slaps on the face) post which he started reviving. During this time we called 911. I gave him few sips of water forcibly and he started reviving thereafter. on 5/15 and 5/16 (post vaccination on 5/14) he was feeling tired and seemed bit dull. This was unusual as Pt is a competitive soccer player and highly active.

                                                Client received his 1st Pfizer vaccination (Lot# EW0187, EXP 08/31/21) in his left arm at 19:15 from RN.  Client?s parents and sister were with him.  Client?s parents only spoke Spanish and an interpreter was present.  After receiving his shot, client sat in a chair next to his sister while RN administered a shot to her.  Five minutes later client stated he felt nauseous.  RN immediately called out to Vaccine Runner RN and Check-in Nurse who were in the hallway to get an EMT.  Check-in Nurse radioed for an EMT to come to station 3 while Vaccine Runner RN rushed to the EMT room to ensure an EMT got the call.  Check-in Nurse stayed with the client and placed a trash can next to him in case he vomited.  RN stated the client looked pale and clammy.  At 19:26 EMT1 arrived at station 3 and collected the client?s medical history.  Interpreter was also translating the EMT?s questions and statements to the client?s parents.  Client stated he had no known allergies, no underlying conditions, and is not currently taking any medications.  Client also stated he was not experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain, or having trouble breathing.  EMT2 arrived at station 3 at 19:27 and brought the client a vomit bag.  The client had not vomited, but still felt nauseous.  EMT1 gave the client a bottle of water and juice,  and took client?s vitals at 19:28 (HR:  64, BP:  120/70).  Client stated he felt a lot better.  While walking out of station 5 Lead RN saw individuals grouped together at station 3 with the EMT and arrived at station 3 at 19:28. Lead RN was updated on client?s status.  Lead RN observed that the client was mildly pale and clammy and asked client?s mother if his current coloring was normal for the client.  Interpreter translated to both parents and client?s mother stated that the client did look a little pale.  Client stated he felt better and was just nervous about getting the shot.  At 19:30 Lead RN asked client to try and stand up. Once client was standing, Lead RN asked client if he felt dizzy and client stated no.  Client stated he felt just fine.  Lead RN and EMT?s directed the client to the observation room to sit in a zero-gravity chair for additional monitoring of 30 minutes.  EMTs walked the client and his family to the observation room and sat him in the zero-gravity chair.  Client stated he felt much better and at 19:47 EMT1 took client?s vitals (HR:  66, BP:  100/70, SpO2:  98).  EMT1 stated client?s color was returning.  EMT1 took client?s vitals again at 20:04 (HR:  67, BP:  104/78, SpO2:  99).  Lead RN arrived in observation room at 20:10 with Lead Ancillary to check on client who stood up and stated he felt good.  Lead RN observed that client was no longer pale or clammy.  Lead RN educated parents and client on potential side effects vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN further instructed client and parents to see the client?s HCP or visit urgent care if client started to experience additional common side effects for more than 24-48 hours and to call 911 if the client began to experience trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Lead Ancillary translated all the information to the client in Spanish.  Lead RN observed the client leaving with his family at 20:15. Client left walking with a steady gate.

                                                The morning after the second dose of the vaccine he woke up and felt hot and my head hurt. He had woken up feeling similar a few times during the night. When he got up he felt really queasy and threw up.  He felt really warm and continued to throw up. With Tylenol the fever was 104 degrees and it continued for several hours even after two doses of Tylenol. I was told to give Benadryl and Ibuprofen. The fever returned to 102 degrees and four later the fever broke. It was almost 10 hours where he was throwing up and the fever fluctuated between 102-104. It is very unusual for him to have any fever.  We continued the Benadryl and Ibuprofen the following day because he still had a low grade fever and some dizziness followed by diarrhea. The dizziness and Diarrhea occurred again the next day three after the vaccine.  It has been five days and he feels better but his stomach is still a little sensitive.  It is possible that he had Covid-19 last year.

A 14-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 07Jun2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2) on an unspecified date (3 weeks prior on Monday) for covid-19 immunisation. It was reported that his son who was 14 years old got the 2nd dose (Covid vaccine) of Pfizer yesterday around noon. So that was around something 17 hours ago, the reporter don&#39;t receive any information on how to handle any side effect. He apparently has headache and he has fever for 101.5 right now and he has stomach pain. But you said they were not open right now well that this was not very helpful at this point because its 5 eastern time right now. So where could get information on how to handle or what we should do with him to help him. If the reporter could go someplace for reference and couldnot contact at this point in time. Does not seem appropriate and especially giving that you know, you could do on a certain time. So pretty upset with that the reporter known it was recorded one. So, reporter hope someone on side does something about that because it was not very good practice he would try to find answers elsewhere. The outcome of the events were unknown.  Follow-up attempts are needed; information abut lot/batch number has been requested

                                                Patient reports onset of chest pain three days after his second Pfizer COVID vaccine. In the following three days after his vaccine, he had headache, decreased appetite, and mild nausea. However was still taking in fluids, decreased solid food intake. He also experienced insomnia and generalized malaise. At midnight on 07/02 he began to experience 9/10 substernal chest pain that was sharp, burning in sensation and located in the middle of the chest, non-radiating, pleuritic which lasted for several hours. Patient has had no fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, congestion, sore throat or cough. Denies any  SOB, dizziness, syncope, palpitations, edema, orthopnea. There has been no trauma to the chest. No recent URIs. He was seen at a hospital where he was found to have a trop of 1251 ng/L (converting to ~1.5 in our system) then one hour later up to 1500mg/L. His EKG at the hospital demonstrated lateral ST elevations. Had a normal CXR. He was given Maalox which was not helpful. He was transferred to another medical facility after 3 hours at the hospital.   Upon presentation to the emergency department, his vitals were stable. He had elevated CRP to 7.69, troponin was 1.0. CBC and Chem were normal. BNP normal at 15. Bedside ultrasound showed no pericardial effusion. Cardiology was consulted and ECHO showed mild left ventricular dysfunction with EF 47%. Repeat EKG here showed ongoing ST elevations in lateral leads, though mild. His pain has since improved to a 2/10. He has not required any medication for his pain. He is COVID/flu/RSV negative.   On arrival to the floor, his chest pain had completely resolved. Patient reports the pain was pleuritic, worse with exertion and improving on rest.   PMH: idiopathic urticaria  Allergies: NKDA  Family history: none reported, no cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death  Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted to the cardiology floor for continued monitoring of his troponin levels and EKG. He was then treated with IVIG 2g/kg and started on methylprednisolone IV x 2 doses. He initially had some very mild chest discomfort that improved by day 2 of admission. An echocardiogram was performed which showed improvement in his EF to 54%. Given his dysfunction, he was started on Enalapril 2.5mg twice daily. He was transitioned over to PO steroids which he tolerated well. On day of discharge, his troponin levels were trending down, and EKG was WNL. Cardiac MRI was performed and showed late gadolinium enhancement in the left ventricle. He had occasional PVCs but no arrhythmias. Viral myocarditis studies were sent and all negative.  By time of discharge, patient was well-appearing, vitals stable, demonstrating good PO intake. Prescriptions sent to preferred pharmacy. Follow up with cardiology in place. Discharge instructions and return precautions reviewed with patient and parent, who expressed good understanding and agreement with plan.  Patient will follow up in cardiology clinic next week with a repeat MRI 3-6 months.

                                                Prior to administration of the vaccine, I discussed with mom and patient about previous  immunizations and the YES response to previously fainting or felt dizzy post immunization.  Mom proceeded to state that he has a strong vaso-vagal response to needles/immunizations and he has fainted multiple times during and after immunizations.  The patient appeared calm, so I did some breathing exercises with him and when I determined that he was calm, I administered the vaccine.  Patient was still sitting upright, I asked him to continue to breathe slowly and deeply. I asked if he would like a water, and so I went to grab it from the pharmacy lab.  Patient then stated he was dizzy and was going to pass out.  He did not pass out, and I asked him if he would like to lay down. I put down a towel for him and then he started to throw up. I got a cold washcloth for his neck.  He started sweating profusely (essentially a marked cholinergic response).  I got him to lay down after some more vomiting . He stated that his vision was blurry, but he was laying down calmly.  after 25 minutes of reclining, he stated he was starting to feel a bit better. I offered a 25mg diphenhydramine tablet to help with residual nausea. He stated he was better and go shop with his family.  They did not return to the pharmacy, so as of my last interaction, he was fully recovered from the event.

Parent stated that the patient has a known allergy to peanuts but was assured that the covid19 vaccine from Pfizer does not contain any peanuts. I checked to make sure the patient didn&#39;t have any hives or swelling in any other areas of body and face. Patient was still alert and able to speak but did display some labored breathing. I had an EpiPen ready to administer but first gave him 50 mg of diphenhydramine liquid which he showed difficulty ingesting and continued to monitor while EMS was on their way. When EMS arrived they checked the patient&#39;s O2 and it was at normal levels. EMS determined patient was okay and gave the parent the option of taking the patient home or she could have him taken to the ER in an ambulance. Parent decided to take patient home.

                                                At approximately 6 PM on 05/23/2021, family was sitting down for dinner when all of a sudden she noticed that he was turning his head to the left and appeared to be falling out of his chair.  Mom states that eyes were darting back and forth at this time.  He was not responding to her shouting his name and his left arm was curled in towards his body with the rest of his body remaining stiff.  This lasted approximately 1 minute, followed by a time of confusion and drowsiness.  Approximately 1 minute later mom states that patient&#39;s eyes rolled back to his head and he had full body movement consistent with tonic-clonic seizures.  Family were able to lay him onto the ground during this time.  Mom denies any color change, apnea, or loss of bowel or bladder.  States he did have one episode of emesis following the event, and 2 episodes of emesis in the ambulance on the way to ED.  Patient has no previous history of seizures or seizure-like activity.  No new ingestions.  Has not been sick recently and denies any new sick contacts.  There has been no head trauma.   Per Mom, patient&#39;s dad has a history of &#34;partial seizures&#34; but never required any medication for them.   At arrival to the ED he continued to be drowsy and not at his normal baseline.  Continue to hold his left wrist up toward his body in a contracted manner and tended to have repetitive speech.   Briefly, ER course significant for a CT head and evaluation by pediatric neurology.  CT head was unremarkable for acute intracranial process.  A CBC, CMP, and coags were also obtained due to patient&#39;s continued contracture positioning and the possibility of a stroke.  CMP was unremarkable with a sodium of 139, potassium of 3.7, chloride of 107, bicarb 25, BUN of 12 and creatinine of 0.64.  CBC was also unremarkable with WBC of 10.72, hemoglobin of 14.8, hematocrit of 44.4 and platelets of 370.  There was 81.77% neutrophils after evaluation by neurology it was felt that the patient remained postictal and recommended that he be admitted on continuous EEG and possible MRI in the a.m.

After the 30 minutes pt gets up out of chair without difficulty and ambulates around the lobby with steady gait and denies lightheadedness, nausea/vomiting or shortness of breath.  Leaves accompanied by father.  Encouraged to push fluid, stay out of the heat today and to take it easy the rest of the day.

                                                This is a 15 year old male without PMHx  who presents with chest pain for one day after having Pfizer COVID vaccine 2-3 days prior. As per father patient had first dose without any sx except mild soreness on the site of injection. On 6/9/21 he received the second shot of Pfizer vaccine. That day he only fell mild pain on site of infection only. Next day he suffered from chills, HA, and fever. He took Tylenol for it. The day prior admission he had a mild headache and pain on the middle of the chest, dull, not radiating, and on/off. There was one episode of emesis after dinner and after taking TUMS he went to sleep. The parents check on him through the night and upon waking up he complaint still with chest pain, now increased and radiating to left side of the chest. The parents decided to bring him to ED for evaluation where he was found to have elevated troponins and he was admitted for myocarditis likely secondary to the Pfizer vaccine.  His troponins were monitored q8hrs and he was started on Toradol q6hrs. See EKG and Echo results below. Due to increasing troponins 6/13, he was given IVIG with resulting improvement. At this time, we are still monitoring his troponin inpatient with plan for potential cardiac MRI. He will be discharged home on Ibuprofen 600mg TID and follow up with cardiology with exercise restriction likely for a few months, tbd by outpatient cardiology follow up.

                                                Fifteen hours after the vaccine my son woke up and his respiratory rate was high. It was over 140. I woke him up and he had chills and diarrhea. Because of his Cortisol Deficiency I called his doctor. I was advised to give him 30mg Hydrocortisone and lots of water.  His Respiratory and heart rate were high. He was feeling a little short of breath and he had heart palpitations. We went to the ER and they did lots of testing. He had a fever and Sepsis testing. All results were normal and they gave him a Liter of fluids. He was discharged after two hours and his pulse was still high at 105-110. We monitored him and his heart rate was slowing and he started to feel better. His Endocrinologist had him take a double dose of Hydrocortisone the next day. His improvement progressed and by the fourth day the symptoms were gone.  He was able to do his normal activities but tired and worn out from the ordeal. One week later he had a slightly elevated heart rate but it resolved quickly.  He had had a local reaction in his arm with swelling and a rash after the first vaccine.

The skin around the needle puncture &#34;bubbled&#34; up and it caused him pain (more than the 1st dose when he received it). No leakage of vaccine fluid was observed. He had some soreness in the arm. The next day he did develop some nausea, body aches, and slight fever. He is feeling a bit better today (6/14) and only has some nausea remaining. Mom will take him to PCP to evaluate his Left shoulder since it is still achy.

The day following vaccine he developed fevers and chills which she treated with Tylenol.  On the morning of June 12 he developed chest pain and nausea which progressively worsened throughout the day.  That day he presented to an outside hospital emergency department where he was found to have elevated troponin and EKG with ST segment elevation.  He was then transferred to the hospital pediatric ICU for further care.  On admission to the PICU treatment was started with IV Toradol.  Echocardiogram was performed and revealed mildly decreased left ventricular systolic function.  His peak troponin level was 27.43.  He remains hemodynamically stable and was transferred to the pediatric floor.  By 6/14/2021 his chest pain had resolved and he continued to improve with NSAID therapy alone.  His troponin down trended to 2.62 on day of discharge.  Repeat echo on day of discharge showed improving but still mildly diminished systolic function.  Repeat ECG at discharge showed persistent ST elevation. He was discharged with a prescription to continue ibuprofen 600 mg 3 times daily and follow-up with pediatric cardiology in 1 to 2 weeks.

                                                Immediately following the vaccination, the patient told his father he felt dizzy, so he was directed to a chair.  He told his father he could not see anything and was experiencing vertigo.  His father then said his eyes and lips on the left side of his face seemed to be shaking as if he was having a seizure and he lost consciousness for a brief moment.  When he opened his eyes, he told his father he was dizzy and his head hurt, but he could see again.  I brought the patient some water to drink and took his first blood pressure reading at 10:42 am, which read 67/31, pulse 43.  The patient mentioned that he hadn&#39;t eaten anything that day and that he was extremely nervous about getting the vaccination.  His father got some orange juice and started to give him sips of it and he remained seated.  The next blood pressure reading at 10:54 am was 115/59, pulse 76.  The patient said that he was feeling nauseous, but less dizzy.  I gave him two cookies to eat and took his blood pressure again at 11:01 am and it read 117/73, pulse 88.  At this point, the patient said he was feeling much better and the cookies even made the nausea go away.  The final blood pressure reading was at 11:13 am:  122/63, pulse 76.  At this point, the said he felt completely better and father was confident in taking him home, so they left.  I followed up with the father two days later on 6/25/21 and he said that he didn?t have any more problems after they left the store.  That evening, patient&#39;s temperature went up to 99 and his head hurt with movement, but otherwise, he was fine and did not have any more symptoms after that.

Vaccine was administered at pharmacy.  First dose received on 5/15/2021, second dose on 6/5/2021. Fatigue and chills started a few hours after second dose and then developed shortness of breath, nausea, emesis and 8/10 midsternal chest pain. Presented to an urgent care facility where CXR and EKG were obtained. EKG showed early repolarizations. Labs were obtained at a local ED and showed elevated troponins, initially 11k and then to 20k and peaked there. BNP was within normal limits. Subsequent EKG showed diffuse ST-segment elevations concerning for acute pericarditis. No prior infections or symptoms like this previously. He was given colchicine at outside facility prior to transfer. At hospital he was continued on ibuprofen and monitored with telemetry and had ECHO and cardiac MRI. Latter was consistent with myopericarditis. ECHO showed normal function. He received PPI while on NSAIDs. His symptoms resolved and he was discharged to home on 6/10/2021 with activity restrictions and plan to follow-up with peds cardiology. Of note, there was an error submitting the initial VAERS report for this patient during the admission, therefore, this delayed report is being submitted.

We slowed his descent, but he had a small abrasion on his head (I think from the carpet).  He said he felt dizzy and nauseous.  I&#39;m  not sure if he was also watching while I was giving his sibling the shot and  that exacerbated the situation. We had him checked out by EMT and he was fine after the initial fainting.

His mother had been sick with acute gastroenteritis symptoms 2 days earlier. Over the course of the day, he had a fever to 101.6 F, and began to have loose stools (twice). He received Ibuprofen 400 mg by mouth every 6 hours for the fever, and drank plenty of fluids. On June 3, 2021, he continued to have fevers to 101.5 F, loose stools (twice again), and poor oral intake of food. I canceled his scheduled 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and got him a NP swab test for SARS-CoV-2 through the health department. On June 4, 2021, he had no fever but now complained of a rubbing left parasternal chest pain. On physical examination, his BP was elevated (130s/90s), he had a slight tachycardia (90s), and was afebrile. On auscultation, I heard a S4 gallop and took him immediately to the local ER.

                                                Patient had a vagal response caused by an anxiety attack due to fear of needles. Technician, gave the vaccine and then immediately called me in. The mother and son were worried about the needle disappearing due to the retraction mechanism. The son was loosing color in his face and becoming dizzy. I had him sit upright, talked with him for a few minutes, gave him Benadryl as a precaution, and checked his blood pressure. He was having no difficulty breathing and blood pressure was WNL. His mother said that he has passed out with needles before and that he had not eaten today. Eventually the patient claimed to lose his sight, and within 30s passed out. He was still sitting in the chair, bent over, vomited, and then immediately came back to consciousness. The patient then said that he felt fine and wanted to leave. I talked with him and his mother for around 20 minutes, had him eat a banana, and drink a full bottle of water. After the time, he felt fine and him and his mother left.

Labwork done  at that time showed modest nonspecific elevations of inflammatory markers CRP of 42,  (normal &lt; 8), ESR 50, calprotectin 285 (120 limit).  SARS covid-19 antibody semiquant to spike protein RBD was 64.4 U/mL (&lt;0.8, Labcorp).  Other tests did not identify another specific etiology, and an evaluation by another physician for myocarditis was reportedly normal.  As of 7/17 he feels better with a resolution of all symptoms, labwork repeated this past week (7/15) showed a resolution of those same inflammatory markers to normal levels .

A 15-year-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0173 F) via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 07Jun2021 as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing known allergy in mosquito bite (sketter syndrome) an allergic reaction to mosquito bites, as his son has grown up it has become less and less relevant. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously received first dose of bnt162b2 (Dose:01 Lot number: EW0171 Anatomical Location: Arm left) on 17May2021 for COVID-19 immunization. It was unknown if the patient received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, was the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient been tested for COVID-19. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations dates of birth or immunizations are not available. It was reported that my son traveled on 16May2021. Covid test prior traveling negative. On Jun2021, 4 days after vaccination develop GI, heavier insomia, dierrea, vomiting, fever, hypotensive, dehydraeted. On 11Jun2021 experienced pericardial effusion. On an unknown date Jun2021, developed into MISC and was intubated. The patient was hospitalized from 14 Jun 2021 to 6 Jul 2021. Treatment was received. On 15Jun2021, admission at (withheld), (Hidratation IV and IVIGs). On 16Jun2021 condition worsen and Intubated in (withheld). On 17Jun2021, transfer to (withheld) (7 days at PICU, another 7 at pediatrics). On Jun2021, developed a strong insomnia and headache. Events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment received for the adverse event was MISC protocol IVIGsAnakinra, esteroids and others. On an unknown date, Patient said he had 4 vaccines. His son spent 7 days in the ICU and 7 days in the pediatric unit was discharged from the hospital yesterday. Reported that other researchers studying MIS-C in children have seen how the epithelium cells in the intestine become loose, then the protein goes through the blood stream and can start a cytokine storm and asked if we have studies regarding how much S protein is being produced by different age groups; can it be checked how much S protein is going into the bloodstream to see adverse effects of the vaccine and stated he needs more data to see if his son was possibly infected with Covid during his vaccination period or what he previously infected and absolutely asymptomatic. Most MIS-C occurs 4-6 weeks after having Covid. States that for his son to travel he had to have antigen testing, which was negative. His son did well until 3-4 days after the second shot. States at that time his son became ill with vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and insomnia. She took her son to the hospital and they found him to be hypotensive and dehydrated. They started intravenous fluids and their protocols; the hospital did not have all the required medications for their son and recommended he be transferred to (withheld) Hospital. He was very tired and they decided to put him on ventilation for the ambulance drive. States that when they arrived in (withheld), his son was placed in ICU where he was on the ventilator for 5 days, the recuperating for 2 more days. His son was then moved throughout the hospital system until his discharge yesterday. His son&#39;s insomnia may have started before he left for the (withheld). States that it was worsened after the vaccine, his son mentioned after his hospitalization that he was actually given 4 shots the day he got his vaccines, assumed it to be some kind of delirium from his son being in the ICU for so long, stated he told his son that was not possible that he got 4 vaccines at once because of the paperwork you have to fill out to get the vaccine, the lady at the vaccination site told him to sit down and then gave shothim four shots. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included IgG and IgM resulted as positive on 15Jun2021, PCR resulted as negative on 15Jun2021 Nasal Swab, PCR resulted as positive on 17Jun2021 Nasal Swab. The clinical outcome of the event developed MIS-C and was intubated, vomiting, dierrea, headache, insomnia, hypotensive, dehydrated on an unknown date 2021 was resolved and the event pericardial effusion, develop GI, fever was resolving, the event condition worsen, Vaccination failure, patient said he had 4 vaccines and PCR resulted as positive on 17Jun2021 Nasal Swab was unknown; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the limited information currently available, the causal association between the event Insomnia, Diarrhea, vomiting, fever, Drug ineffective, COVID-19, Headache, overdose and the suspect drug cannot be excluded. Also, there is limited information in the case provided, the causal association between the event Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, Pericardial effusion, Gastrointestinal inflammation, Condition worsened, Hypotensive, Dehydration and the suspect drug cannot be excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                Patient presented 3 weeks after the vaccine with worsening dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, cough that began 2 days after vaccine administration. Two days prior to presentation to Harbor ER on 7/1/2021 he had nausea and  vomiting with a fever 101F on day of presentation. He was found to be in congestive heart failure with severely diminished biventricular function. While inpatient he had worsening respiratory status requiring CPAP and O2 though he improved with initiation of diuresis.  His inflammatory markers were not elevated and he had negative troponins. cMRI revealed an LVEF 13% with no signs of active myocarditis. Viral studies were negative and there was no evidence of bacterial infection. Prior to this, he was in his USOH with no limitations. He was seen in cardiology clinic 5/2021 and was stable at that time.  He required initiation of diuretics and oral heart failure management and was discharged with close follow-up.

                                                Patient is a 15 year old M with hypofibrinogenemia, platelet aggregation disorder and history of COVID admitted to Inpatient Ward from 26 June - 01 July for work-up and management of new onset and severe headache, photophobia, and pain with extraocular movement. Extensive work-up complete but still unclear etiology, though near complete resolution of symptoms with IV steroids.   Neuro: CSF positive for HHV-6, still unclear if this fully explains presentation. CT and brain MRI negative, though limited exam due to braces artifact. Headache complicated by clear post-LP postural headache, though this improved throughout hospitalization, with nausea moderately controlled on Benadryl. Neurology and Ophthalmology consulted, who both thought peri-neuritis was plausible, which is consistent given such rapid improvement with steroids. Pain moderately controlled with Tylenol. Oligoclonal bands and MBP CSF studies pending at time of discharge. Plan for 7-day steroid taper as an outpatient (outlined below in patient instructions), and Neurology follow-up in about 1 month.  ID: Initially empirically covered with Ceftriaxone and Acyclovir, but once negative CSF, both were discontinued. He remained afebrile throughout remainder of hospitalization, so no further antibiotics started. Had remote history of immunodeficiency (confirmed here to be IgA deficiency), underwent more extensive immune work-up with lymphocyte subset 6 pending at time of discharge.   Fen/GI: Nausea and poor PO intake secondary to headache and neurologic symptoms. Unremarkable KUB with no focal findings on exam. Tolerated good liquid PO intake prior to discharge, improving food intake with help of Benadryl and Reglan (Zofran did not help his nausea). Given risk of Reglan side effects, trial of Benadryl alone was given and relieved his nausea.  Will discharge with Benadryl PRN for nausea, though expect this to improve.    Heme: No blood transfusions required, no history of recent bleeding/trauma, no signs of active bleeding. Received TXA for three days following his LP performed on 6/28.  Rheumatology: Patient has preexisting appointment with Rheumatology scheduled on 7/9 due to a history of intermittent joint pain/swelling with skin color changes since April 2020. Ordered requested Rheumatology labs by Doctor while patient is admitted. CRP and ESR resulted normal at 0.31 and 8 (respectively), C3 and C4 within normal limits, dsDNA and ANA negative. Repeat ESR on 6/30 also normal at 10. Pending labs include fecal procalcitonin. Follow up appointment with Rheumatology on 7/9.   CV: Some concern for myocarditis at time of presentation given pleuritic chest pain, history of COVID-19 infection, and recent COVID-19 vaccination. EKG at that time revealed nonspecific T wave changes. However, troponin and BNP resulted negative and patient&#39;s chest pain has resolved at this time. Discussed with Cardiology who did not think further work-up was necessary. Chest pain completely resolved at time of discharge.

Upon walking to the car, patient vomited 3x and was escorted back inside by EMS. Patient stated he had a headache immediately following vaccine. Upon re-entry into the building, patient was given juice and water and started to feel better. Upon interviewing the mother, she stated the patient came from a 3 hour long football practice this AM and barely slept last night. Mother states she thinks the vomiting &#34;was more from heat exhaustion&#34; than the vaccine. Patient remained monitored by EMS until he felt better, patient left with mother after symptoms resolved.
