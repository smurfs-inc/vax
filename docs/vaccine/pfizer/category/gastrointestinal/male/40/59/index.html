COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

Brain fog, dizziness, and nausea continued for the rest of the shift. 5 hours after the vaccine (10pm) he was very fatigued. When he woke up the next morning his arm felt like it &#34;was in a vice&#34; and he is still hazy.

I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

I was put on a GI, Allergy, and steroid medications. I was hooked up to an IV and 3 drugs were injected. I passed out numerous times but was discharged at 5am.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

Vital signs were assessed by a Registered Nurse and a Physician. Oxygen saturation was noted to be 88% on 2 liters of O2 by nasal cannula. Verbal order received at 10:03am from Physician and EpiPen administered to right thigh with improvement of symptoms. She was transferred to the Emergency Department (ED) via stretcher. In the ED, she was re-dosed with an EpiPen secondary to her airway type symptoms. She was reevaluated after 15 minutes and received Solu-Medrol, Pepcid, Benadryl IV, as well as IV fluids. She also received Ativan for her generalized jitteriness and anxiety. She improved and felt significantly better at approximately 11:43am.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

                                                Received vaccine on 12/21/2020.  Developed constipation that cleared on 12/26/2020 with use of colace.  Had episode of diarrhea on 12/28/2020.  Abdominal pain began at 2330 on 12/29/2020 and worsened through the night.  Went to ER at 0500 hours on 12/30/2020 where I was diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent appendectomy on the same day by Dr.  I have no idea if this is related to the vaccine or simply a coincidence.  In error of caution, I am reporting this.  Thank you.

                                                While on duty and in uniform as an emergency paramedic I received my second  scheduled covid19 vaccination.  Approximately five minutes after receiving  C19 dose 2 vaccination (1335hrs). I experienced a syncopal episode while walking back to my work area and was lowered to the ground by another EMS provider. I was then placed in a wheelchair by the  EMS provider and an RN and taken to the emergency department at Medical Center. (1337hrs)  I  regained alertness and felt severe nausea and general weakness and was assisted into in ER bed.  Staff doctor attended along with RN . An assessment was completed, 12 lead EKG completed, IV established, 8mg Zofran administered, 1000ml of Normal Saline was bolused. Labs were drawn.  ED staff continued to monitor me for the next  2 plus hours I was monitored for anaphylaxis and other symptoms. My symptoms of nausea mostly resolved and my strength returned.  A Resident MD completed a final evaluation and determined it was safe for me to be discharged. (1607hrs)

A 45-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL6269), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 04Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 45-years-old) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. 51 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting down watching a film. His left arm began to tingle, and he felt a wave of dizziness and nausea come over him. He stood up, walked a few steps and sat back down. He broke out in a cold sweat, chills, and saw stars. He leaned forward with his head in his hands, and apparently fainted for a moment and lost control of his bladder. All events started on 06Feb2021 06:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. No covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1685; expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper right arm on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure high, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hypertension all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, and was a former smoker. Concomitant medication included lisinopril and methylphenidate. The patient reported that after he received the vaccine, he tested positive for Covid on 30Dec2020. The patient further reported that he ended up getting significant gastritis on Christmas Eve, which he didn&#39;t think about acquiring COVID, he had had the vaccine, he ate a bunch of holiday fare, so he thought he had got a stomach bug or something like that. He says he had considerable diarrhea on Christmas morning, but no fever or chills, then those symptoms resolved by Saturday, and he didn&#39;t think about it, he didn&#39;t have any issues. He says that he went to get tested, which they do frequently, and his temperature was checked frequently at the places he goes and he had no fever, and is still not febrile now. He says that he gets a weekly COVID test which allows for him to enter different facilities, and this was the first time in 9 months that he tested positive since this all came out. He says he has worked in some heavy duty places, but he wears his PPE, his respirator, his shield, and still did this stuff after he got the vaccine, he didn&#39;t let his guard down since it might take a while for immunity to kick in, but he still didn&#39;t think that it could be possible to have COVID on Christmas Eve, he was rather surprised he was positive. The patient confirms that he hasn&#39;t had the second dose of the vaccine yet. He says that his diarrhea improved on day or two starting after he had been having bloating on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. He says his diarrhea resolved, he took no medication for it, and had no change in his heart rate or breathing, no problems anywhere else, he didn&#39;t feel that bad, except for the going to the bathroom. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: positive on 30Dec2020. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this subject cannot be completely excluded.  Further information like confirmative virus genome /nucleic acid detection needed for meaningful medical assessment.

Concomitant medication included ongoing lansoprazole (PREVACID) for acid reflux (esophageal) from Nov2020. The patient stated his diarrhea worsened 2 hours after receiving the vaccine (24Feb2021 at 19:00) and had diarrhea again around 10 pm. The patient stated hearing loss was already there and the vaccine actually exacerbated the situation in 2021. The patient also experienced ringing in my ear in 2021. The patient&#39;s nurse, primary care doctor, and gastroenterologist stated it was okay to receive the vaccine as the patient was in the middle of a flare up with his IBS (inflammatory bowel syndrome) in 2021. Treatment for the event hearing loss exacerbated included unspecified steroids and has been working. The outcome of the events diarrhea worsened and ringing in my ear was unknown. The outcome of the events hearing loss exacerbated and having a flare was recovering.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma, dry cough due to inhalation from fires over the years.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Contracted Covid after receiving the first vaccine was reported. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, then contracted Covid. He now had the option to receive antibodies through plasma. Since he had the vaccine, was that still an option? Or was that a no-no? He received the vaccine at work on 21Dec2020. He got sick on 22Dec2020 and he was at home. He didn&#39;t feel like eating, and can&#39;t lay down because it made it worse to cough. He didn&#39;t know what vitamins they were giving him. The patient probably should be in a hospital, but was not. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer on January 19, 2021.   3 days post vaccination (January 22, 2021) I developed right eye discomfort/irritation,  prickly sensations in throat.     On Jan 25, 2021 I developed tinnitus in right ear  which has still not resolved.     On January 30, 2021, went to ED with elevated BP 170/110, abdominal pain and tinnitus.    Had an abdominal  CT scan with contrast  which showed mesenteric inflammation (idiopathic etiology).   Was seen and evaluated by GI and had colonoscopy and endoscopy with no significant findings.    Took solu-medrol dose pack and abdominal pain symptoms  improved, but still not fully resolved.   On Feb 16 was seen by PCP for persisting, unilateral tinnitus.   Sent for MRI Brain which was normal .   Referred  for further evaluation by audiologist and otolaryngologist .  Was seen on  February 25, 2021 for right ear fullness, tinnitus.    Hearing test normal.   Diagnosed with right sided tinnitus.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included Covid-19 from 17Jul2020 to 14Aug2020, he didn&#39;t get hospitalized but was pretty sick. He had circulation issues with it. He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3246), intramuscular on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 12Jan2021, the evening after the vaccine was administered, the patient experienced chills, bone aches, and minor HA that then worsened to explosive diarrhea and violent vomiting with a jaundice color of skin. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.

A 56-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 at 10.30 (at the age of 56-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago, blood cholesterol diagnosed about 7 years ago, Covid-19 in Dec2020 which hit him pretty hard, double pneumonia, he was wiped out, patient had a shingles vaccine a couple of years ago he had a fever and it felt like he had the flu, for about 48 hours he was wiped out. This happened with both doses of the shingles vaccine. Concomitant medication(s) included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). On 24Mar2021 (Wednesday), patient experienced double pneumonia, body aches/i started aching, my arm hurt, headache, tired/fatigue/exhausted, i got the chills, my skin felt like it was sunburned, cough, fog, no appetite, sweating, sore arm, he had a previous flu like symptoms after the shingles vaccine. It was reported that all the same symptoms the patient had with COVID, the caller had after the vaccine. The next morning was much worse and through that next day. Patient describes his side effects like a mini Covid 19 reaction. The symptoms were very similar to the symptoms he had 4 days into his Covid-19 diagnosis. It was reported that on Friday (26Mar2021) he felt normal and was able to workout on Saturday (27Mar2021) as usual. The patient believes his antibodies are strong following his virus and then the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. The patient doesn&#39;t think he had a fever, but he didn&#39;t have that with covid along with no loss of taste and smell. The patient was very grateful for the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests which included blood cholesterol and blood pressure whose results are reported as high on an unknown date. The outcome of the event double pneumonia was unknown, and for all other events it was recovered.

The injection site got quite red about the second day of the reaction. the muscle pain and joint pain was getting worse. I got to take NSAID&#39;s, Toradol injection 30mg IM which worked quite well.

About 17 hours after receiving the second does on 1/11/2021, flu-like symptoms reoccurred.  The following day (1/13/2021) severe chills, and difficulty breathing occurred. Patient was admitted to Medical Center, where blood work, EKG, and oxygen were given and ordered. After overnight observation, the patient was discharged and informed that he had a severe reaction due to the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19. As of 1/17/2021, patient still recovering and feeling generally weak and tired without much appetite.

                                                PRESENTING PROBLEM: Syncope and collapse [R55]   HOSPITAL COURSE: History of Present Illness:  57-year-old man known to me for bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral pleural effusions of unknown etiology and mild decrease in pulmonary mechanics, DVT on Eliquis who came to the Emergency Room 3/12/21 with a chief complaint of near syncope.   Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion
