COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

A 40-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0142), via an unspecified route of administration in left deltoid/left arm on 05Jan2021 at a single dose  for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure diagnosed about 7 years ago and ongoing GERD that he had his entire life. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the first vaccine on 05Jan2021, then tested positive for COVID-19. The patient added that he experienced fever of 103, body aches, headache, cough, fatigue, nausea and vomiting and diarrhea times one week.Had COVID test Friday, 08Jan2021 and positive test result received on Saturday, 09Jan2021.

However, full immunity is only expected 2 weeks after the second dose.

I went to an medical center on 2/16 to receive the Rapid, PCR, and flu differential tests. My Rapid test came back negative but my PCR test came back positive on 2/17.

He was very winded. On March 7, we skipped exercise. On March 8, patient tried to do simple stretching exercise, and couldn&#39;t do it. He got winded and shaky. On March 9, he was seen at an urgent care where he was told he had an inverted T wave on his EKG and a very fast heart rate (125 resting pulse). He was told to not exercise and to make an appointment with a cardiologist. On March 9, I called the urgent care clinic to ask questions about monitoring his blood pressure and when to seek more medical care. I spoke with Dr, who prescribed Atenolol. Around 4:30 pm on

Consultation 1 Comments discussed with  RPh.  He will come to ER to obtain additional information from patient.  This is the hospital&#39;s first presumptive Pfizer vaccine reaction. ? Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.  His skin is now warm and moist (not sweatty , not diaphoretic).  The rash is receeding from the arms. Good coloration to the legs/ankles.  Back &amp; torso rash starting to recede.  no nausea/vomiting. no difficulty breathing. still with fading macular rash on the torso and upper back.

Patient rash has faded from his extremities fully and appears to have faded from his abdomen still somewhat at the malar area of the cheeks as well as the neck and torso portion of the chest.  His pulse is 98?99 continues to have elevated blood pressure.  Pulse oximetry 98-100% on room air, normal.  Pharmacist will enter the reaction into the CDC/FDA/Pfizer database. Overall pt notes he feels tired (probably related to hydration &amp; benadryl).  He notes he has returned to home about 2 weeks ago after spending some time on the road in mountains playing guitar / touring with a small band , playing music. ? Time #3 15:37 ? Recheck #3 patient stable ? Comments #3 He has been resting.  No respiratory distress.  His blood pressure and pulse and pulse oximetry are reviewed at bedside and they are nonfocal at this time.  Overall he is improving.  He notes he still has malaise and feels about the same with itching in his back and the sensation in his throat.  When I evaluate his back there is hyperemia/some macular rash that is in approximately the distribution of the trapezius muscle of the back this is where he notes he has the itching.  Additionally when I evaluate his throat there is still some presence of uvula edema.  There is no other angioedema.  Perhaps he does have some mild hyperemia to the uvula and soft palate at this time.  He is clinically improving but his symptoms have not resolved fully.  Skin warm and dry normal turgor.

On an unspecified date in Apr2021, the patient began to have severe abdominal pain so he went to the emergency room and was evaluated and then about 8 am it was confirmed that he had early appendicitis. The event was considered serious for hospitalization. Patient would like to know if his appendicitis diagnosis is related to the COVID vaccine or if it is completely irrelevant. The outcome of the event was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

This was followed a couple of hours later by body aches, alternate hot and cold spells and headache. Injection site was sore, which started the previous day. Massive headaches from 4/9 to 4/11. NSAIDs somewhat helped symptoms. Began feeling human on 4/12. Was like a bad influenza, but no one else in household had any symptoms subsequently, so assume it was the vaccination.

Cramps continued through Friday, April 30 with varying intensity. Attempted to treat with Tylenol and GasX.  Starting around 10:30 a.m. on Saturday May, 1, the pain in my left side increased in intensity and was not waning. After consulting with a telehealth practitioner, I  went to the emergency room and was quickly admitted. My blood and urine were tested, along with CT scans of my body. The CT scan revealed that blood was no longer reaching two parts of my left kidney and I was diagnosed with a arterial thrombosis.   I was fully admitted to the hospital and a heparin drip was immediately started.

                                                I developed sudden-onset, severe, crushing pain in my left shoulder, radiating down my left arm.  This is the location where I received my vaccine one month prior.  The pain was 8/10 and lasted approximately 7 hours.  It woke me from sleep.  I also experienced nausea.  I tried Tylenol 1000mg, ice, and heat.  Nothing helped.  I went to the Urgent Care.  They did multiple EKGs and lab tests.  They ruled out a heart attack and pulmonary embolism.  There was no injury.  They were unable to find any cause for the pain.  They administered aspirin, protonix, and nitroglycerin.  The pain resolved after the third dose of nitroglycerin.  (I was told by the cardiology PA that this was probably a coincidence.)

Severe fatigue and constant fever as high as 105 for three days, and finally went to the ER. Immediately treated for sepsis. Full blood panel, blood cultures, x-ray and CT scan. Also ran some additional cultures for respiratory  pathogens. The Dr?s had a tough time determining what it was. They saw a very small area which they called pneumonia, however, I?ve had pneumonia and this was not what it was. Final discharge paperwork stated Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome.

                                                Starting the next day after the vaccine 1st dose, I notice a throbbing pain right below my stomach.  I did not take any medications.  I went to the doctor after 2 weeks of having this pain.  They did blood test and urine sample and was referred to the ER for a CT scan.  Everything came back normal.   I was still having abdominal pain and was referred to a GI specialist. The GI performed sigmoidscopy (normal) and nothing was prescribed and to follow up in a few months.  I am still having abdominal pain, but it is very mild and has not effected my quality of life.

                                                Following the vaccination on 2/23/21, Pt had fever, chills, fatigue the first two days. On the third and fourth days, he added diarrhea and headache to those symptoms.  He felt awful over the weekend and spoke to his doctor on Monday, 3/1.  The doctor began him on steroids and ivermectin. Over the next 24 hours his breathing began to worsen. He entered the hospital on Tuesday, 3/2, for supplemental oxygen. Things continued to get worse. He was intubated and put on a ventilator on 3/6/21 and ultimately spent 13 days in a coma. He was extubated on 3/19/21 but then had seizures on 3/20/21 and had to be reintubated to secure his airway. Pt was taken back off the ventilator on 3/24/21. He suffered vocal cord paralysis and ultimately wound up with both a PEG tube and tracheotomy. He was discharged from the hospital after 43 days and then spent 10 days in an inpatient rehab center. He continues to deal with vocal cord issues, tracheal stenosis, nerve damage in his neck and shoulder, muscle atrophy, and damaged lungs.

On Mon heart rate increased again. Went to Urgent Care and tested covid negative. On Wed 12/30, BP at 180/105. Went to ED and BP eventually went down to 145/95. Dr is speculating that since patient had high antibodies from covid infection in August and still high antibodies in October that all of this is a wild immune reaction triggered by the vaccine.

For the next 6 days experienced debilitating headaches, which led to nausea (because they were so severe). Elevated blood pressure also coupled with headaches.  I initially took Ibuprofen (which helped somewhat), whereas Tylenol did nothing. I also have a flexible ice pack that I placed over my head. That also helped a little. I went to the doctor on March 17th, but he was dismissive of the headaches being related to the vaccine. I have since been referred to  a neurologist (April 1st appointment).

Since then there has been nausea and headache, and I have trouble sleeping in. I feel some more discomfort after eating food.  I have intermittent fever also. It has been about 10 days today since I got my COVID Pfizer shot  and I still don&#39;t feel physically well. I just wanted to report this, as the impression from documentation I read is that symptoms should go away in 3-4 days.

An acute stomach ache followed and continued until the morning of April 4th. After vomiting stopped, I laid in bed from about 3pm on April 3 until 9 am on the 4th...I would sleep for 45 minutes at a time and wake in a cold sweat...I physically felt very cold, but was drenched in sweat. The chills and cold sweats stopped on the morning of the 4th and gave way to a lingering but persistent headache and dull stomach ache which are continuing now (3pm on April 4), but seem to be slowly fading.

                                                Headache - 4 days and still comes and goes sometimes being very extreme. Fatigue - Started feeling tired around 5:00pm the day of the vaccine and I have continued to feel tired after 4 days. Muscle/Joint pain - Started getting sore arm first a couple hours after shot then progressively getting worse on my entire body for 3 days.  On day two is was almost unbearable with my lower back being the most painful.  I could not sleep because of the pain with no position that would relief it. Chills - Started getting chills on the evening of the vaccine.  They came and went for 3 days. On the second day it was uncontrollable shakes no matter how many blankets I used. Fever - Started the night of my vaccine increasing to 102.4 and reaching the highest on the second day at 103.5.  I took ibuprofen every 6 hours for two days straight with it staying steady at above 100. Nausea - Started the evening of the vaccine and got very severe.  It has continued for 4 days. Fast Heartbeat - It has stayed consistently above 110  and sometime getting up to 130 while laying in bed shivering.

As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

Started my work day from home with a meeting at 0900 and knew by 0920 that I had to take the day off.   Spent the entire rest of the day and night in bed. Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

                                                Began with mild abdominal pain which gradually increased to severe abdominal pain that lasted through the night (approx. 12 hrs). Contacted a telehealth doctor who suggested I monitor the pain and go to ER if I had trouble breathing.  I took one 200mg ibuprofen to relieve the pain. The following day (5/11) the abdominal pain was moderate and seemed to decrease throughout the day. The day after (5/12) I felt discomfort but pain was minimal. Today (5/13) feel minor discomfort on occasion. Since the abdominal pain began I have not vomited or had diarrhea. The only symptom from the vaccine seems to be the abdominal pain.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

                                                going to throw up; dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer from a Pfizer sponsored -program, Pfizer First Connect. A 42-year-old male patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231), intramuscular on 22Dec2020 15:15 at a single dose to prevent COVID. Medical history included retinal blood clot in his retina which was why he was tested for RA, and Meniere&#39;s disease for which he was asked to try meclizine which was for inner ear but he did not start taking meclizine, and six years ago, they did blood work and he was told he may have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or he may have markers for RA but he has had no further issues and does not take any medication for this. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced dizziness on 06Jan2021. The dizziness was increasing and he felt it most of the time. On 07Jan2021, he started feeling swimmy headed and he left work on 11Jan2021 since he was told he looked horrible. He never leaves work. He went to the clinic on the 11th since he felt like he was dizzy and going to throw up. The next day he did not feel better. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                Felt immediate headache, followed by extreme exhaustion, fatigue, body aches (the same day as the 2nd dose) within about 10 minutes after it; and for the next two days. Felt better by 02/14/2021. Began feeling ill again on 02/17/2021, body aches, extreme fatigue, feeling very hot but not having a fever, nausea. It seemed to get better on about 02/21/2021, but then on 02/22/2021, all of the same feelings and symptoms came back and are still present today. I have reached out to my primary doctor to let him know and he suggested that I submit this information here as well.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

Nausea has continued to be a big issue from the night of injection until today, which is Monday, 3/29/2021.   On Saturday night (3/27) I experienced overwhelming stomach pain and nearly passed out on my toilet multiple times during a bout of diarrhea.

                                                30-35 minutes after injection, while I was driving home, I felt some minor difficulty swallowing., but no impediment to breathing or speaking.  I rerouted to a plaza with a grocery store and urgent care clinic, and bought some Benadryl and took it at about 2:55PM.  I waited 20 minutes in the parking lot before deciding I was safe to drive home. When I read about the possibility of a biphasic reaction, where my throat could close up again later, I went to a Clinic (5:40PM walk-in appointment with NP), and they could not treat me, and advised me to go to the Emergency Room. I initially decided to just go home, but went to the Emergency Room out of an abundance of caution at around 7PM.  Dr.  gave me a prescription for an epi pen and prednisone, just in case symptoms worsened.  They did not, and I did not use either drug.  The throat swelling started around 2:45PM and worsened for about half an hour. It remained steady (no airway constriction, no difficulty taking pills or drinking water) without getting worse, and started to subside around 5PM.  By the time I woke up this morning (3/31), I don&#39;t think there is any lingering swelling.  I can feel a very slight lump in my throat, but I can&#39;t tell if that is a very small amount of residual swelling or just hyper-vigilance based on yesterday&#39;s experience.  Note: This swelling feeling is identical to my memory of what I felt when I was diagnosed as allergic to penicillin in 2000 or 2001. Back then, the only &#34;treatment&#34; was to immediately stop taking penicillin (and to never take it again), based on a phone call with my doctor&#39;s office.  I did have a strong immune response after that (102° fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain), but I don&#39;t consider that an adverse reaction.  This report is focused on what appeared to be a mild anaphylactic reaction.

                                                Patient was given first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  I counseled the patient on side effects and asked him to wait 15 minutes afterwards in our waiting area.  After about 5 minutes, the patient starting complaining of feeling dizzy.  We asked him to sit back in the chair and brought him a bottle of water.  I asked the patient if he had eaten today and he replied no.  I offered a snack and also a glucose tablet to help with shakiness.  As I went to get a bottle of glucose tablets off the shelf, the patient fainted and fell out of his chair.  I immediately ran to get an Epipen while my technicians called for a Code White and 911.  I was about to inject the patient with the Epipen when he came to about 10 seconds later.  He said he was really hot, sweaty, dizzy, and nauseous.  Paramedics and AP arrived to evaluate him and take a statement.  Patient left on his own will and received a ride home from his mother-in-law, who is an associate at our store.

                                                1 minute after vaccine injection I experienced a tightening of my throat.  It was very uncomfortable and made it difficult to swallow  and felt like a &#34;lump in my throat&#34;.  I asked an onsite nurse if this was a common reaction, and she offered medical attention.  I denied it because it was not getting worse.  She gave me a bottle of water and it seemed to help it a bit while drinking.  But, quickly returned after water was swallowed.  I was monitored for 30 minutes as recommended.  The tightness remained for 1 hour post vaccine injection and disappeared as quickly as it started.  I fear the second dose may be worse.

Within ten minutes, started having congestion in chest (rattles). This caused strong bouts of coughing with pain radiation through my lungs. I then started vomiting (x3). I started feeling fatigued so I went to lie down, when I had a cold chill. At 3:00 pm, my temp was 102 F. At 3:15, it was 102.5 F, and then crested at 103 F at 3:30. In the past five hours, the only symptom to subside was vomiting; all the others are still present with my current temp 102.1 F at 8:41 pm.

                                                Patient started noticing dark stools the day after vaccination (4/15) and began vomiting blood on 4/16. One episode of vomiting resulted in a syncopal episode in which the patient hit their head, causing a laceration which required staples. The patient does report intermittent abdominal pain over the course of the past few weeks, but today is more severe and the first time he has experienced bloody emesis. Upon presentation patient was tachycardic, hypotensive, and pale. Patient reports he does not frequently consume alcohol. Patient received a pantoprazole bolus and drip, an octreotide drip, and PRBC. Patient also received several doses of ondansetron. Patient is being admitted for care.

                                                About six hours after receiving my shot, my arm became extremely sore, as to be expected.  Circa 9pm I began to have  significant trouble breathing, experienced acute pain in my abdomen, and began to hear ringing in my ears combined with feeling like I was going to pass out. I didn?t feel dizzy, rather I started getting tunnel vision that blocked out more of my field of view as the ringing increased.  Circa 11pm, I lost consciousness while trying to move and collapsed on the floor. My wife called 911 while I was unresponsive, and I regained consciousness while being attended to by EMTs who checked my vitals. Around 12am I didn?t feel like I was going to lose consciousness again, and the EMTs recommended I be taken to the hospital. Since I was feeling better I politely declined.   Today I am still feeling foggy and have joint pain (in addition to some bruising from falling after losing consciousness , but I no longer have the acute abdominal pain.

                                                Patient warned us before his covid vaccine that he has a severe needle phobia and has fainted after vaccines.  I gave him his immunization quickly and he did well.  He stood up and watched as I immunized his wife.  He said he was feeling okay afterwards so both him and his wife left the immunization room.  Shortly after leaving he must have started getting dizzy, because next thing I hear is that there is an unconscious man in the waiting room.  He is sitting in a chair with his head back unresponsive.  His wife if rubbing his arms and lightly slapping his face.  He comes to, and we decide to move him to the room that the clinic uses (we have a walk in clinic staffed with a NP).  He lays on the floor, and within a minute he proceds to vomit approximately 4 times.  He also lost control of his bladder.  He was pale with cold and clammy skin.  we moved him so we could put his feet up on a chair and allowed him to rest.  Someone went to get him an ice pack to put on his head and chest.  His blood pressure was low (90/50ish).   He still was not feeling better after 30 minutes so we called the ambulance.  He did not want to go to the hospital so the paramedics monitored him.  his blood pressure slowly started going up and normalizing, and he left with his wife.

                                                initially began as what felt like jolts to my chest area from inside my chest over five days beginning on March 31, 21 @ 1:20am; next on April 01, 2021 @ 12:02am; then April 02, 2021 @1:02am; then April 03, 2021 @ 1:36am; and on April 04, 2021 @ 2:46am. I ended up in the emergency room the afternoon of Sunday March 04, 2021 with severe chest, abdominal, and intestinal pain. I followed up with doctors on April 05, 2021; April 09, 2021; and April 28, 2021 with continued painful symptoms described below. All they has done so far is 1) took a chest X-ray, 2) taken blood, and 3) referred me to a sleep laboratory.  The X-ray and blood work came back negative per ER.  Symptoms: 1. Inability to sleep. most nights feels as if I just drank five cups of coffee before bed. When I am able to fall asleep, pain and/or jolts coming from inside my trunk/core area wake me up within about an hour.  2. Constant pain coming from my chest, abdomen, and intestines. Intestinal and abdominal pain (gut wrenching, pain/burning sensation, cramps). At times feels like radiation or waves/currents are passing through my intestines/trunk. I wake up with intestines feeling sore. I also have discomfort when I eat or drink something the following morning. Also, my trunk/core area feels tight all day and night. I constantly feel a burning sensation in my chest and gut areas. The discomfort in my chest area (tightness, burning sensation) with occasional burst of pain the size of a nickel that comes from the left side of my chest and underneath my rib cage.  3. Limbs twitch/jerk on their own (both hands, both feet, neck, both shoulders, both legs, fingers) during the day and during the night. tingling sensations in legs.  4. ringing in the ears with headaches. 5. Woke up from sleep due to both nostrils getting clogged while I slept; woke up gasping for air.  6. Penis no longer has the same sensation and difficulty with erection.

                                                On both events, I had stomach cramps that lasted about a week after both shots. The pain went away on its own. In addition, I currently have pain on the arm I received the shot on. This recently started and occurred several weeks after receiving the second dose. The pain is similar to a burn from a sunburn and itches. It varies throughout the day in pain and stretches sometimes from my hand up to the side of my left check. Also on my upper back and back of neck.

                                                Abdominal pain; Diagnosed with Acute Kidney Failure; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, reporting for himself.  A 42-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 13Apr2021 at 10:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing asthma (diagnosed when he was serving around the year 1999-2000). Concomitant medications included albuterol [salbutamol] (ALBUTEROL [SALBUTAMOL]) taken for asthma. In Apr2021, the patient was diagnosed with acute kidney failure, which required physician office visit and emergency room visit. On 14Apr2021, the patient experienced abdominal pain, which required physician office visit and emergency room visit. As reported, he took the vaccine about 3 weeks ago and immediately the next day he had abdominal pain. The patient reported that he stopped everything when he experienced the pain. The pain started mild and then increased and he went to the emergency room. The patient wasn&#39;t admitted to the hospital but after they checked his blood and urine with unknown results, he was given an IV.  When he was released he was told to follow up the next week with his primary care provider. The pain still had not gone away and was in the right side of his abdomen. The pain changed day by day. He had been drinking a lot of water and had maybe 1-2 days where the pain was worse than normal. He had been in and out of the doctor&#39;s office and his kidney levels are a little bit high on an unknown date. Every 2 weeks, blood and urine tests were taken to measure his kidney levels to see how it is doing. CAT scan was performed and did not see anything. The patient reported that something was observed in blood and urine and that&#39;s how an issue with his kidneys was determined. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.   The batch/lot number for the vaccine, btn162b2, was not provided and will be requested during follow up.

He was also feeling hot and complained of feeling a tingling sensation in his fingers. This was a few minutes after the vaccine was given and he was sitting at the post-immunization area. We directed him to sit on the floor and gave him 2 cold packs to put on his neck. Patient looked pale and weak so we also gave him some cold water. After a few minutes of sitting, he asked for us to call 911. We called 911 and alerted management. After paramedics came, patient was taken away. Patient seemed to be doing fine as he was leaving. He regained color in his lips, but was still feeling the other symptoms.

It was so painful that I could not even sit down or lie down without intense discomfort. I was unable to sit for periods longer than 10 minutes. I did not do anything physically demanding after getting the vaccine, so I&#39;m convinced the vacccine caused the pain. I have had lower back soreness for several years and two doctors have diagnosed it as a possible torn disk. It took a full 30 days for the pain to subside.  I also got severe flu-like symptoms from the shot beginning 12 hours after the second shot. These cleared up after about 8 hours.  I also began feeling heart burn about 10 days after my first shot. It intensified after my second shot. I&#39;ve never had heart burn before. I had to go on Omeprazole prescribed by my physisican.  Abo

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

                                                The day after receiving the second vaccination, I began to have mild intermittent abdominal pain2-3/10.  The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

A 43-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number and exp date not reported), intramuscular (vaccine location: left arm) on 28Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. Medical history included gastric sleeve and surgery. The patient had no known allergies. Patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. There was no other medical history. There were no concomitant medications. There were no other vaccine/s within four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The day after patient received the vaccine, she got the common side effects on Jan2021: chills, loose stool, and nausea. She also began having heartburn/indigestion (Jan2021). It had been 16 days since the first dose, and the loose stool and heartburn/indigestion remain. Not sure if it&#39;s because of having the gastric sleeve done years ago, or not, as the surgery changed her metabolism and the like. No treatment was provided. Nasal Swab on 11Jan2021 was negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

                                                Severe spinning, nausea, vomiting, occurred at 2:15 a.m. while on duty, was transported to ER and diagnosed with Peripheral Vertigo. Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

Patient received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine around 17:30 today and states that he developed hives down his left arm and was having difficulty swallowing. He does have a known egg allergy and states that he has had prior anaphylaxis reactions to the flu vaccine. Patient was given PO Benadryl with complete relief of his symptoms. He has no complaints at this time and states that he feels &#34;perfectly fine&#34;. At bedside for initial evaluation. Discussed plan for continued Benadryl throughout tomorrow and follow-up with his PCP. Patient is agreeable. Plan for discharge. The patient is comfortable with further observation of his symptoms at home.  I discussed our workup, answered all questions and made sure there were no other concerns.  I provided counseling about standard home and self-care measures and advised on standard return precautions including new, persistent, or worsening / concerning symptoms.

                                                Upon presentation to Tent 4, participant identified himself as being, &#34;a big baby when it comes to needles&#34;.  Received vaccine to LUE and was waiting in Obs area with son (who reported only being seated for approx 5 mins.).  A loud noise was heard and participant was observed laying out prone on the floor.    Clinicians assisted him to roll over where his eyes were red, wide-open gaze, and diaphoretic but was not responding to commands.  After turning him to his Rgt side he began to sit up and became slightly combative and was able to be calmed down.    Moved to Tent 6 to cot via wheelchair where is RUE BP was 180/100 at 11:09, and Lft radial pulse taken by MD was &#34;60 and weak&#34;, Resp 16 and unlabored so no oxygen in use but nearby.  Upon further assessment, participant repeatedly stated that, &#34;he just did not feel well&#34; and when probed, c/o frontal headache, nauseated (but did not vomit), and weak.  Offered water to sip and by now lip no longer bleeding.  When asked, &#34;what did you feel prior to falling out of your seat?&#34;, he stated, &#34;I just remember that you all were around me asking me questions...hence could not recall moments leading up to being found on the floor and no type of aura was identified as well.  Reported a h/o HTN but did not take his medication today...other history is unremarkable.    Ambulance arrival approx 11:13, VS taken, assessed and transported to nearest facility.  Family returned and later reported that he sustained only a large &#34;goose-egg&#34; on the forehead and fat lip but otherwise was treated and released.

                                                On March 24 I got the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and I experienced side effects almost immediately. By the time I got to the resting/observation area I felt that the site of the injection got really warm and I became dizzy/lightheaded and started to feel heavy on the chest and little problem in swallowing and breathing. I was taken to the paramedics on site, they checked my blood pressure (which a little high 150/90), oxygenation, pulse, and EKG (which were normal). It did not became too bad after and was allowed to come back home.  However, the heavy chest and swallowing problem lasted for three days. The heaviness in the chested turned into a sensation of feeling like my trachea or the anything under the sternum area was behind strangled. Although I felt like this my breathing and swallowing was almost normal. Every now and then when I swallowed I felt some pain but I could withstand it.

                                                Initial soreness at injection site. Approximately 18 hours after injection, nausea, chills, severe headache. No fever. Chills and nausea decreased in severity throughout the next 12 hours but body aches and severe headache persisted. Nothing taken to treat symptoms (no ibuprofen or acetaminophen) In conclusion: initial reaction began 18 hours after injection and lasted approximately 12 hours.

Struggled to get up and down a set of stairs and had to go one at a time including holding the handrail (~43 year old male in very good shape, lifts heavy weights and runs 2-3 miles 3-4 times per week)  .  Managed to fall back asleep and woke up ~2.5 hours later with the same symptoms ,  plus higher fever (102 F) and additionally mild nausea and a very bad headache.    Took Tylenol and upon another 2-3 hour sleep had the fever more managed but dealt with the nausea, headache and aches/pains for the next 24 hours after that.   Symptoms resolved after about 36-48 hours , although I did not feel 100% back to normal until about 72-96 hours after this 2nd dose.

Akin to having a heart attack with a feeling of a die pumped from a CAT scan. Sweating, dizziness, and rapid heart beat. Paramedics on site measured my vitals within 3 minutes and reported pulse over 100, BP at 160/100. This feeling gradually subsided over the next 15 minutes but the chest felt as if it was punched. Day 2 and day 3. Extreme fatigue and uncontrolled Heartburn.  Was unable to quench heartburn that radiated through my neck, face, whole chest. Took 4000 mg of tums and Pepsid 20mg . Heartburn feeling persisted for 5-7 hours both days.

                                                I awoke at approximately 02:00 of the morning following the second dose, in a cold sweat and shivering so hard that I could not move (locked in a fetal position). This lasted about 30 minutes, after which I fell back asleep, exhausted. The next time that I woke up, I was walking into wall between the bedroom and the bathroom (I have no history of sleepwalking). For much of the remainder of the night I experienced multiple episodes of somnambulance, each time awakening when I ran into some object (bathroom counter, television, bookcase). The last time that I woke up, at approximately 07:00, I must have been standing and simply fell over; my head bouncing off the ground is what caused me to wake up. For the entirety of the day after vaccination (04/12/21) I felt as if I had the flu: chills (though no/very mild fever &lt; 99 F) accompanied by shivering, sometimes convulsive; sore muscles; hyperalgesia (light touch perceived as painful); lethargic; strong sense of malaise; loss of appetite. As stated, this lasted for the entire day, through the time that I went to sleep for the night (2300). The next day, 04/13/21 I felt completely back to normal with the exception that some muscles were slightly sore, possibly due to the exercise of an entire day spent shivering.

                                                Left shot clinic after 15 min with no adverse effects.  Driving home mouth and tongue went completely dry instantly and could not swallow.  This was 28 min after initial shot (2nd dose).  Concerned that airway would be restricted.  In a panic went to ER at different hospital that I was near.  No signs of anaphylaxis.  Waited in hospital for ~3 hours.  Symptoms did not get worse and could breath through nose.  Decided no steroid shot (did not want to negate covid shot).  Went home without additional treatment.  Mouth was dry for 1 additional day, but not as extreme as initial dryness.

                                                On the day of the injection, within a few hours I had some mild symptoms like light-headedness (head rush when I stood up), and slight fatigue. It was the next day, more than 24 hours after the injection that symptoms became more intense. At that point I developed a bad headache with moderate nausea, as well as significant fatigue, and a little bit of runny nose. Now it is over 40 hours since the injection and my headache is not as bad, but I still do have a headache and mild fatigue.

                                                Shingles.  I received the second dose of covid vaccine on Wed, April 28. Three days later, Saturday May 1,  I woke up with intense abdominal pain, spanning the entirety of my stomach, and wrapping around my right oblique and kidney area. I had thrown out my back one week prior,  assumed this was more muscle pain, and treated it as such.   The Monday following, May 3, I went to the chiropractor, still in intense pain, but also with a tingling sensation on the affected area, sensitivity to the touch without pain. I assumed that I had burned myself with the heating pad.  Wednesday a rash began to form in the affected area. My pain was nearly gone, I no longer felt muscle tightness, and assumed that the condition was resolving itself, and that the rash was heat rash from the heating pad.   Friday the rash was redder and my abdomen showed signs of significant swelling. I still thought this was muscular, that perhaps I had pulled the abdomen, treated with ice and decided to visit Orthopedic urgent care Saturday.  Saturday the pain had increased. I went to Urgent care, and was told I have shingles. I asked if the covid vaccine could have caused shingles to flare, was told &#34;theoretically&#34;, but thar we do not really know enough to say whether the vaccine contributed, or whether it was coincidence.  At home, I read a bit on the covid vaccine qnd shingles, saw what appeared to be anti-vaccer propaganda, but also read about this self-reporting system...so, I thought that I might as well submit my info.

                                                I had an extremely sore body and couldn?t lift my left arm over my head (I have some should problems anyway, but it made it worse). I had a slight headache, but it wasn?t too bad at that point (maybe about 9:30pm). By 12:30am I was feeling pretty crummy in a general sense and decided to go back to bed (I work nights and normally stay up, even on my nights off). I ended up with severe chills and shivering and shuddering by 1:30am. My legs were so restless and I was shuddering so hard I gave myself charlie horses. By 2:30am I started to warm up but because especially nauseated as I got warmer and warmer. I tried to sleep off and on, but ended up in a chair sitting up and dozing with a bucket in case of getting sick. I was panting heavily for some reason. It felt like it was making the nausea less severe (I also sipped on an Alka-Seltzer and took a meclizine). For three hours I was panting and trying not to vomit. Then I kind of settled down and got an hour or two of sleep, still extremely sore and by this time my head was pounding severely. I got up at 6:30am to take my Mirilax in orange juice (I forgot to mention I take a magnesium supplement and senna on a semiregular basis, as well). The combination of Mg, senna, and OJ didn?t sit well. By about 7:30am I began to get the chills again, but it only lasted about a half hour. Again, an episode of nausea after, but more Alka-Seltzer. I tried to eat small amounts of plain salty tortilla chips, but it didn?t help. It?s now 8:20am and the nausea seems to have passed.

The patient experienced chest pain made him go to the emergency room because it was too much, it was multiple throughout the day not just one time, has had a bad headache where it feels like he has vibrating inside of his head, in his chest and on 31Mar2021, when he falls asleep he wakes up in an hour 31Mar2021, getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping- in his chest and intestines on 31Mar2021, getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping- in his chest and intestines on 31Mar2021, limbs twitch on 31Mar2021, his penis sensations are a lot different. It was reported that 5 days after he got the first dose of the COVID vaccine he started getting pains and the major thing is at night. If he falls asleep, he wakes up in an hour and that has been every night for a month and a half. That is the main thing that is pissing him off. He confirms that he is having issues with his chest and his intestines like he mentioned previously and he has started keeping track and has kept a journal of the pains. This stuff is new. He has never experienced this before and it has been happening every day starting 5 days after when he got the COVID vaccine. He had the COVID vaccine on 27Mar2021 and on 31Mar2021 he got the first shock in his chest at 0120 in the morning when he was sleeping. Then that went on for a week, he had it on 31Mar2021, 01Apr2021, 02Apr2021, 03Apr2021 and 04Apr2021 where he was getting shocked in the middle of the night when he is sleeping. On 04Apr2021 he had to go to the emergency room and have them look at him. But since 31Mar2021 he has been getting up every hour after he falls asleep. This was all worse when it first started because he has never experienced anything like this. The first shock he had was a hard feeling in his chest and then he couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. It is so bad. After he went to the emergency room, that is when it started being not as much of a shock pain that woke him up but he was still waking up every hour. The pains are in his upper chest and in his intestines. Also his limbs twitch and he has had a bad headache where it feels like he has vibrating inside of his head, in his chest and in his abdomen. He confirmed that these also began on 31Mar2021 and have been happening whenever they want and he has never experienced all of that before. Never. Everything has all stayed the same. The sad part is that he just thinks that he is getting used to this &#34;new normal&#34; because he is now going on the second month of this and his body is adapting but this is not normal. Also, he guesses that he shouldn&#39;t be shy now but the last thing is that his penis sensations are a lot different and he didn&#39;t notice until the first time that he was having relations with his wife after the COVID vaccine and it is all different. He noticed and she did too as far as whenever they were trying to have relations. It has been more than once, it has been every time they have tried afterwards. He says his doctor is going to send him to a sleep lab but he wasn&#39;t expecting that. He thought that maybe he would need to go somewhere else. But there he will go to sleep and be hooked up and they will read his whole body and tell the reason why he is waking up every hour. The outcome of the event headache, sleep disorder, chest discomfort, muscle twitching was not recovered and penis order, headache was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                With my 1st vaccine I just had soreness around the injection site. After the 2nd vaccine I woke up at 4am on 1/31/2021 with muffled hearing in my left ear and mild numbness in the entire left side of my body from top of my head to bottom of my feet. I experienced vomiting and diarrhea also. I had blood pressure of 150 /105 and pulse rate of 100. My doctor was afraid I had a stroke, so I went to the ER and had a CT scan in brain. I tried to go to work the next day but my head was foggy so I had to leave work. I had a test for carotid arteries and heart test that came back fine. I was sent to a neurologist. He suspected I had possible swelling in the spinal cord, but since I was feeling a little better he thought it was ok to wait to have a spinal tap. He described that the symptoms were MS dialed symptoms but did not feel I had MS. I&#39;ve gotten better but continue to have a neuropathy pain in my left foot, left hand, and left side of my face. It tends to get worse at night but in the morning it is ok. It continues through the day. None of these symptoms were there before the vaccine.

                                                Little muscle twitches; felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines; Low grade fever; Muscle soreness; Muscle tiredness; Hands were a little shaky; Very diaphoretic; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other Nurse. This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                I have had fever, chills, body aches, congestion, headaches, slight nausea, loss of appetite, almost every day since the injection.  I sleep at night, and wake up around 2am with sever chills, take 800mg Ibuprofen, and within an hour my chills break and I start feeling better.  The process repeats itself in the afternoon and then again in the evening.  I&#39;m constantly tired and fatigued, and have been unable to exercise or work out since.   I&#39;m still experiencing the symptoms as of today.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

He requested water and as I was giving it to him he started to pass out.  He was conscious but slightly convulsing.  He appeared to have a minor seizure for approximately 5-10 seconds.  He was transferred to a wheelchair and sent into our recovery room.  As we were transporting him, he had two episodes of vomiting and continued to feel diaphoretic and weak.  He rested laying down but was not feeling better.  He could not tolerate any water or juice.

Difficulty maintaining balance (like walking while drunk only I don&#39;t drink anymore) NO nausea/spinning just balance.

                                                This is sharing a concern / reporting a concern. This is not a complaint against anyone. This is not reporting side effect. The adverse effect date and time is a mandatory field. This is the reason I filled adverse date and time. I had my 2nd dose of vaccine on April 25, 2021 at campus at 1.20 PM. I just felt the syringe just touched the peripheral of my skin. I told the nurse that I do not feel I get the shot. Later, I do not feel any side effect any effect. I had no pain, or the site of injection was not swollen. I am worried I did not get the 0.3ml dose. During the first shot on April 4, 2021 at 1.43 PM, I felt pain on shoulders. I felt my tongue got thickened/ some tingling sensation on tongue and a little slur in speech. After 6 hours, I felt headache, a little chill, light head, nausea, more pain on shoulders and the next day, I felt light headedness and I felt tired for few days. I consider these as normal side effects and nothing unusual from what I read in internet and what I heard from others. So, I did not report it and it was a normal thing for me. Since I experienced this in first dose, I expected a more severe reaction than first dose. But I did not even feel pain at the site of injection nor any usual symptoms that usually appear. This made me to doubt I got required dose or the vaccine was correctly withdrawn from the vile. I do not know how to confirm that I got correct dosage. If I have not received the full dose, I am ready to take an additional shot and I would be flexible to take the shot at the available time near to my living place on any day.  Again, I am not complaining anything. Probably the nurse is very proficient in taking shot with no pain. I do not know why my body does not react to the second dose.

                                                Severe body ache, chills, sweating, nausea, and vomiting. Vomited 9 times in a row and spent the entire night with a bucket.  For the next week every morning, diarrhea and unsettled stomach, lack of energy, excessive sleep, no ability to exercise without severe fatigue or a return of digestive problems. This lasted a week. Sexual activity also impossible, erection quality greatly reduced. Many of these symptoms got better but have now returned with my second dose. Second dose has given me significant fatigue, digestive problems again, diarrhea, and reduced erection quality once more. I hope these problems resolve themselves. The vaccine has made going to work very difficult and I will seriously reconsider taking any vaccine in the future.

                                                Client came to vaccination site at 1715 for his 2nd Pfizer dose on 06/13/21.  After being seated with RN, he expressed concern about receiving his 2nd dose due to the reactions he experienced after receiving his 1st dose.  RN requested Lead RN speak with the client regarding his concerns.  At 1720 Lead RN spoke to client.  Client stated that 1 ½ days after getting his 1st dose, he experienced soreness &amp; tenderness in the axillary area of the left arm.  Client stated that 3 days later his axillary area began swelling.  The swelling continued below his axillary down the left side of his abdomen and onto the left side of his back.  Client stated the pain level was a 4 on a scale of 0-10.  He also stated there was no discoloration or redness in any of the areas where he experienced swelling.  On day 10 the left side of the client?s neck began to swell.  He also started to experience discomfort at the injection site and arm fatigue.  Client stated at no time did he experience any trouble breathing, shortness of breath, or chest pain.  Client stated he has been dieting and lost 145 lbs. in the last year.  He previously had high blood pressure, but no longer does.  He also stated the only other underlying conditions he has is a thyroid problem (hypothyroidism), and he is not medication compliant.  Over the last 6 months he has only taken his levothyroxine intermittently.  In the last 2 months he has not taken any of his levothyroxine until a few days ago.  Client takes no other medication, but is allergic to penicillin-based antibiotics.  Client stated he gets dizzy, hallucinates, and swells up in various places on his body.  However, he does not experience shortness of breath or trouble breathing.  Client did not take any medication for the side effects he experienced after receiving his first Pfizer injection or seek medical treatment.  Client stated all the swelling began to subside on day 17.  Lead RN performed a medical consult with Clinical Care Coordinator who authorized moving forward with administering client a Pfizer 2nd dose in the opposite arm with a 30-minute observation.  Prior to RN administering vaccine, Lead RN educated client on normal vs adverse effects of the vaccine.  Lead RN confirmed with client that he has access to a HCP for follow-up, if needed.  Lead RN also recommended client follow-up with his HCP regarding his hyperthyroid condition.  Lead RN instructed client to seek emergency care if he experienced shortness of breath, trouble breathing, or chest pain at any time after leaving the vaccination facility.

It varies in intensity, it is generally the worst in the morning and evening or at least I block it out enough to do my job. Pain is in the back of my head/upper neck, in front of my ears on the sides of my head, sometimes I also get it on the crown of  my head. I have also been nauseous pretty much every day since then. I have vomited once. Nausea is worst in the mornings. Occasionally I feel like I have a concussion, hard to describe that feeling.

                                                While on duty and in uniform as an emergency paramedic I received my second  scheduled covid19 vaccination.  Approximately five minutes after receiving  C19 dose 2 vaccination (1335hrs). I experienced a syncopal episode while walking back to my work area and was lowered to the ground by another EMS provider. I was then placed in a wheelchair by the  EMS provider and an RN and taken to the emergency department at Medical Center. (1337hrs)  I  regained alertness and felt severe nausea and general weakness and was assisted into in ER bed.  Staff doctor attended along with RN . An assessment was completed, 12 lead EKG completed, IV established, 8mg Zofran administered, 1000ml of Normal Saline was bolused. Labs were drawn.  ED staff continued to monitor me for the next  2 plus hours I was monitored for anaphylaxis and other symptoms. My symptoms of nausea mostly resolved and my strength returned.  A Resident MD completed a final evaluation and determined it was safe for me to be discharged. (1607hrs)

The rest of me felt like I had a mild case of the flu.  Aches and fatigue all over, with some chills.   I have been training for a half marathon, and this through off my training due to knee pain.    I also had diarrhea that has lasted through Saturday.   The first day after was the worst, and things have improved each day since.

A 45-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL6269), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 04Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 45-years-old) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. 51 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting down watching a film. His left arm began to tingle, and he felt a wave of dizziness and nausea come over him. He stood up, walked a few steps and sat back down. He broke out in a cold sweat, chills, and saw stars. He leaned forward with his head in his hands, and apparently fainted for a moment and lost control of his bladder. All events started on 06Feb2021 06:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. No covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

However, the atypical AEs included daily and persistent dizziness, &#34;brain fog&#34;, fatigue, difficulty going up the stairs without getting winded (difficulty with physical exertion).  These symptoms are still present on March 31st (11 days post injection).  GI / diarrhea symptoms are also present.  Of note, I did have COVID in the past (January 2021) - and had similar symptoms that had resolved at the time of the vaccine.  These symptoms are severe enough that it may prevent the second shot (due to concerns of worsening AEs or prolonged events).  Of note, the fatigue was worse with the actual disease vs. the vaccine.

                                                Within 3 minutes of receiving vaccine I had Instant fever, nausea, arm pain, face and lips numb, dizziness, blood pressure low, chills. The pharmacy had to call 911 for a paramedic. I&#39;m still feeling symptoms almost 24hrs later. I chose not to go to hospital in ambulance.

                                                Within 60 seconds of receiving the injection, I experienced moderate breathing difficulty.   After 10-20 minutes, I noticed that my throat felt slightly swollen (slight difficulty swallowing).  Due to a hyperallergic event that occurred about 12 years ago, I occasionally run into something that triggers the respiratory effect  - although usually the reaction is milder than that caused by the vaccine.  However, the throat swelling is new.  I took a single puff of an Albuterol inhaler around 5 minutes after the injection,  but it had no effect (usually the case for me when the cause is allergic in nature).  About 37 minutes after the injection, medical staff advised me to take an antihistamine.  I took approximately 6 mg of doxylamine succinate (orally).  However, by this point, the breathing had already started to ease slightly.  Approximately 30 minutes later, my breathing was back to normal and the throat inflamation was gone.  It&#39;s uncertain how much of that would have occurred through time alone and how much of it was the antihistamine starting to take effect.  My BP was very high when measured during treatment.  Partially explained by the albuterol inhaler combined with pseudoephedrine taken earlier in the day, along with anxiety and exertion from the event itself.

Unable to stand, had to crawl to nearby chair and call for wife. Thought might be dehydrated, extremely pale, tried to drink water, but began vomiting. BP was elevated, but no temperature. Tried to eat crackers and drink more water, but continued to violently vomit. Never felt so badly in entire life. No strength to stand or get up the stairs to be taken to ER, so had to call paramedics. When they arrived, BP had come down, but they felt needed to be transported to ER, so they took to healthcare facility at about 1:30 pm.

Thinks he may have passed out (does not know how long) and woke up with vomit all over him.  Thinks he may have had a seizure as his neck was stiff and had bite marks on his tongue.  As of 4/23/2021 Subject reports full recovery.  Has passed out before after having blood drawn x 2 in the past, but not shots.

There are well defined &#39;side effects&#39; that are notable. Overall feeling after the vaccine is unwell. (Nothing like the side effects for say the flu virus)  The side effects are much more pronounced. The side effect that is/was most notable is fatigue and drowsiness. I&#39;ve felt unusually fatigued and sleepy over the past few days with the severest fatigue occurring the day after taking the vaccine. (I&#39;ve felt fatigue like symptoms over the past few days since taking the vaccine on 4/22.)

                                                When I woke up the day after (Day #2) being given the vaccine I was extremely tired exhausted, I had intense chills and hot flashes. Never a fever. I felt nauseated. Completely lethargic. Muscle aches all over my body, was hard to move. I couldn&#39;t stay awake. My eyes hurt. I had intense migraines.  And no appetite. My right arm hurt, but not as bad as many others&#39; reported.  I took ibuprofen to help, it didn&#39;t. I drank lots of water and gatorade zero for the electrolytes. It didn&#39;t help either.  On day #3, this was when it got scary. The previous  symptoms carried over, minus the nausea and I was able to be mobile (less lethargic).  But something new started to happen. I took my dog out for a short walk, a slow pace, I am very athletic, and I had shortness of breath. I was winded from just walking slowly. Then the brain fog started to set in. This I hated the most. I wasn&#39;t able to comprehend things. I tried to assemble an item I bought from Amazon and it was extremely hard to follow simple instructions. I wasn&#39;t able to see clearly for some reason. And even comprehending emails that I was receiving was troublesome. I kept drinking water, and was able to eat a little. Had two more bottles of Gatorade Zero.  On day 3, most of all the symptoms subsided except that I still got winded from movement.  On day 4, I was fine.

A 45 years old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0150) in left shoulder (arm) on 08Apr2021 14:45 at age of 45 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. No medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) reported. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. There was no adverse event (AEs) following prior vaccinations, this is the first he can ever recall. There was no family Medical History patient can think of. Patient knew his Dad got the Covid-19 second dose about the same time patient got his first shot Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine and his Dad was not doing so well. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Concomitant medications were not reported. Patient was a consumer reporting he received the first dose Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine last Thursday in his left shoulder was calling about his side effects. Patient stated his arm was sore for a couple of days. Patient confirmed it was his left arm that was sore. Reports this arm soreness was still ongoing.

By starting Saturday, patient was so fatigued and so tired, reported he could not stay awake. Then yesterday the patient was so tired and went for a walk for a few hours. Patient was still extremely exhausted. Reports tiredness is ongoing today. Patient still felt exhausted and did not get out of bed until 14:00, just seems ongoing.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

A 45-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; /Lot Number: ER2613), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 04Apr2021 (at the age of 45-years-old) at 14:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID: he had gotten diagnosed with COVID back in December or January and twice tested positive for covid and his body had fought it off (as reported). Medical history included also back pain Concomitant medication included diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) taken to sleep, start and stop date were not reported. The patient reported that around the night of vaccination he experienced cold sweat, headache, and cramping for several hours then subside and come back later. Patient had some bumps appear on the side of his neck. He stated that he could not say that&#39;s from the shot, something may have bit him. The patient did bump his head a chandelier and went to the ER. He received Ibuprofen for the symptoms. Patient stated that the reported events occurred the same day as his COVID Vaccine and began a couple of hours later and wakes up every night in a cold sweat; stated he was in and out of the emergency room in about an hour and they gave him Ibuprofen  400mg and a of nights had to take two Ibuprofen because his head and body was hurting so bad and he had to take some kind of relief and he does not like taking stuff like that and pain pills make his stomach hurt. Patient stated he did a whole Ibuprofen and did not feel good after that and can&#39;t take the Ibuprofen anymore and then took 1-2 Aleve after that and does not like taking pain medication. He stated he was healing with the bumps but had this every day since the Pfizer Vaccine and he was starting to heal but the bumps were still there on the side of his neck and were improving and healing and he had the bumps on his head that were also painful; states the bumps occurred the same day as his Pfizer COVID Vaccine; states he was up in his attic and could have gotten into a spider nest and might have poison in him from the spiders and then went to the hospital emergency room with these issues. States he told the emergency room about the bites and bumps and that he had the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and they gave him the Ibuprofen and sent him home. The patient stated that this was a real concern for him due to the blood clots stuff coming out about how people have different reactions after a vaccine. States he felt like the hospital did not even do anything; he could have hit his head a couple of times on a chandelier; states the emergency took an image of his head and they did not address the bumps or anything else and said his head was not bleeding and gave him Ibuprofen and he did not think you should take Ibuprofen like when you have COVID and they sent him home and nothing was done. Caller states he does not know but when he received the Pfizer COVID vaccine he noticed a patch of bumps in his neck, and his neck got really tight and his neck still hurts on the left side; states he could have gotten bitten by something. The patient reported that after he had the Pfizer COVID vaccine, he was waking up every night with cold sweats, and recently last night had extreme cramps in his stomach area like was crawling around the floor getting away from the pain and is still having abdominal cramps. He ate a burger and had extreme cramps and diarrhea for days and this was after his Pfizer COVID vaccine and he is doing this again with stomach cramps and diarrhea; he can&#39;t distinguish what the cramps and diarrhea were from and maybe he ate something bad and is confused about his body; states the cramps are way worse and the diarrhea began after the burger. States the diarrhea is a lot and this time is less diarrhea but more abdominal cramps and he threw up several times last night and did not throw up a lot but was so nauseous and threw up twice a little bit. Patient stated that the reported events were just like when he had covid and after waking up at 12:00 he had body pains and was not able to go back to sleep until 4:00; states he had pretty bad headaches which are ongoing and had had headaches ever since he was diagnosed with COVID, stated it is the same thing also as when he had covid; states with covid he got sick and was up from 12:00 4:00 and had fatigue, had body pain, had headaches and nausea and then it got better and he started sleeping through the night. States the Pfizer COVID shot and it was like the same all over again where he was up from 12:00 4:00, had pain and was disorientated, just not feeling good at all which has gone on since the shot; states there were two nights where he slept through the night and was up in a cold sweat which wakes him up and drenches him head to toe and he has to get out of bed to change clothes and sit there til he is tired again and sometimes goes to sleep in the chair and then sleeps ok. Patient stated he took Benadryl just to sleep through the night and did not and got up once and then went back to sleep. He stated on the left side where the headaches were and he had neck pain and it was kind of the left side and felt weird. The patient stated also that in the emergency room he was given Valium in his arm and also has a knot on the back of his neck and tried to address it with the emergency room and they said it was a spasm and did not seem concerned and it felt hard and not a bump under his skin in his neck and it just felt like maybe a pea sized hard knot and noticed this after his Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Caller stated he actually felt pretty good and was sleeping through the night after he had COVID and felt back to normal and then after his Pfizer COVID vaccine everything went downhill. The outcome of events was unknown.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Woke up on 4th day after vaccine (May 5, 2021) with pain in calf. Swelling continued to get worse. Went to an emergency room just over one week after vaccine (May 8, 2021) and was diagnosed with DVT in the lower left calf (after D Dimer test and ultrasound). No family history of clotting issues. And no personal history of clotting issues. Currently on Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), 15 mg twice per day. Will be on for at least 3 months (moving to 20 mg once per day after the first 21 days).

A 45-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: Aug2021, NDC number: unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 19May2021 at 13:00 as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included sinus infection in 2011 (for which he visited a doctor 10 years ago to get an antibiotic). Other than that, he was healthy. Patient had no family history. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8735; Expiration Date: 31Jul2021) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 28Apr2021 13:00 as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Patient had no problems after first dose. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. 6 hours after vaccine, the left side blew up. About 12 hours after the second shot in the middle of the night, patient had the initial reaction and pretty normal side effects (little nausea and fever). Patient had a lymph node inflammation/swelling, which was severe on his left side including his arm pit, down his side, even down into his groin. The reaction died down after about 2 days but spread to rest of the body. On 28May2021, Friday of last week (about 10 days later), everything just blew up. Every one of his lymph nodes went crazy. So many were down in his groin area, the lymph nodes blew up so badly. It was putting enough pressure in that region, it was cutting off circulation to his manhood. Patient had to go to the hospital around 1:00AM. Patient was diagnosed finally at 04:56 and clarified it to be an emergency room visit. Patient was seen in the ER for about 3-4 hours. He was never actually admitted into the hospital. ER doctor believed that patient had a hernia due to the swelling in the lower abdomen. Patient did not know all the tests that were done in the ER. When patient mentioned the swelling that cut off the circulation to manhood, the ER doctor had them ultrasound his manhood, but the doctor never actually listened to the patient. The doctor basically did not want to hear that there were any problems with the vaccine. Patient felt that administration led to lymph node reaction. Instead of sitting in arm for a couple of days or going into a fatty or muscle tissue, vaccine went into the lymph system and now his lymph system was going crazy. He believed this one time when the person jabbed the COVID vaccine in and squeezed the plunger, it put the product right into a lymph node and all of it right into the lymph system. Patient never had a lymph node problem. Patient still had severe lymph node problems. Patient was getting lymphedema in some areas. The only reaction that was abnormal was the extreme lymph node swelling. Outcome of the events was unknown. Investigation Assessment: Yes

                                                Possible symptom 1: Within approximately a day or two of the shot, I developed a severe and persistent lower abdominal/groin pain.  The pain was very pin point in location and lasted for approximately 10 days before easing up.  Very small isolated pain severe enough to go to the DR, but I could not afford to on account of my wife having severe unknown abdominal pain and being in the ER and DR  multiple times herself (she got the same vaccine an hour before me?).  Possible symptom 2:  4-5 days after the shot I developed an isolated and severe pain in a preexisting nodule/mass (lymph node?) located on my mid right thigh, it has never had any sensation before.  The pain was persistently severe for approximately 7 days before easing up.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination.

They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date with sequelae (recovered with lasting effects).

My stomach has been in constant pain.  I?ve also had a slight fever and a very sore arm.  Tylenol and rest has worked for the fever and arm, and I&#39;ve had some addition body aches.  Not sure how much is due to being in bed for an extended period.  Also on Friday (about 24 hrs after getting the shot I was pretty fatigued.  I just woke up from 13 hours of sleeping.  But the stomach cramps/pains was severe and prompted me to try to find a way to report it, especially since it doesn&#39;t seem to be too common.  It&#39;s been really bad.

I was vomiting with intense force but nothing was coming up. My abdomen was bloated to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand upright and breathing was very painful. I was in that condition for about 12 hours before the swelling began to lessen. Now, 2 days later, I am still unable to eat and drink as normal and have moderate gastrointestinal discomfort with bloating.

Woke the next morning feeling better. Still some light nausea. Had diarrhea though. But when using the bathroom  only a small amount would come out and it was mostly bile. That was all day yesterday (Saturday). No solid BM?s at all. Today I?m kind of constipated. When I feel the urge for a BM it?s little bile wrapped pellets. Def not my normal BM....  so, I haven?t had a solid, relieving BM   Since Friday and I?m starting to feel bloated. Hopefully this will work itself through.

A 46-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: unknown; Expiration Date: unknown), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 04Feb2021 15:45 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included learning disability (found out last March he has a genetic disability, MECP2, which is a gene that carries Rhett&#39;s, autism, and Asperger&#39;s), rectal hemorrhage, fecaloma. The patient previously took Lipitor and experienced blood creatine phosphokinase increased, Aricept (2 doses, 1 in am and 1 in pm) and experienced gait inability and rhabdomyolysis, simvastatin (20mg for years and that was discontinued back in Jan or Feb of 2020), atorvastatin and experienced rhabdomyolysis and coumadin and experienced atrial fibrillation. Concomitant medications was not reported. Around Apr or Mar of 2020, the patient was hospitalized, and his creatinine kinase level was about 6000 and got better and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. The creatinine kinase level on 16Jun2020 was 131 and on 17Dec2020 his creatinine kinase total level was 56 and that the range is 44-196. After receiving the first dose of vaccine, the patient wasn&#39;t feeling well, he reportedly has at baseline of being unable to articulate how he feels due to depressed ability to speak, but &#34;he began talking to himself, had nausea and wasn&#39;t feeling well&#34;. So they took him to the doctor and had labs drawn on 12Feb2021 which showed elevated creatinine kinase levels measuring 1,019. They were instructed to speak to a rheumatologist and got another level on 22Feb which came back as 66. The pharmacist reported that back in Dec2020, the patient&#39;s kinase level was 55.  Kinase was 1015 (blood creatine phosphokinase increased) on 12Feb2021, feeling unwell, nausea, unable to articulate how he feels due to depressed ability to speak, panic, anxiety in 2021. The pharmacist reported that he was told by the physician that it is possible the COVID vaccine is not safe. They were instructed to speak to a Rheumatologist and got another level on 22Feb which came back as 66. The patient&#39;s appointment is the same day as COVID vaccine, 28Feb2021. The patient is scheduled to receive his second dose of the vaccine this Thursday and he asked if it is safe to receive the second dose of the vaccine after reacting to the first. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood creatine phosphokinase: 6000 on 2020, 131 on 16Jun2020, 55 on Dec2020, 56 on 17Dec2020, 1015 on 12Feb2021, 1019 on 13Feb2021, 66 on 22Feb2021, magnetic resonance imaging: diagnosed with MECP2 on 12Feb2021, weight: 180-190 lbs, weight: 141-142 lbs, weight: 140.2 or 140.8 lbs on 12Feb2021. The reporter assessed the events to be non-serious. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/Batch requested.

I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

I ate dinner and got ready for bed.  But then, starting 12 hours after my shot, starting at 11:00 pm, I began to have severe chills and total body shakes.  I was curled up into a ball under blanket, both freezing cold and profusely sweating.  My breathing was very fast and I couldn&#39;t slow it down.  My stomach was very upset and I was unable to eat anything.  At 3:30 am, I got a severe Migraine which lasted until 6:00 am.  I continued to feel very ill the whole rest of the day.  Finally, around 9:00 am some 34 hours after syptoms began, they left me.

                                                Patient is a 46 year old male who admitted to hospital for Facial nerve palsy. Patient felt with left sided facial droop and tingling sensation for 2 days. He reported symptoms onset at 1330 on 6/10/2021 while driving a truck. He also had left sided occipital headache and rested for 1 hour. His symptoms improved after the nap but never resolved completely. He got into a location and rested there for 1 night. In the morning after waking up he was having difficulty chewing food on his left side. He called EMS and was brought to hospital. While in the ED, he received workup including CT Head W/O, CTA Head/Neck with perfusion scan that were all negative. Other labs obtained included BMP, CBC, Troponin x1, Coag studies &amp; CXR which were largely unremarkable. Neurology were called for stroke alert and given ASA 325mg and ordered MRI. Patient&#39;s MRI was unremarkable for stroke or masses. He was started on Prednisone 40mg once daily for Facial Nerve Palsy. He was seen by physical therapy and occupational therapy, they recommended him go home to family. His symptoms improved after therapies were initiated but are not completely resolved. Patient will continue taking his home medications per his primary care doctor. He will complete a 7 day steroid course, has 3 days remaining. He will take Acyclovir 5 times per day for 10 days. We also gave him lubricating eye drops since he continues to have difficulty closing his left eye.  He spends a lot of time outdoors and works with horses. He reports getting tick bites before in his body but never noticed a rashes. He has never received treatment for Lyme Disease. He is a long-haul truck driver and has driven all around. He reports walking in wooded areas when he stops in the rest area. We obtained Lyme Titers, which were eqivocal for IgM and negative for IgG. Western blot was ordered to rule out Lyme disease. He should followup with PCP for treatment if he is positive. We will call him with results when available.   Of note he received Pfizer 2nd COVID vaccine on 6/9/21 (LOT #EW0178). He reported fever and diarrhea that night and next morning. He then reports having presenting symptoms after 7 hours of driving.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

First experience with shingles  Had chicken pox when I was a toddler Ramsey Hunt syndrome 2 was diagnosis Got second shot as scheduled shingles rash was clearing and pain was beginning to subside at the time.  Two days after second shot pain from shingles increased and new vesicles formed. Second rash has been less severe than first so far but pain is equal to that at the time of the first rash.

Waited 20-40 more minutes, then felt dizzy and began to have hives in addition to previous reactions. I went to Urgent Care where they took vitals. Blood pressure and heart rate were elevated, throat was abnormal, and I had hives. They gave me antihistamine and steroid shot.  After 30minutes - and hours, vitals returned to normal.

ADEM suspected and extensive infectious, inflammatory and neoplastic workup was initiated. CT brain  - reported NAD MRI brain consistent with Acute Diffused Encephalomyelitis and suspected ADEM. MRI cervical spine with evidence of demyelination involving posterior cord. ICU course complicated by new onset of aphasia, partial left frontotemporal seizures, LGIB due to proximal rectal laceration and central diabetes insipidus.  Admitted 3/15/21.  On 3/17 he developed aphasia with right sided facial droop and stroke alert was called. Later on 3/17 he developed GI bleeding and was taken for emergent colonoscopy, from which no significant conclusions could be made due to lack of preparation and subsequent poor visualization. No foreign body was reported. After he continued to have ongoing bleeding, the patient had a sigmoidoscopy, during which the migrated clip could be removed and two new hemostatic clips were placed.  He subsequently developed large volume urine output and nephrology was consulted; the patient was diagnosed with likely diabetes insipidus.  On 3/20 acyclovir was discontinued after HSV PCR was negative. High dose solumedrol for ADEM completed 5 day course 3/21.  VDRL was non reactive. There were no oligoclonal bands. Solumedrol 1g daily was started 3/24/21: MRI showed L&gt;R patchy enhancement and diffusion abnormalities consistent with ADEM. Repeat MRI showed new restricted diffusion of the left superior cortex, bilateral medial temporal lobes and hippocampi, genu of the corpus collosum, and pericallosal white matter, with ddx including status epilepticus, autoimmune encephalitis and infectious encephalitis including herpes simplex.  Completed 5 day course of high dose steroids, 6 days of IVIG and on ongoing PLEX. Neurological improvement noted 3/25

                                                Got my first Pfizer shot on March 24 at 2 pm. The first day I felt way off like I was drunk or on some kind of drug that gets you high with bouts of dizziness and some major hypertension. My back and chest were very tight the whole time. The tension finally subsided around 11 pm that night but I was still uneasy. The 2nd day I felt ok in the morning and throughout the day until about 3 or 4 pm I started getting really nauseated and tired. I went to lay down to sleep and felt a little better when I woke an hour later. Day 3 I started feeling extremely tired and fatigued with some major chills. Basically slept most of that evening and throughout the night. Woke that next day and couldn&#39;t get that dizzy foggy feeling out of my head the whole day. Day 4-5 still bouts of dizziness, chills and fatigue with some nausea also I noticed I developed a wheezing dry cough which points towards respiratory distress. Day 6 still feeling yucky, tired, fatigued, some nausea and that dam cough. Today  03-31-21, still feeling weak and tired with some episodes of dizzy spells, nausea and respiratory distress cough.   Also forgot to mention on day 2 and 3 I had some major tingling on the right side of my head for most of the day. Felt like spiders crawling on my head and face. The last time I felt tingling like that I got shingles which also got me very sick and put me in the ER and ICU years ago. So there is also some post traumatic stress from that as well.  Made an appointment to see a Doctor on 03-30-21 to have my blood pressure checked and get an overall check up.  My blood pressure is elevated and stress levels are high with anxiety.  Dr prescribed me some anxiety medication. No other recommendations from the Doctor.

He presented to the emergency room with the a several day history of fluctuating blood pressure and nausea/vomiting and generally feeling very poorly.  He has been having a lot of new onset health issues lately and so his wife and family were concerned.  He was brought into the emergency room.  He denies any severe abdominal pain.  However, he states he has been feeling extremely nauseous.  He is vomited at least once a day for the last 5 days.  He does admit that he is under an extraordinary amount of stress between his new onset Parkinson&#39;s, his insurance business, and his full-time job as a pastor.  The patient also does have a history of alpha-gal allergy.  He states it is possible he ate some cross contaminated meat, but states that this nausea and vomiting does not act like his typical response to eating something that he is allergic to.   The patient states that about a month and a half his neurologist did increase his Requip up from 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 1.5 mg 3 times per day.  However, it has never made him nauseous before.  He denies any definite chest pain.  He denies any exertional dyspnea.  He does admit that his blood pressure has been fluctuating for quite some time.  He states he was having a skin biopsy done last week and they almost abandon the procedure because his blood pressure was so high.  He currently takes a combination of Benicar and hydrochlorothiazide.   In the emergency room his lipase was found to be a little bit elevated.  Creatinine was found to be a little bit elevated.  His blood pressure was very elevated in the systolic 170 range and he did require some IV labetalol.  The patient states he really has not missed any doses of his medications.

A 47-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH mRNA COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), dose 1 other, via an unspecified route of administration, (Batch/Lot Number was not provided) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history includes Chron&#39;s. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that Patient had colonoscopy about 6-7 weeks prior to the Pfizer Covid vaccine. After receiving his first Pfizer Covid vaccine he experienced abdominal pain &amp; feeling bloated. Caller went to the ED and had a CT scan which showed a larger amount of air in the abdominal area, that wasn&#39;t there during the colonoscopy. Outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                Within two weeks of the first Pfizer shot, I experienced significant joint pain in both shoulders, and more disconcertingly, significant pain and locking of the right knee. It continues today, though somewhat reduced in intensity. I assumed there was some significant structural issue with the knee, but an MRI indicates there is not. Furthermore, I have experienced pain on a periumbilical hernia, which I have had my entire life, but never experienced any pain from until approximately 2 weeks after the first vaccine dose. I can provide more detail if requested. To be clear, I don&#39;t know that any of this is causally connected to the COVID vaccine, but it is at least correlated, and these medical symptoms I have had are unprecedented and thus far unexplained.

                                                Heart Attack. A feeling of burning in my arms and mouth of the stomach, in addition to fatigue when walking, started on June 12, 2021. I never had such pain before and thought it&#39;s just a stomach virus or so. As the pain continues, I called my primary-care Dr. early morning of June 17 and scheduled appointment for a week later. But around 9:30 pm that day, June 17, the pain became so severe, in addition to nausea and shortness of breath. I went to emergency room and have been told that there is acute heart attack in progress and was moved to the Critical Care Unit in the Heart and Vascular Center. A blockage has been removed and a stent was installed in morning of June 18, through heart catheterization procedure. As there was damage to the heart muscle due to the heart attack, I am supposed to go back later, in 4-6 weeks, to remove couple more blockages and install stents.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

But every time I was stable and tried to use it again I felt pain again. Pain was always there - it was tolerable. I was told to take Ibuprofen about three hours later. Second day,  I could feel it but I didn&#39;t take medication. It slowly went away. No swelling, nothing. On January 4th started having symptoms nose bleeding; diarrhea; cold sweats; had a fever - but I didn&#39;t take it to know what it was. I very tired/ extremely sleepy; my eyes started feeling warm- these symptoms creeped up on me. It started around 10:00 am and within an hour an a half I had to tell my boss and they told me to leave work - but I couldn&#39;t drive. I stayed in my car and just slept and I was extremely tired. I had a coworker keep an eye on my because I looked really bad. I slept two or three hours in my car. I was still tired and I couldn&#39;t drive yet. So I stayed in my car a little longer until I felt stronger and drove home. I had started coughing and knocked out - but I was beginning to coughing a lot  on drive home- the  first hour I couldn&#39;t sleep because I was coughing so much - lasted an hour. Chest coldness for a couple of days - cold chest. It wasn&#39;t tight. Next day,  January 5, 2021 - went to doctor and they ordered COVID test. Dr thought I had a stomach virus. Diarrhea continued for two days. Weak and fatigue for 5 days. My Fever - temperature was on the first day was one day only. Second day, I did have a lot of fatigue and I was coughing a lot.  The fatigue lasted 10 days.

                                                The morning after the first dose (taken on 1/20/2021) I threw up and have felt dizzy/nauseous frequently. The throwing up only happened that morning but the dizziness continued. The dizziness happened when I turned my head to quickly or bent over.   After the second dose (taken at 2:30pm on 2/11/2021) I have dry heaved nearly every morning since. I&#39;m not throwing up anything but the dry heaving happens nearly every morning and continues to even today (3/2/2021). I don&#39;t feel nauseous even though I dry heave... which seems strange. I still feel like I have vertigo, which I did not have prior to taking the COVID19 vaccine.

                                                I had no issues before the shot.  After I took the shot, I developed a rash on my stomach the next day. I did not pay attention and I thought it was the rash they were talking about.   It started to hurt the next day and was still red and not getting better.  I went to urgent care and I told them that I took the COVID-19 shot.  They said that I had shingles.

                                                Beginning about 10 hours after the shot, I experienced, extreme fatigue with body and muscle aches and a low-grade fever.  As the day progressed I developed a terrible, splitting headache, much like a migraine, which I do not normally get.  The fever subsided, but the body aches, fatigue and headache continued all day long. Just as the headache was subsiding, I developed a terrible, painful case of heart burn due most likely to not eating much during the day.   I could not lay flat at all.  The heartburn continued for five hours.  I threw up twice after which I was able to fall asleep.  By the next morning I felt better from the Pfizer shot, but extremely tired from little sleep.  As the day progressed I continued to improve.

He has been having fever since yesterday morning running 102.7-103.9F. Called PCP and was advised to present to the ED yesterday but he did not. He fell after losing his balance today. Endorses nausea, confusion. Has extensive medical history. Patient has signs of sepsis with likely bacterial infection acute cystitis/pyelonephritis.  His lactate and procalcitonin are unremarkable and vitals remained stable however he does have an elevated total bilirubin as a possible sign of a more serious systemic response.  The patient does have chronic cirrhosis and persistent fever and tachycardia.  Given these clinical findings he is referred for admission for IV antibiotics and further close monitoring. Unfortunately, urine cultures were not sent.  His blood cultures however did grow 2 of 2 bottles positive for Klebsiella pneumonia.  These are both sensitive to Levaquin.  In the course of his hospitalization, he has improved.  He is now requesting discharge.  Will discharge home on p.o. Levaquin.  Is discharged in improved condition.

                                                Patient told pharmacist he has habit of passing out when giving blood or getting shots.  He was nervous.  He did well getting shot, set in room for 5 min., then moved him to waiting room where I asked him to stay 15-20 more min. Over a few min he looked very pale, we offered him water. (he barely sipped any). after 5 min he started sweating. He did not call for help, but technician on duty saw him put his head in his lap. We both went out to tend to him. While we were talking to him, he passed out. We called 911. While giving vitals and info to 911, he came to before they got on scene.  While paramedics were assessing him, after about 5-10 more min...he passed out again. This time when he came to, seconds later...he projectile vomited on the paramedics.  They tended to him until about 1:15-1:30. PT refused their suggestion and urging to go with them to hospital. Paramedics left him in pharmacy to leave facility on his own will. Pt refused our suggestion to call someone to come pick him up and not drive.  After sitting outside to get some fresh air, PT came through our drive thru to tell us he was much better and leaving Store. We told him we would call and check on him 5/17/2021. We have called now 2 days (5/17/ and 5/18) and can not get him to return our call.

He had headache, nausea, disoriented.  Then he went to bed, woke up at 9:00 AM and had a seizure, which he has had in the past but it had been over a year.  He rested after the seizure and knew what to do and it took 2-3 days to recover from that due to the weakness in the legs, disoriented.   He has gotten stronger and is pretty much back to his normal self.  He has not had any additional seizures since then.   He had his FU physical today and she is aware of the seizure and told them to report the incident.

Never had previous issues with any vaccines or injections, and never previously had vasovagal response.  Since injection, I was constipated for 3 days and suffering extreme muscular/skeletal pain and headaches.

This has since migrated down my rib cage. I also experienced nausea, dizziness, headache, and muscle aches the following two days. Those have since subsided. The swollen lymph node under my arm is still with me today.

                                                The evening of the shot my body basically turned on itself and began an all out mission to rid the vaccine.  Of course, that couldn&#39;t happen, but my body was going to proceed until I was dead or recovering.  I began having severe chills, roasting heat flashes, headache, and body ache.  Every sweat gland turned on full blast and did not turn off.  I began to vomit in outrageous fashion.  As violent as I&#39;ve ever experienced.  I had &#34;sessions&#34; of vomiting at least thirty times from Thurs night to Monday afternoon.  When I could get out of the bathroom, I would collapse back into my sweat soaked bed.  I would have an awful time trying to catch my breath.  It would be up to ten minutes of hyperventilating and racing pulse, until it would suddenly normalize.  And then I&#39;d be utterly exhausted and slip into some kind of semi-sleep coma.  This would not last even an hour before I&#39;d be racing to the bathroom again.  This was the first sixty hours.  Vomit. Hyperventilate. Wish for death.  Sleep coma. Repeat.  About 24 hrs in I added severe diarrhea that was a part of every bathroom journey from then on.  Ate nothing.  Couldn&#39;t take normal meds.  Sipped some pedialite.  Late Sunday I turned a corner and felt like I wouldn&#39;t die.  Took a full seven days for me to get any energy back and feel human again.- Every single symptom besides headache, was the worst I&#39;ve ever experienced.

A 49-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via unspecified route on right shoulder single dose for COVID-19 immunization; second dose with lot number: EV10161 on 22Apr2021, first dose with lot number: EP7533 on 01Apr2021, at 49-year-old. Medical history and concomitant medication were not reported. The patient was non-smoker, non-drinker. The patient had a little headache with the second shot but 2 weeks later on 03May2021 started having chills every night and would sweat. He was having chills and hot flashes and stomach was cramping and when inhaled like taking a deep breath, felt pressure in his back almost like pneumonia like lungs were filling with fluid or clotting. On the 07May2021, he took a little flu medication Theraflu over the counter (treatment) thinking that&#39;d clear it up. Every time he took a deep breath, it&#39;d just hurt right below my chest and in stomach and skin became extremely prickly. He&#39;d have like a low-grade fever like 99. This was 2 weeks after the second shot, so he went to the ER on 07May2021 and was given a COVID test, a fluid test and lab work trying and figure what he was having. One of his blood test - Dimer test showed kind of high levels with mainly blood clot so they gave him a CT scan, scan showed no blood clots, no kidneys stones or anything like that should had any sweating. ER doctor gave him an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) for infection like diverticulitis or diverticulosis. The doctor said the patient did not have a stomach infection, his tests showing such high levels for clots so the doctor did more lab work a PRC, CRT, TRP or CPR, a CRT lab work and some fiber or Fibrogen which was for thickening of blood. Those numbers are supposed to be between 400 and 420, his was 879 today (17May2021). The patient did have COVID, it was positive COVID antigen test, I got those results today (17May2021). Outcome of the events was unknown.

An 49-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 11May2021 16:45 (Lot Number: EW0182; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1st 0.3 ml single dose at the age of 49-years-old for covid-19 immunisation; testosterone cipionate, via an unspecified route of administration from 2020 (Lot Number: 88945; Expiration Date: 30Sep2021) and ongoing, at 150 mg, 2x/week (150 mg injection bi weekly ) for gonads, low testosterone. The patient medical history included low testosterone, gastrooesophageal reflux disease, COVID in the past (He did not know initially he had it, he had lost of taste and smell). Concomitant medication included dexlansoprazole (DEXILANT) taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing. None prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No family medical history relevant to AEs. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect. The patient experienced anaphylactic reaction (medically significant) on 17May2021. Time of onset (24-hour clock): Roughly 18:00. Usually he took the testosterone in the morning, but he forgot. He was wrapping up the day, took the testosterone and by 18:02 he was on the ground, cold. The patient got his vaccination last Tuesday (11May2021). He was also on testosterone for gonadism. He usually administered the vaccine in his shoulders. He took the testosterone bi-weekly. On Monday he administered it his left shoulder and on Thursday it is in his right shoulder. After getting the vaccine he administered testosterone in his right shoulder on Thursday and had no issues. The patient mentioned everyone else who got the COVID Vaccine he knows had sore arm, nausea, but he did not have any of that. On Monday (17May2021) he injected his testosterone into the same arm/location, left arm, where he got the COVID vaccine and had an anaphylactic reaction. He contacted his doctor and went to the emergency room. The patient confirmed he felt like he had recovered completely from the anaphylactic reaction. Caller clarified the anaphylactic reaction. He did the testosterone injection in the same spot he had the COVID injection. Within 5 minutes it was like his skin was on fire. He was sweating, had stomach cramps, and was throwing up. Once he stopped throwing up he looked at his arms and saw they were solid red. They were all inflamed. His legs were inflamed. His hands swelled up. They were red. He had to take his wedding ring off. He was itchy. It was like he was on fire. He was sore, and sore where injected the Testosterone into left arm. He confirmed he had no problems swallowing or breathing. Based on the symptoms he was experiencing he realized these were things listed to be aware of when getting the COVID shot and to seek medical attention for. He went to the ER and they verified it was an anaphylactic reaction. Treatment included: He was given an Epi-Pen. It made him feel like off, like he had too much coffee or something. he was also given Benadryl and some Anti-Inflammatory to calm his body down. Investigations: He had blood drawn at the ER. However, he does not know if was actually tested. He was informed when the nurse drew blood it would be up to the doctor, but he has no knowledge if anything was done. Action taken of testosterone cypionate was dose not changed. Outcome of the events was recovered on 17May2021.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1685; expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper right arm on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure high, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hypertension all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, and was a former smoker. Concomitant medication included lisinopril and methylphenidate. The patient reported that after he received the vaccine, he tested positive for Covid on 30Dec2020. The patient further reported that he ended up getting significant gastritis on Christmas Eve, which he didn&#39;t think about acquiring COVID, he had had the vaccine, he ate a bunch of holiday fare, so he thought he had got a stomach bug or something like that. He says he had considerable diarrhea on Christmas morning, but no fever or chills, then those symptoms resolved by Saturday, and he didn&#39;t think about it, he didn&#39;t have any issues. He says that he went to get tested, which they do frequently, and his temperature was checked frequently at the places he goes and he had no fever, and is still not febrile now. He says that he gets a weekly COVID test which allows for him to enter different facilities, and this was the first time in 9 months that he tested positive since this all came out. He says he has worked in some heavy duty places, but he wears his PPE, his respirator, his shield, and still did this stuff after he got the vaccine, he didn&#39;t let his guard down since it might take a while for immunity to kick in, but he still didn&#39;t think that it could be possible to have COVID on Christmas Eve, he was rather surprised he was positive. The patient confirms that he hasn&#39;t had the second dose of the vaccine yet. He says that his diarrhea improved on day or two starting after he had been having bloating on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. He says his diarrhea resolved, he took no medication for it, and had no change in his heart rate or breathing, no problems anywhere else, he didn&#39;t feel that bad, except for the going to the bathroom. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: positive on 30Dec2020. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this subject cannot be completely excluded.  Further information like confirmative virus genome /nucleic acid detection needed for meaningful medical assessment.

I felt heart palpitations and checked my heart rate which was 117, increasing to a max of 123.  I was placed on a pulse ox monitor, which showed 93%, BP was elevated at 146/85. I was not given any  medical treatment, and was placed on a monitor for one hour.  Once my hr and 02 stas were at my baseline, I was allowed to be discharged. I went back to my department and  decided to go home, as I felt tired and was mildly nauseous.

                                                At 1:30 am the following morning I woke up very nauseous and started vomiting.  Was nauseous all that day needing to take nausea medicine. Unable to eat anything I started to vomit stomach acid. It is now 2 days later and I still have a degree of nausea and am unable to work today. I got the 2nd vaccine on Monday.  It is Wednesday and I still have no appetite for food and have lost about 7 lbs since the weekend. I feel that I am starting to round the corner to recovery though.

Commuted to work without issue. ~ 1400: As day progressed, nausea subsided, but fatigue grew more profound and developed pain in the right subscapular area with exertional shortness of breath walking any length of time. (Injection of initial and second doses were both in right deltoid). 1540 - 1800: Fatigue increased, developed a burning/tearing pain with every yawn and deep breath from the top of my trachea into both left and right mainstem bronchi and radiated to right arm.  It literally felt like someone was trying to tear out my bronchial tree with each breath. 1800: Arrived home and medicated self-medicated with Motrin 400mg. 1800 -2030: rested at home with still some breathing pain, no shortness of breath, but incredibly tired. 2045: Went to bed and slept for the next 12.5 hours without any issued during the night. 0800: Woke up nearly all symptoms were gone, only some minor residual fatigue.  No breathing pain, no nausea, no subscapular pain. I did not seek medical attention for symptoms, nor did I contact my provider. I experienced fatigue and a headache with the first dose, but no other symptoms.  I never experienced fever or chills

At time of reporting (2/9/21 at 1100) client reports progression of swelling from left armpit to left side of stomach. Client reports &#34;it looks like [he&#39;s] gained about 15 pounds on the left side of my body&#34; from armpit to stomach. Client reports he is having no pain or discomfort, but feels &#34;a noticeable pressure from fluid buildup on left side of body.&#34; Client went to see internal medicine physician 2/9/21.

                                                Initial confusion upon waking at 7AM. Uncomfortable but unable to determine why. Tried to re-arrange pillows but could not get arms to complete the process even though fully mobile. A minor amount of weakness in arms/legs and tingling across the lower face, particularly on the right side. Once up, had an inability to form words even though thoughts were coherent. Minor difficulty swallowing water. Speech slurred badly enough to be incomprehensible to my wife. By 7:30 we arrived at the hospital where symptoms were improving.

                                                I received my shot on Wednesday, March 24th at 2 pm.  On Saturday, March 26th ,  I woke up to stomach cramps, chills, and fatigue which lasted throughout the day on Saturday and subsided by the next morning. However, the tinnitus in my left ear had increased to a more noticeable and distracting noise level. Previously, I would describe my tinnitus on a scale of 1-10 (with 10 being most severe) as a &#34;2&#34;. Since Saturday, March 26th at noon the tinnitus has reached a level of 4 or 5. It can be distracting when I am in a quiet environment trying to work, something I have never experienced before. I am concerned that this will continue to worsen.

                                                No immediate reaction but 5 days later (April 1) lymph nodes on neck were painful but went away after a day. But nausea and loss of appetite which started 5 days later on April 1 still remain as of today 4/7.  It doesn&#39;t prevent me from eating or any other problems just definitely not myself.     What&#39;s even more strange is my desire to drink 7up because of feeling sick. Haven&#39;t drank this stuff in over 30 years. But the feeling of nausea triggered past memoires of drinking 7up to feel better.

                                                Slight stomach pain began 7 hours after injection. As the night progressed, I felt the pain getting stronger. After eating dinner, I was expecting the pain to subside, but that did not happen. As the pain became more intense, I decided to lay down for the night. I was awaken in the middle of the night with several bouts with sharp abdominal pains. I took (2) Tylenol for the pain in the middle of the night. The next morning, the pain was still there, and more intense. The day after I continued to experience constant sharp abdominal pains. Again, I took another (2) Tylenol for the pain. As the day progressed I continued to experience sharp abdominal pains. I thought it might have been trapped wind, so I took Miralax. Unfortunately that did not help. Again, I went to bed the second evening with concerns this may be a reaction to the virus. On the third day, I started to feel slightly better. I the sharp abdominal pains were subsiding from a level 10 down to a level 8. As the day progressed, down to a level 6. However, I began to feel a headache in the front right lobe. So, I took (2) Tylenol and went to bed. On day four, I woke without any abdominal pains, however I still had a headache and it was non-stop. This continued through day four and through the evening. On day five I still had a headache, but  was feeling slightly better. By end of day five the headache stared to subside. On day six, I was feeling back to normal.

                                                About 4 hours after receiving the 2nd dose, my left arm started to become sore (where the shot was given) About 10 hours after receiving the 2nd dose, I started feeling &#34;fluish&#34; (achy, feverish, nauseous) All throughout that evening, the symptoms became worse and worse where I repeatedly took my temperature thinking I had a very high temperature only for it to read &#34;below&#34; normal at 97.3. The symptoms continued to get worse, without much sleep throughout the night and into the next day and evening.  I almost scheduled an appointment with my primary care physician on 4/24 because I felt so horrible.  It wasn&#39;t until about 11 am on the 2nd day  after receiving the shot (4/25) that I felt somewhat better and by that evening around 6pm, felt normal again. The 2nd dose was absolutely, without a doubt, MUCH worse of symptoms than the first dose. I hope this helps and please contact me with any questions or to help further.

A 50-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL0140), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 15Jan2021 at 12:00 as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. Historical vaccine of BNT162B2 was given as first dose on 28Dec2020. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included varicella zoster vaccine rge (SHINGRIX) taken for an unspecified indication from 14Dec2020 to an unspecified stop date, Escitalopram (ESCITALOPRAM), amfetamine aspartate, amfetamine sulfate, dexamfetamine saccharate, dexamfetamine sulfate (ADDERALL), MVI, ergocalciferol (VIT D) and calcium (CALCIUM) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. On 16Jan2021 at 11:00 patient experienced fatigue, chills, body ache and low-grade fever. Symptoms were significant enough that he remained in bed and missed planned activities. Second set of symptoms began on 06Feb2021. Patient says the second set of symptoms is most likely unrelated to his Pfizer COVID vaccine. However, sharing this might be helpful in the event other recipients describe similar symptoms and timing. Symptoms began at 03:00 AM as mild dyspepsia, bloating and loose stools and mild bilateral LBP. Pepcid relieved my dyspepsia which slowly resolved over 24 hours. The bloating has resolved but I have persistent loose stools and mild LBP. During this time patient have had no fever or symptoms of URI. All the symptoms have been mild and have not prevented him from participating in planned activities. Again, doubtful this is related to vaccine but curious to know if anyone else has reported this. The outcome of the events was not recovered with diarrhea and backpain whereas recovered for the other events.

His muscles were tired, and he got a strange bump under his right armpit, and had a mild fever.  He also had little bumps around the vaccine site.

                                                Two weeks after the vaccine, I started to have stomach cramps. I also had loose stools. I noticed blood in the stools and I went to urgent care on 01/20/2021. Tests confirmed a lower bowel inflammation which I had never had an issue with before. I was advised to eat crackers and water for four days. The bowel issues lasted for two weeks. I was also experiencing tiredness even when I woke up in the morning which lasted for about two months. I have not had any more problems since that time.

Medical history included asthma, dry cough due to inhalation from fires over the years.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Contracted Covid after receiving the first vaccine was reported. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, then contracted Covid. He now had the option to receive antibodies through plasma. Since he had the vaccine, was that still an option? Or was that a no-no? He received the vaccine at work on 21Dec2020. He got sick on 22Dec2020 and he was at home. He didn&#39;t feel like eating, and can&#39;t lay down because it made it worse to cough. He didn&#39;t know what vitamins they were giving him. The patient probably should be in a hospital, but was not. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

                                                Day 8, I woke with a headache, chills, vomited 4 times, muscle aches, and heart palpitations all day until around 8 pm. I couldn&#39;t keep food down until then. From Day 8 until yesterday (Day 11), I have been having intermittent episodes of heart palpitations, which is my only serious concern.  I have had a declining number of heart palpitations today, Day 12, but felt I should report these heart palpitations in case this is a sign of a serious complication. Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

Took solu-medrol dose pack and abdominal pain symptoms  improved, but still not fully resolved.   On Feb 16 was seen by PCP for persisting, unilateral tinnitus.   Sent for MRI Brain which was normal .   Referred  for further evaluation by audiologist and otolaryngologist .  Was seen on  February 25, 2021 for right ear fullness, tinnitus.    Hearing test normal.   Diagnosed with right sided tinnitus.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

I went back to vaccination location and was given a cold compress. I was taken to the ER and given Benadryl and multiple nausea meds. I was there for about 5 hours. I was released and instructed to drink lots of water. I was told by the doctor that my body was doing what it was supposed to do, but to come back if I got worse. I took 2 days off and returned to work with no remaining complications.

Hives with itch appeared about 3 hours after the shot was given, along with an itchy feeling in mouth and on tongue and feeling of strangeness in throat. I felt mostly normal during the 30 minutes after the shot, but developed a headache, chills, mildly upset stomach. I have anxiety issues and was nervous about getting shot so was hesitant to label anything as a side effect as it could be anxiety/panic disorder etc. But the rash/hives are itchy - I showered which made them itchier. I&#39;m submitting this @ 10:30pm EST, my shot was @ 2pm EST - I have taken more zyrtec worried I am having an allergic reaction. I am filing this because I am worried about the 2nd shot - I do not want to have  a worse allergic reaction after the 2nd shot. I will call my allergist. He manages my allergies and advised me to continue taking my seasonal allergy meds and zyrtec as normal during the shot today. Presently there are no hives/itch on any other parts of my body except my upper chest and upper back.

                                                About 2 and a half hours after the vaccination, I started to have pain in the body, I was shaking, headache, tired, chills. During the course of about 4-5 hours after the vaccination, I had other symptoms such as an urge to urinate, accompanied by pain and burning. Pain in the ribs, back, left arm, diarrhea, felt like inflamed lungs and shortness of breath. Today and 3 days later I still have diarrhea, headache, fatigue and pain when urinating.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left Arm on 23Mar2021 (at age of 51 years old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included did had surgery a month before and did had a bunch of lab work to get to that. Concomitant medication(s) included rosuvastatin calcium (CRESTOR), zolpidem. The patient experienced Ringing in ears, Nausea, Tinnitus, all on 13Apr2021. First dose was 23Mar2021; second dose scheduled for 14Apr2021. May delay or not get second dose. Caller states he got his first shot on 23Mar2021 (three weeks before) and is scheduled for his second shot today (14Apr2021). Says that yesterday (13Apr2021) he began experiencing ringing in his ears and nausea. States he looked online and saw that other people were also experiencing tinnitus and that it got worse after the second shot. Says some of them had said it got so bad they could not sleep or hear. He is worried about getting his second shot today and is asking if he should possibly delay it, or not get it? Patient took first vaccine 3 weeks before today and patient was due for the second vaccine today and patient started developing some ringing in ear a couple days before and patient didn&#39;t really think about much of it and so patient heard of few other people mentioned the same thing so patient was reading about it and hear that it is you know a side effect that people are experiencing. Patient just want to know if patient should not take the second dose that is scheduled for today or not, people like online people are saying the second dose made it much worse and people had severe ringing to the point where it affected their hearing and they couldn&#39;t sleep and it got along after their second dose, and that&#39;s what patient was about to go get today so patient want to know if patient should not take the second dose?&#34;. The outcome of the events was unknown. No Treatment in response to events.

My temperature increased from 97 to 104.4 over the next 6 to 7 hours and stayed above 100.4 until about 24 hours after initial symptom onset. The chills subsided as my temperature declined. I felt drained, had no appetite, and had a low grade headache that intensified on movement, particularly bending over. The headache, lack of appetite and energy, lingered after the chills and fever had subsided into the following day (5/1). On 5/2, I felt much better and was up and about at 80% of normal activity. I expect to be fully back to normal tomorrow.

He was attended to by the nurse on staff as well as myself. Reported no pain, knew his name and where he was. Stated no history of seizures and was not diabetic. Stated he has not eaten today, only a Starbucks. We got him up to a chair after a few minutes and attempted to take his blood pressure. He passed out a second time and we got him to the floor. He was alert shortly after getting him to a laying position. Ambulance was called and he was taken to be checked out.  Patient did return the next day to thank us and let us know he had a CT and labs done. His physician thought it was a vasovagal episode. He is to follow up with his primary physician soon.

After my first shot, I had minor chills, no fever, and was a little tired for two days.  However, approximately 12 hours after my second shot, I had a 101.0 F fever, with a heart rate of 105.  I did not take any fever reducing medicine.  I had a fever for two days, and slight elevation in my temperature on the third day.  My heart rate decreased over the second and third day, and went back to my normal 50s-60, four days after my second shot.  I had slight nausea the first day, and a loss of appetite two additional days.  My appetite is now back to normal.  Furthermore, I had a lot of soreness in my lower back, neck, shoulders, and knees that lasted 5 or 6 days after my second shot.  Also, I had a low-level intermittent headache the first day after the second shot.  In addition, I had significant chills that lasted 10 days after the second shot.  My chief complaint is feeling very lightheaded / unsteady when in a standing position.   Also, my exercise routine has suffered the past month.  I only walk 15 to 20 minutes and feel very tired.  Certainly, not a normal feeling for me.  I feel very tired over the past month and a half since my second shot. I have checked my EKG a few times over the past 6 weeks.  It is my normal EKG, (RBBB and LAFB) and remains unchanged.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

                                                On 5/20/21 the patient was at home with his mother when he had acute nausea, light-headedness, and abdominal pain. He presented to the ED by ambulance. Excerpt from ED notes od MD follows: &#34;Initial ED interventions: iv fluids, low dose iv ativan, iv toradol, iv zofran.  ED course: patient arrives very anxious, writhing on bed, difficult to redirect. With chronic tonicity, not seizing. Mother arrives, and he recognizes her, seems to be consoled somewhat by her presence, but she is unable to direct him, and describes his behavior as irregular, and events acute this evening at her home.  Patient rests, and then HR decrease to 50s on monitior and patient found to be pulseless - I immediately start chest compressions, and achieve ROSC after PEA arrest with administration of EPI/compressions. Patient intubated per procedure note without complication. L femoral central attained per procedure note without complication. CPR performed over ED course intermittently (always PEA arrest) with ROSC achieved with administration of EPI, EPI drip started in addition to sedation meds, and iv fluids. No obvious STEMI on ECG to administer lytics, with suspicion of dissection and AAA prominent. I am able to stabilze and accompany patient to CT suite, where I recognize B/L massive PE immediately. I discuss with Dr. of Cardiology, who agrees with admininstration of alteplase. I disucss risks with mother who consents verbally. Patient without response to alteplase, and with continued pattern of PEA arrest following bradycardia. I discuss etiology of presentation with mother,and that patient is with very poor prognosis of survival, and likely poorer prognosis of neurological status, and patient is made comfort care, and fentanyl drip increased, patient is taken off of ventilation and drips. Pronounced deceased at 22:00.  MDM: Initial concern for but not limited to appendicitis, AAA, diverticulitis, renal stones, pyelonephritis, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis, toxic ingestion, ACS, obstruction, perforation, sepsis (2/2 PNA, UTI, meningitis, intra-abdominal infection), AAA, dissection, PE - as ED course progresses, differential narrows and consider more likely PEA arrest secondary to ACS, PE, dissection, AAA, necrotic pancreatitis, tension PNX (less likely). Considered but do not suspect seizures, stroke. Imaging studies reviewed - CXR with ETT in place, no acute pathology. CTA chest/A/P remarkable for massive proximal B/L PE. Labs reviewed. ECGs without STEMI, with sinus tach initially, LBBB after initial ROSC, and then AFib in RVR on subsequent ECG. Per above, patient suffered massive B/L PE, with subsequent cardiac arrest, despite heoric efforts including thrombolysis. Death called art 22:00.  Diagnosis: massive B/L PEs, PEA arrest.  Disposition: deceased.&#34;

By the  next day (two days after the shot), these effects were gone.  The subsequent day I also felt fine.  But on the next day (the fourth day since the shot), I felt very tired, slightly nauseated, and had a mild headache.  These are all not normal and very strange.  The next day, these effects were still present but less so.  The next day (6 days since the shot), they were diminished again and almost gone.  It seemed very strange that I had side effects that started on the day of the shot, but then these were resolved within 48 hours.  However, two days later, side effects returned and new effects came.

A 51-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration in Apr2021 (at 51-year-old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, single in arm left for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing chronic back pain (diagnosed for years), and ongoing type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication was not reported. After the first dose, date unknown, he got violently ill, stated literally he got ill at the center where he got the vaccine, he was weak, started to sweat, the medical people there were a little concerned they held him there for an additional amount of time for observation after the first vaccine. He was very dizzy. (event weak, sweat and dizzy onset 24Apr2021 03:00 as reported) He went home and he was very nausea and sick, at 23:00 he laid down and slept all day until the next day. He woke up on the third day very dizzy with flu symptoms, but was able to get up and get moving and was getting better, after about a week during the four weeks between the two doses started calling doctor telling them something was wrong, got over the first three days and then the grogginess came back extreme exhaustion, noticed every night in bed if he curled up in bed or brought arms up or like now if he has arm up to his ear on the phone his arm got numb immediately. Arms went within a minute. The doctor and nurse practitioner doubted this was lingering side effects, progressively his arms were getting weaker and weaker, he was getting weaker and weaker as a person. MRI and rheumatology (lymes, MS, lupus) showed negative. The outcome of the events violently ill and arm numb was not resolved; of events weak, sweat, dizzy, nausea, sickness, flu symptoms, exhaustion, groggy and weakness of arms was unknown. The events under second dose referred to case 2021648178.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot/Batch number: EW0181), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 28May2021 as single dose for covid-19 immunization.

The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. Patient stated that after he received his first Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine dose on 28May2021, later that day he states his left arm (injection arm) started twitching, he vomited, and his left pinky and ring fingers were numb, and the patient felt nervous like he was shaking. On 14Jun2021, the patient also stated that he got the shot and the band aid that they cover the injection area with, it was branded in his arm and he got the shot 3 weeks ago and it looks like a band aid is on his arm. He thought it would be gone and it stayed. On an unknown date, the patient reported that his right leg and foot started swelling. The patient&#39;s right leg blew up. He reports the band aid to his injection site looks like it &#34;burned&#34; into his arm. He states his right/foot leg swelling and left arm twitching have continued and wants to know if this is a reported side effect. Now after he got the shot his arm has been twitching, he&#39;s sweating and vomiting all morning. His right leg blew up and he feels weird. He just doesn&#39;t feel like himself. Right after the shot, the patient felt like there&#39;s a bunch of fluid. It&#39;s ongoing, it has gone down a little bit. It&#39;s improved a little, very irritating when it does happen. He can&#39;t eat. It won&#39;t stay in his stomach and he can&#39;t hold water. It has improved but when it happens, he feels terrible. There was no emergency or physician room visit for the events. The clinical outcome for the events was unknown, the other events muscle twitching, and shaking was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

On 3rd and 4th days after shot I had slight nausea.  Slight ringing in ears on days 2, 3, and 4 after shot.  Only slight fatigue on 5th day after shot. All other symptoms gone.  6th day after shot all symptoms gone. I feel fine. I&#39;m glad I was vaccinated.

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included Covid-19 from 17Jul2020 to 14Aug2020, he didn&#39;t get hospitalized but was pretty sick. He had circulation issues with it. He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

He thought he had Covid but was tested and the result was negative. The pain became worse and moved from his spinal cord to his head. This caused him to miss work. He did not have any energy and was unable to get out of bed. He also lost his appetite. Then on 15Jan2021 his energy level was through the roof like he was on steroids&#34; The action taken was not applicable.

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

                                                Constant tearing of left eye with painful irritation in upper left corner of eyeball. Itchy tongue and roof of mouth. Duration of about an hour after washing face and flushing eyes with warm tap water. Rinsed mouth with antiseptic and drank plenty of water. Things I know to do when anything I&#39;ve ingested sparks the warning signs with the tearing up of the left eye. Since I cannot afford Epipens, I wonder if it would have helped if I was not able to breath during this reaction?

All of which are also symptoms of mild covid.  I seem OK 2 days afterwards.

The next morning, 4/23, my lymph nodes on the side of my neck, and under the tip of my chin swelled up  significantly. Still there... Then the headache started (4/23), and is still ongoing. This is accompanied with major body aches, a very low grade fever, and occasional chills. Today, 4/27 at approximately 6:30pm, I started puking.  I&#39;d rather roll the dice with Covid then get a second shot!!!!!!

A 52-years-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0173 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 08May2021 at 02:38 PM, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any other vaccine in four weeks. The patient&#39;s medical history included Bug bite (happened 5 days prior to 30Apr2021 and regimen of an antibiotic). He was completely done with the rotation for a least 8 days before he got the vaccine. It might have something to do with this. concomitant medication included dicloxacillin (started it on 30Apr2021 and it was for 5 days. He did not know what it did was). The patient reported that on 08May2021, day one, he experienced, tiredness and injection site pain. On day 2, until now side effects which had not gone away. It hadn&#39;t gotten worse, but it was not any better. The patient felt like congestion, but his nose was bone dry, like crusty dry. It hurts a little bit because it was so dry and he had arm soreness, nothing out of the ordinary. The arm soreness was just normal injection stuff. At first it was a little tender on the injection spot. It went away after about a day. On 10May2021, the patient felt like there were little, tiny baby hands pinching his internal organs randomly throughout his abdomen. It was not a sharp pain, more like a little squeeze all through his abdomen. It felt like his whole throat was swollen. It was not visually swollen, it more felt like a football in his neck. Stretching it was helping. His toes have been locking up like a pre-clamping. He had numbness from his ankles to his feet for 8 days, and now he has numbness from his knees to his feet. It was not completely numb, but it was not normal. The feeling of baby hands pinching his internal organs started the second day after the vaccine and has stayed consistent. The patient&#39;s eyes swollen, and his vision was diminished. Day 2 through today, it felt like his eyes were swollen, his vision was seriously diminished, he had a golf ball sized welt on his arm not at the injection site but 2 inches from it, and he was really dizzy and really lightheaded and almost fainted at the corner store. The feeling like his eyes were swollen started on day 3 after the vaccine. The crease of his eye be-low the eyebrow and on top of the socket got red and puffy and looked like sunburnt skin does. It was at the point that now it feels swollen all the time almost like he had pink eye and his vision has been diminished about 30%. He had a test done yesterday and his vision was 20/25. Some-times he could not even read a text and had to stare at his phone for 10 minutes to make out words. He did not have these issues before. The feeling of his eyes being swollen was a little better in the mornings and about 1300 it gets worse when he gets lightheaded to where was when it started. His vision became diminished about day 3 after the vaccine. It was a little better in the morning, but in the afternoon, it goes to exactly the same as when it started. He noticed the golf ball sized welt on his arm about 3 days ago. The doctor seemed to think a drop of the injection might had travelled from the injection site and his body was creating a defense to it. It was scary to take a shower and then see that. It didn&#39;t hurt. It was not painful, but it was a weird foreign entity. The cramping in his toes started probably day 3 and was consistent. The numbness started on day 2 after the vaccine, and up until 3 days ago it was just his ankles and feet. 3 days ago, it got to the point where it was from his knees to his feet. It has gotten worse since it was now travelling up his legs. On his injection arm- 2 inches away from the injection site appeared a size of a gigantic golf ball - when asked with his doctor he said that he thinks that a drop of the vaccine travelled and his body building a reaction to it and it was very abnormal. The patient also had numbness from his ankle to his feet worsened and from his knees to his feet- almost feels like it was cold and tingly. The patient also had dizziness and lightheaded about day 2 after the vaccine and it was the same. It came in waves but was consistent throughout the day. He would be fine then had a wave of dizziness. He has been laying down so much because he was so tired, ringing ears, felt like his glands were swollen, pressure in his neck to his injection site, and back pains. The patient stated that his doctor was only form urgent care. The patient Felt like whole throat was swollen, toes locking up, really lightheaded, mind has been foggy, and arm soreness. The patient had bizarre side effects from the Covid Vaccine for 11 days now. He thought it was the smart thing to report them to Pfizer. He didn&#39;t like to give personal information. He declined to give his mailing address or his email address. He hated when asked for race, but he guessed it might be important. He did not have a mailing address, phone number, or email address handy for his physician. He went to Urgent Care yesterday to have it checked and they did an EKG and said he had to be sent by ambulance to the ER. The doctor did bloodwork, and she said everything looked alright and to rest a few more days and keep hydrated. The patient underwent the lab work and procedures which included chest X-ray with unspecified result. He thinks it was on 18May2021. His mind has been foggy with all of that. It was yesterday or the day before. He could not be sure. He has been sleeping so much and was in a complete daze. The fogginess he had the whole time as his other symptoms, and it was the same. He has been eating well and hydrating and taking a multivitamin and Gatorade, all the things&#39; people say to do. He asked if Pfizer has heard of this before. He was panicked it might be chronic, and he worries about the safety of the second shot for him. He was sure many people haven&#39;t reacted, but these are freaky side effects. He asked for advice and if Pfizer had heard of this before or if he was some weird anomaly. On his way to get the vaccine he asked 2 people at the city health line if they had taken it and they both said no. He asked 3 other patients and they said they took the Pfizer. One woman said she will take it when they make her. The guy who gave him the shot lied and said he wasn&#39;t eligible. It might have been his way of not having to discuss it. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was not diagnosed with Covid prior vaccination. The patient was tested for Covid post vaccination with Nasal Swab on 18May2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Device Date: 23May2021,Additional information has been requested.

A 52-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 15May2021 10:50 (Lot Number: EW0173; Expiration Date: 31Aug2021) as 1ST DOSE, SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included vasovagal reactions in high school. No other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Within 2 minutes of receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he started feeling like something was wrong. He pulled to the side in the parking garage and as soon as he stopped the car he passed out. He woke back up and was able to put the car in park and he passed out a second time. He woke up again and his foot was on the gas pedal and he tried to roll down the window. He was able to roll down the window but he wasn&#39;t able to get anyone&#39;s attention. He passed out a third time. When he woke up again he wasn&#39;t able to get the door open and he was nauseated. He basically had nausea, dizziness, and a definite lack of coordination. He just had sort of a feeling like being really drunk. He doesn&#39;t drink. He had very little strength but he was able to push his car horn. He was out of it. He could see someone in his car mirror a little ways behind his car and the horn didn&#39;t get the person&#39;s attention so he honked a second time and someone came to help him, maybe from the fire department and maybe some emergency medical technicians. He was placed on a golf cart or ATV to be transported downstairs to a waiting ambulance and while on the ride he vomited himself. He mentioned that the EMTs called it a vasovagal reaction. He was brought to the hospital in which he had a lot of tests done. He did not feel well at all and was not able to feel well enough to stand up. He had tests done at the hospital, a chest x-ray and his blood was drawn. He had a cardiac ultrasound later in the afternoon the next day on 16May2021. The doctor&#39;s didn&#39;t find anything wrong other than his cholesterol was high at 208. He was admitted to the hospital on 15May2021. He continued to have his blood drawn through the night and the next morning, on 16May2021, he had a CAT scan. For his cholesterol he was told to eat better and maybe follow up with a doctor in a couple months to check his cholesterol again. No one had any answers to the effect of what happened to him. Everything was fine, his tests were normal. He was told he had a vasovagal reaction. He&#39;s had vasovagal reactions before and he can tell this was much different than the vasovagal reactions he&#39;s had before. In the past when he&#39;s had vasovagal reactions the world went black like looking through a small circle, his vision got blacker and blacker and then he&#39;d pass out. He did not have this feeling with the Covid 19 vaccine. He can only describe this feeling that he had like an occasion in his past when he&#39;s drank to much and he&#39;s stumbling around. He may have passed out briefly to someone helping him move to a bed and his arms are weighted and he can&#39;t lift them and he&#39;s disoriented but still has a sense of what&#39;s going on but he feels like he could vomit at any second. He&#39;s comparing his experience to the Covid 19 vaccine to drinking to much alcohol and then falling asleep or passing out. He was pretty much out of it for 5 hours. Between the fourth and fifth hours after receiving the Covid 19 vaccine he was comfortable enough to stand on his own for brief moments. He was feeling better and was able to use the restroom. By the next day, around the 24 hour period after the vaccine he was feeling almost normal. He was released from the hospital the next day, 16May2021 at around 4:00PM. He was maybe in the hospital for about 27 to 28 hours. At the hospital he had all these tests and he was found to be healthy with no problems. He also had a Covid 19 virus test, he never asked what the results were but he&#39;s going under the assumption that if he was Covid 19 virus positive the hospital staff would have told him. Passing out, nausea, dizziness required a visit to Emergency Room. The outcome was unknown.

                                                Two days after the second dose, started to experience headaches, lightheadedness and nausea pretty much constant for the next 6 weeks.  Went to primary care physician the 2nd week and he thought it was vaccine related.  One week later it had got worse so went back to other primary care physician in the same office who thought I had vertigo and an ear infection.  I then followed up with an ENT who said I did not have an ear infection but thought my symptoms were vaccine related and stated she had seen multiple other patients with same symptoms.    At one point the headache and nausea was so bad I went to an urgent care clinic who did a CT scan thinking it might be a stroke but later ruled that out.   the initial primary care physician had ordered some blood tests which then prompted a referral to a hematologist/Oncologist who did more testing and concluded that thought my issues were vaccine related.   Can provide additional detail around physicians and dates if needed

That was not well controlled with Tylenol - still stayed about 100.5. Also had some gastro-intestinal distress - diarrhea. Lasted for about 36 hours. And then my fever went down and I felt pretty good but still experiencing some low grade fatigue and a little congestion which is lingering from first dose. Lingering effects may be from COVID

                                                1st symptom: Within 30 seconds, ache in arm from elbow to wrist.  Got worse over next few minutes, fairly uncomfortable for about 45 minutes before subsiding slightly (tried to keep moving arm as recommended).  Pain returned when I drove to work and while at my desk.  Lasted for approx 4 more hours.  Injection at 11:15am, pain mostly ended around 9:30pm (except when reaching or extending arm, pain in shoulder now mostly). 2nd symptom: Mild nausea starting about 5 min after injection, while in waiting room.  Passed when laying down at home before work, approx 45 min later..  Started again while driving to work and lasted from about 4pm to 8pm.  Subsided about 10pm.   3rd symptom - feel very fatigued.at typing of this report at 10pm - started about 5pm. So far nothing else - no headache or chills for example.  No pain at all at the actual injection site - now the pain is mostly above it - from the shoulder joint to near the injection site (maybe a couple inches above.) as well as the forearm, all around.   To make coping easier in case the symptoms (arm ache, fatigue, etc) are worse as commonly described from the 2nd dose I put in and was approved for PTO from work for scheduled 2nd date on  March 30th.   Will allow me to rest (avoid being effected at work with the fatigue and an even more achy arm as expected side effects of 2nd dose)

By 9pm Thursday my entire body ached severely as if I had a very bad flu. By 11pm I had very severe cold &amp; hot shakes and felt extremely nauseous until the next morning. I checked my temp every couple hours and never was I above 98.5 but, I felt extremely sick until about 48 hours after the 2nd shot. On Friday, and for the next 2-3 days, I felt fatigued as if I was recovering from the flu. Only a flu that was without fever or any respiratory issues.  By Monday I felt normal again.

A 53-year-old male patient received the second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Mar2021 at age of 53-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included autoimmune autonomic disorder, Sjogren&#39;s disease, Crohn&#39;s (in remission 3 decades), COVID, known allergies: Ototoxic reaction to clarithromycin (BIAXIN), also skin rash to levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO). Concomitant medication included doxycycline taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. No other vaccine was used in four weeks. No COVID tested post vaccination. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Mar2021 06:45 PM at age of 53-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. Approximately 4 days after the first COVID shot (05Mar2021), the patient developed constipation. This constipation continued and worsened 4 days after his second Pfizer shot (27Mar2021). On 23Mar2021, the patient developed tinnitus and a very dry mouth. Coincident with the dry mouth, the top of his tongue had turned white and he have developed a serious taste distortion in his mouth. The constipation initially partially responded to laxatives between the first and second vaccinations, but starting 4 after the second vaccination, the laxatives have stopped working. The events were resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Disability or permanent damage. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included abdominal CT, blood tests, hearing test, all with unknown results. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                In the days after my first covid shot, the number of bowel movements started to climb from 15 a day to over 30 a day.  I also developed difficulties with urination and a sense of urgency.  By the time of my second shot, I was seeing blood in my stool.  The first shot may have triggered an infection or sever inflammation in my small intestines, as I had my large intestine removed in 2015.  My doctor asked me to report this as other of his patients have seen similar issues.

When I got to him, he was on the ground, eyes open, but seriously disoriented. He got up to the couch. He was very, very clammy and his heart rate was 44 bpm.  I held three fingers for him to identify, he correctly answered. He has a small gash on his forehead.  His heart rate came up to 70, 20 minutes after episode. Refused to go to urgent care.

A 53-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered in arm left (left shoulder) on 30Mar2021 09:00 (Lot Number: ER8733) at age of 53 years old as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none. Family medical history relevant to events: caller states he don&#39;t think so, his father had high blood pressure and diabetes. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen taken for tooth disorder at 600 mg every 8-12 hours, taking it probably a week before receiving the vaccine. No prior vaccinations (within 4 weeks). No events following prior vaccinations. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer Suspect. The patient experienced slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at on 30Mar2021, chills on 02Apr2021, fever on 02Apr2021, sweating on 02Apr2021, continued muscle pain on 03Apr2021, skin, hair was hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin on 03Apr2021, muscular pain down to pelvis and knees aching on 03Apr2021, diarrhea on 03Apr2021, fatigue in 2021, headache in 2021, weakness and dizziness in 2021, sinus drainage in 2021, feels dehydrated in 2021.  The patient was calling to report some long term, severe side effects. He received the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine on 30Mar2021. He didn&#39;t have anything then muscle pain for the first two and a half days, no reaction until on Friday 02Apr2021 he had extreme chills, fever, sweating, then that continued on to be muscle pain, his skin and hair were hurting, couldn&#39;t touch skin through Sunday 04Apr2021. It dissipated into muscular and inner-skeletal pain. He had muscular pain down to pelvis and knees and things would start aching.  Now it was kind of letting up. It was the 4th day now and no one he knows who had gotten it had such a long term reaction to this. Clarified that he had slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at and that dissipated on Thursday 01Apr2021 and he had no pain anymore and no other side effects. On Friday 02Apr2021 afternoon when it went haywire and thought he may have to go to the hospital on Sunday 04Apr2021. He had diarrhea and almost had everything on the list except redness at the site injection. He also did not have swollen lymph nodes. He didn&#39;t think he needed to go to the hospital, he normally didn&#39;t get sick and hadn&#39;t been ill for years and this was why he wanted to report it because it seemed that it was pulling for along time. He had been sleeping and drinking a lot of liquids. Headache, joint pain, and diarrhea continued all the way through Monday 05Apr2021 and started to dissipate Monday evening. He had no nausea and vomiting. The muscular pain down to pelvis started Saturday 03Apr2021. His knee would ache and then that would stop and then his other knee would ache then stop. It was like it would transfer around lower part of body, and that dissipated late Monday 05Apr2021 night into Tuesday (06Apr2021). Now he had fatigue was tired and had sinus drainage. He felt dehydrated and couldn&#39;t seem to drink enough liquids to get the feeling of dry mouth out.  The diarrhea, fatigue and the sinus drainage was still continuing and the other symptoms seem to have dissipated. He still felt so fatigued and didn&#39;t feel the other symptoms are there. He hoped they didn&#39;t return. It had stayed the same for the diarrhea, fatigue and sinus drainage and he was still tired. Later added he did have weakness and dizziness, but assumed it was fever and chills. Caller states he did have weakness and dizziness and Saturday 03Apr2021 and Sunday 04Apr2021 were the worst two for all of the symptoms at the same time. It had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021 evening. Outcome of weakness and dizziness: Caller initially confirmed it had dissipated as of Monday 05Apr2021. However, he later stated he was still experiencing slightness there. He still feels some weakness, and feels about 60% right now.  He thought it would be a good idea to get vaccinated because he had family members that had contracted covid-19 and be less weary of the virus. He was hesitant now to get the second shot. He was taking ibuprofen because he had issues with a tooth. He was taking Benadryl for the sinus and hadn&#39;t taken it in 36 hours and hadn&#39;t taking anything else. He was already taking Ibuprofen for the tooth issue, but was also using it to relieve some of the symptoms and if it was indeed that he may have contracted something after that. He hadn&#39;t been to the doctor but for checks ups in years and years.  Time of Onset (24-hour clock): Caller stated it started about 1-2 pm in the afternoon on Friday 02Apr2021 and came on very quickly. The events did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office. The outcome of slight pain at left shoulder where the injection site was at was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of diarrhea, fatigue, sinus drainage was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 53-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EW0151) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 09Apr2021 12:30 at age of 53-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included high cholesterol, anxiety disorder, known allergies: Clonazepam (KLONOPIN), food allergies: sea bass and orange roughy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; lovastatin taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; ibuprofen taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date; fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine, lot number EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 18Mar2021 11:00 AM at age of 53-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was currently 11 days out from receiving his second COVID vaccine and he was still having very strong side effects. This included an emergency room visit on 16Apr2021. He was generally very good health and he exercised regularly including running so these were very abnormal effects for him. Beginning one day after receiving his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine for COVID-19: 1. Strong chest pressure and fluctuating heartbeat. 2. Slower breathing and respiratory response. 3. Extreme fatigue &amp; very low energy (for example, walking up two flights of stairs made him very tired and spikes his heart rate, abnormal for him). 4. Loss of appetite and loss of weight. 5. Abnormally wide fluctuation of blood pressure while not exerting himself. For example, higher blood pressure readings (155/95) with a slower pulse (60) or the opposite scenario, (110/89) elevated pulse 98. 6. Difficulty relaxing and sleeping. 7. Nausea and some dizziness. 8. Stomach pain and diarrhea. 9. Headaches. 10. Low grade fever. As of 26Apr2021, it stated the day after the patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination (10Apr2021 12:00 PM), he began to have side effects which he expected to some extent. However, as of today, he has 17 days straight of side effects or perhaps an adverse event. His symptoms began mildly the day after but suddenly increased greatly within the next couple days and he had been dealing with this ever since. He had made two emergency room visits, seen his general practitioner, and as of today (26Apr2021) a cardiologist who ordered imaging. His symptoms range from, extreme fatigue, nausea, strong stomach and intestinal discomfort, weight loss, shortness of breath, sudden increased heart rates and high blood pressure readings, intense chest pressure and some pain, powerful involuntary shaking of my body that comes in waves, and pressure and pain in the back of his head at the cerebellum. His life was basically come to a screeching halt and he was searching for answers! The doctors he had spoken to were unclear as to what was wrong with him and why. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment received for the events. COVID tested post vaccination on 17Apr2021 included PCR and Nasal Swab, both showed negative result. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 53-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6203; expiration date: Jun2021), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 27Feb2021 18:00 as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing lyme disease. There were no concomitant medications. The patient went through post- vaccination especially because he has Lyme disease. He has had this pre-existing autoimmune disease for 8, almost 9 years, he wants to add this information to the database. Caller states the first shot he would say was kind of catastrophic, the second shot, he will go into. Caller states the second shot, he showed up at the military vaccination place locally and they actually declined his ability to get it with them because of his first reaction even though he had the go ahead from his Lyme specialist and primary doctors. Caller states because of this, he went after four weeks instead of three and he went to a high risk clinic to protect him from anaphylaxis. He has received both doses, the first dose was horrendous and the second was quite easy. Caller states no reaction whatsoever with the second, though he still has remaining symptoms. Reporter Details: Caller states his legal name is (Name), he goes by (Name). Caller states he would prefer if company contacted him and also so that maybe they can warn people with autoimmune or Lyme that the first one is going to be kind of rough. Caller states he works with the public. Prescribing Healthcare Professional: Caller states unsure of email address. Caller states the only thing missing off the initial story is that all in all, the second shot was really good. Caller states he does have some very lingering issues still that he is going to be seeing the Lyme specialist about. Caller states the first dose, it&#39;s pretty intense. Caller states the second one, he had fatigue and neuropathy from the stupid autoimmune stuff. Caller states there is residual symptoms, but nothing like the initial ones. Caller states what he did was he just jotted some notes down about every third or fourth day up until the second shot just to detail each symptom. Caller states he only wrote about 5 days worth of little sentences. Caller states 27Feb2021, the first dose, it was a Saturday so by Monday 29Feb2021, it started with itching, burning rashes, so like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps, neuropathy- shooting pains in his fingers and toes that feels like bugs are crawling all over him, headache, fatigue, and dizziness. Caller verifies all of these symptoms actually began on 01Mar2021. Itching, burning rashes: Caller states he would say they lasted about 2-3 weeks because he went to the walk-in to have them check and called his primary doctor and went into his primary and had him check. Caller states it ended sometime in Mar2021 and he has recovered completely. Neuropathy: Shooting pains in his fingers and toes: Caller verifies it began 01Mar2021. Caller states he would say he still has about 20% left. Caller states it is hard to sleep at night because he still gets itching and burning and stuff. Caller states it is persisting, but certainly not as bad. Headache: Caller verifies it started 01Mar2021. Caller states it ended Mar2021 and has recovered completely. Fatigue: Caller states began 01Mar2021. Caller states this is one of the bad ones he would say. Caller states he still, he would like to go for a walk or work out and he barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others. Caller states he can&#39;t workout or walk. Caller states if he goes up and down stairs, he&#39;s exhausted. Caller states that&#39;s definitely a lasting one. Caller verifies it is ongoing, persisting. Dizziness: Caller verifies it began on 01Mar2021 and is ongoing. Caller states when he walks he literally cannot turn his head quickly or he feels like he&#39;s going to throw up or pass out. Caller verifies it is persisting. Caller states he would say about 4 or 5 days later from getting the first shot, this was really interestingly weird, he had mouth sores that wouldn&#39;t heal and debilitating malaise and fatigue. Caller states malaise so bad he couldn&#39;t get through work, he could barely work. Caller states the mouth sores were so weird. Caller states everything he is telling company he has read about online. Caller states he has had canker sores from low immunity, but this was on the tip of his tongue, either side of the tongue tip, it came and went three or four times through the entire month. Caller states it was like his immune system was on the edge of crashing, then he would sleep a lot more. Caller states he would do whatever he could do to make it come back. Caller verifies this debilitating fatigue is different than overall fatigue that began 01Mar2021. Caller states the debilitating malaise began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Debilitating Fatigue; Debilitating Malaise: Caller states the debilitating fatigue also began 04Mar2021 or 05Mar2021. Caller states it is acute. Caller states ended sometime in Mar2021. Caller states recovered completely but is still left with some fatigue. Caller states recovered with lasting effects maybe. Caller says the other one, he could barely get up, he could barely work, he literally couldn&#39;t function. Caller states the overall fatigue has not left, it&#39;s ongoing. Mouth sores that won&#39;t heal: Caller states began around 004Mar2021 or 05Mar2021 and stopped sometime in Apr2021, it took about a month. Caller states he recovered completely. Caller states he just wrote what happened down about every 2 days up until 14Mar2021. Joint Pain: Caller states literally every single joint in his body was killing him and felt inflamed. Caller states it began around 03Mar2021 or 04Mar2021. Caller states joint pain is ongoing, but has improved. Air Hunger, shortness of breath upon exertion: Caller states if he went up and down a few stairs, he would breathe almost as if he was having an asthma attack, it was shortness of breath upon exertion and started about four days after. Caller states it began around 05Mar2021. Caller states he actually had it this morning, felt like he just walked up a flight of stairs. Caller states he is very physically fit, so that should not happen. Caller states it&#39;s ongoing and has improved. Numb Extremities: Caller states a week later from 01Mar2021 he had numb extremities. Caller states he started being very aware of the fact that his fingers and toes were starting to lose feelings on 08Mar2021. Caller states it resolved within a week on 15Mar2021. Caller states it was a weird sensation that happened for a while but is completely resolved now. Body Temperature Regulation Issues: Caller states two days later, he had body temperature regulation issues. Caller states he was cold when he should have been hot and hot when he should have been cold. Caller states began around 03Mar2021/04Mar2021 and is ongoing, but not terrible, it&#39;s probably the least of the issues and has improved. Heart was pounding out of his chest; face was flushed: Caller states a day or two later, his heart was pounding out of his chest and his face was flushed to the point where people were asking if he was okay. Caller states he felt like he got a quick burst of a run and then stood still. His face was visibly red and very aware of his heart beating out of his chest and this is with no exertion. Caller states he was laying on the couch and he could feel his face flush while doing nothing basically. Caller states began 02 or 03Mar2021 and just stopped a week ago around 12Apr2021. He recovered completely, for now, it seems. Caller states he went to (Clinic name) on (Address), he doesn&#39;t have the doctors name, it was a walk-in. Caller states they literally said no big deal, it&#39;s all side effects of the vaccine, they just said he&#39;s fine. Caller states they simply recommended anti-inflammatories, Tylenol, which was smart and he wishes he thought about it. They also recommended Benadryl to stop the reaction. Caller states it was very helpful, the Benadryl really helped a lot. Caller states there was also a good amount of insomnia because of all the symptoms, it would be close to impossible to sleep. Insomnia: Caller states it seemed to get worse, started a week later because it  was getting disconcerting to him so he couldn&#39;t sleep. Caller states it started 08Mar2021 and have had that on and off with Lyme. Caller states has struggled for years, is ongoing and is persisting. Caller states on 14Mar2021, he couldn&#39;t sleep, couldn&#39;t get out of bed, completely weak and dizzy, his left leg and quad was spasming like when he had Lyme&#39;s, left knee itches, tingles, and burns and that&#39;s where he got bit by the tick and that&#39;s when he had his symptoms when he was acute. Caller states it resolved within 3 weeks after the initial onset of the shot. Caller states when he had Lyme initially, that&#39;s what he experienced, his left knee swelled, burned and itched, his left knee cap. Caller states ended 17Apr2021. Caller states its a situation where some of those are still there because of Lyme and some are gone. Caller states the knee cap stuff and can&#39;t get out of bed was gone on 17Apr2021. Caller states he has recovered completely. Caller states he still is weak and dizzy and his left leg and quad are still spasming, but it&#39;s better and is improved. Caller states on 20Mar2021, his left knee cap hurt, was twitching and tight, his left toe was numb, felt like something is chewing on his toe with a sensation of worms under the skin and sleep disturbances. Caller verifies the sensation of worms under the skin and something chewing on his toe is all related to neuropathy, which is still there. Caller states he had written down that on 20Mar2021, he was supposed to get his second shot at 1800, but was denied due to side effects he was experiencing and was rescheduled for 31Mar2021 at a local high-risk clinic. Caller states on 22Mar2021, he slept good, but was fairly weak all day. caller states he took a shower mid-afternoon, and couldn&#39;t get off the couch. Caller states basically all he did was take a shower and threw himself on the cough the whole day. Caller states he has written that he has the sensation of ants crawling over the top of his back, no desires to go outside, and light sensitivity. Caller verifies the ants crawling over the top of his back was also neuropathy, and he recovered completely within 3 weeks. Light Sensitivity: Caller states throughout the whole thing, had it today and is still ongoing and persisting. Caller states began sometime in Mar2021, its been the whole time. Caller states 28Mar2021, he only slept 6 hours and woke up completely fatigued, could not get out of bed until 2:00 in the afternoon, has a complete loss of appetite, had a drink and 2 eggs and laid down, couldn&#39;t move until 1930. Caller states got up, had a nutrition shake, he wasn&#39;t desiring solid foods whatsoever, had 100% malaise, fatigue, no appetite, and was dizzy. Loss of appetite: Caller states he has lost 7 pounds since the first shot. Caller states he wasn&#39;t really interested in eating. Caller states he has a natural desire to eat and nothing sounded good. Caller states started Mar2021, is ongoing, and has improved. Caller states 31Mar2021, he got the second shot, he had a little bit of irritation, tingling and burning at site and definitely a flushed face throughout the day, almost like a sunburn. Caller states he was joking with clients and said the first shot killed him and the second shot cured him. caller states after the second shot, he is 80% better but can list the remaining symptoms. Caller states what he is left with is fatigue, he does not have any energy to do anything other than work, sleep issues, neuropathy, and dizziness. Dizziness: Caller states the dizziness has been consistent and goes with the sleeplessness, ongoing since Mar2021 and is persisting. Irritation, tingling, and burning at injection site: Caller verifies the irritation, tingling, and burning is at the injection site of the second dose. Caller states it happened within a few hours on 31Mar2021 and resolved within a week on or around 07Apr2021. Covid Vaccine: First Dose: Caller verifies he received the injection in his left arm around 1800. Caller unsure of NDC. Covid Vaccine: Second Dose: Caller verifies he received the second dose on 31 Mar2021. LOT: ER8730, Expiry Date: They didn&#39;t write that down so caller unsure. NDC: Caller unsure of NDC. Caller unsure of dosage given. Caller states was given via injection in his right arm around 1300 or 1330. Covid Vaccine: Indication: Caller states first off he owns a business, he did it to be responsible to the public. Caller states he wants his business to appear as safe and compliant as possible. Caller states he definitely was afraid because of the Lyme disease. Concomitant Products: Caller states he made sure he did nothing before purposefully. Test Results: Caller states after the first shot, he went to (Name) family physician, they did a lot of blood work trying to make sure his inflammatory markers weren&#39;t going up, to make sure he wouldn&#39;t have issues. Caller states the good news was he was great, everything looked normal, there was nothing crazy in the blood work. Caller states they though the shots would have triggered an autoimmune response of Lyme. Muscle/Joint: He reports a bit of muscular/joint pain in the area where the shot is, if he goes to reach  The outcome of the event &#34;itching, burning rashes, like a visible rash on his chest with raised bumps&#34;, &#34;headache&#34;, &#34;can&#39;t workout or walk&#34;, &#34;exhausted&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;immune system was on the edge of crashing&#34;, &#34;face was visibly red&#34; was resolved in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;debilitating malaise&#34; was resolved with Sequel in Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;Numb Extremities&#34; was resolved in 15Mar2021; the outcome of the event &#34;mouth sores&#34; was resolved in Apr2021, the outcome of the event &#34;face was flushed&#34; was resolved in 12Apr2021; the outcome of the event &#34;couldn&#39;t get out of bed&#34; &#34;left knee itches, tingles, and burns&#34; was resolved in 17Apr2021, the outcome of the event Back disorder was unknown, the outcome of the event &#34;complete loss of appetite&#34;, &#34;Joint Pain&#34;, &#34;Body Temperature Regulation Issues&#34;, &#34;barely has the amount of energy to work let alone the others/Weak&#34; was resolving, the outcome of the other events was not resolved.

                                                felt nauseous; face numb and tingling; face numb and tingling; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient reported himself) via Medical Information Team. A 53-year-old male consumer received first dose of (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection) via an unspecified route of administration on 21Apr2021 as single dose for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that, &#34;E-transmitting possible duplicate AE (this report may contain additional information not shared prior to transfer to the Medical Information. Caller stated he had already reported this to the previous agent). First dose of Pfizer on 21Apr2021, side effects started, 5 minutes after shot, felt nauseous. 10 minutes later, face numb and tingling and did not last long. He was no longer having side effects, they were all gone that day. He saw his PCP before the second dose and would talk to him&#34;. Caller asked whether the small side effects were from the first Pfizer vaccine, should he get the second. Response received included: As noted in the Fact Sheet for Recipients, should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine if he had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if he had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason could not be made by Pfizer. He was referred to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Healthcare provider would know his health situation and would have access to information that can better help inform this decision&#34;. No PQC present. Outcome of the events was recovered on 21Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                4/20/2021- I awoke to fatigue, nausea, and a 101.9 temperature. 4/23/2021- After seeing no signs of improvement, I visited my primary care physician, who had blood drawn for tests. Morning of 4/26/2021 ? I was contacted by my primary care physician?s office with results of the blood work. I was referred to a gastroenterologist due to critically high liver enzyme levels. My AST(ASGOT) was shown to be 825. Afternoon 4/26/2021: The gastroenterologist explained that my AST was roughly 40 times higher than normal. He said levels this high could not be caused by hepatitis A, B, C, or Auto-immune hepatitis. More blood was drawn at the gastroenterologist?s office. The results showed: Bilirubin Total of 2.2, Bilirubin Direct of 1.38, Alkaline Phosphate of 360, AST of 1,222, ALT of 2,314, Ferritin, Serum of 737. The gastroenterologist told me to go to the hospital if I developed jaundice or became too fatigued to get out of bed. 4/28/2021? CAT scan. Results were inconclusive. 5/2/2021- Developed jaundice.  I spoke with the gastroenterologist?s office and got appointment for 5/4/2021. The gastroenterologist changed his mind and had me admitted to hospital on 5/4/2021. While in the hospital blood was drawn frequently.  Peaks levels reached during the hospital stay were as follows: Bilirubin Total of 14.0, Bilirubin Direct of 11.53, Alkaline Phosphate of 346, AST of 1,522, ALT of 2,550. I had an ultrasound and endoscopy performed while in the hospital. The endoscopy looked at my bile duct, liver, and small intestine. Tissue was taken from the small intestine which ruled out celiac disease. Tissue was taken from my liver and biopsied.  The gastroenterologist said the liver appeared to have suffered medication induced hepatitis. He said, in his opinion this was caused by the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. At the time I was taking no other medicine other than a once a day multi-vitamin.  5/7/2021 I left hospital. 5/18/2021-Latest blood work results: Bilirubin Total of 14.7, Alkaline Phosphate of 369, AST of 268, ALT of 593. Future: I have an upcoming appointment with a hepatologist to determine extent of liver damage.

The reporter didn&#39;t know the lot number. The reporter called because last night (on 05Jun2021), at 09:00 PM, the patient was very tired and also had a bloody stool. The patient now hadn&#39;t gone to the bathroom again. Since that time, he hadn&#39;t had the bloody stool, but he got extremely exhausted after having the bloody stool. The reporter stated that the patient was a healthy person, so they needed to look out for any possible side effects once he got the vaccine. The reporter then added that&#39;s everything and they were just following up because the instructions that he was given was to reach out to the company if they had side effects and reiterated that the patient had exhausted and blood stool at 9 pm last night. The outcome of the events was unknown. Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Emergency services were called, and they took his vitals and said that everything was okay, but he was very agitated; reported as not like this prior to the vaccine. The patient was taken to urgent care where they gave him an unspecified steroid shot and unspecified medication for vomiting.

When the patient woke up, he was very restless (reported as: his body was just amped up and could not calm down). The patient calmed down just a little bit in the evening. When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

I lost 6 pounds.  After continuing with some diarrhea all day on February 12th, I began having bloody mucous chunks as my stool.  I was advised by my doctor to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

Once he received the vaccine he asked to use the bathroom and while he was in there he felt nauseous and came out of the bathroom. He then felt extremely light headed and nauseous that he almost collapsed to the floor. The pharmacist and myself (an immunizing pharmacy intern) rushed to check on him. He reported a little difficulty breathing but was still conscious. We proceeded to call 911 and gave one dose of 0.3 mg Epi-pen. After about 5 minutes he felt much better and was able to sit up. He reported that he never lost complete consciousness but was extremely nauseous and lightheaded. Patient handed over to EMS.

I tried to make it back to my bed, but fell twice.  The second time I fell I stayed on the ground for about 5 minutes.  When I got up, everything was back to normal.  I left soon after to the Hospital emergency room to get checked.

At least I know my body is doing what it is supposed to be doing. But it is just miserable. Massive headache, soreness, weird shooting pains in my leg, sweats and chills and nausea, and now the racing heart and shortness of breath.

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Drove to vaccination site. Had a coffee and muffin on way down; had a coffee and veggie wrap on drive back.  Once back home and at my computer for day, room started spinning - I made it outside to back porch, then vomited all food and liquid from the morning. I could not stand - felt like a giant hand was pushing me down - so I laid on my back porch for several hours. When I did stand up, the vertigo (dizziness and nausea) was immense. Made it to couch inside and toward evening gradually made it to bed upstairs, crawling part of the way. By the next morning the  spinning still present but about 50 percent less. Better if I kept eyes shut; spinning and nausea if I opened them. This eventually subsided later in day - I was able to hold down crackers and ginger ale.  By the following day (Wed.) I was able to work - the room spinning and dizziness was finally gone. And by this point able to hold down food and liquids.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021450744 same patient/SD, different AE/dose

Denies cough, dyspnea, fevers. Reporting he has had 1 round of COVID vaccines. Has taken &#34;alieve, tylenol, and advil&#34; w/o relief. Last doses all &#34;early this morning.&#34; pt awake and alert in triage.   History of Present Illness     Patient is a 54 y.o. yo male presenting to the ED with severe headache behind the right ear since 4/30.  Patient was diagnosed with Covid at that time and has taken 1 round of the Covid vaccine.  He has tried Aleve, Tylenol and Advil without relief.  He states that his last dose were all early this morning.  Denies any numbness or tingling, visual disturbances, ataxia, photophobia.  He has no history of strokes, MI or blood clots.  He states that prior to his Covid diagnosis he is otherwise healthy. ED Discharged  5/8/2021 (4 hours)  Last attending ? Treatment team COVID-19 Clinical impression Fever Chief complaint   Medical Decision Making     54-year-old male who presents today due to uncontrolled fever, diagnosed with Covid on April 30.  Symptomatic for about 2 weeks now.  On exam appears to be uncomfortable, is febrile and tachycardic, however remaining vitals are stable.  Physical exam is also reassuring.  Patient not complaining of any chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness.  Will provide patient with symptomatic relief including fluids and ibuprofen, if able to improve patient&#39;s symptomatology will have him discharged home.  His labs also show some slight hyponatremia, he will likely improve from fluids as I believe this is secondary to his diarrhea that he has been having over the last few days.  CK also slightly elevated, would likely benefit from fluids.   After a single liter of fluids, patient symptoms improved, fever and tachycardia also improved, continues to endorse some generalized weakness, will give second liter of fluid and Tylenol at this time as he is due for this.   After receiving a second liter, the patient states that his symptoms have greatly improved at this time, comfortable returning home.  I advised the patient that she should take ibuprofen and Tylenol on 6-hour cycles very regularly, he can take it in a pattern where he takes Tylenol followed by ibuprofen 3 hours later followed by Tylenol again 3 hours later, as long as he keeps 6 hours in between doses, explained to him that he should not take this any sooner than this however he should be sure to take these regularly as these will help control his fever.  Also encouraged him to hydrate appropriately as this will likely prevent him from feeling poorly.  He is agreeable with this plan, I provided him with appropriate return precautions.

He had seen three doctors, tested negative to Covid-19 and his blood tests were normal. He had flu like symptoms for 13 days since 23Apr2021, and it never goes away. The symptoms seem to get better and then he exercises a lot and they come back. Patient has been nauseated, had extreme lethargy, sadness and depression, and body aches. The patient was on a plethora of medications now because of this. He wanted to know what does it say about his immune system? He was scared that he was dying, it feels like he&#39;s dying. He has worn two masks and not socialized at all and does not understand what has happened, he has done everything right. His inflammatory response was checked on 04May2021 which has not come back yet. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: normal on 06May2021, body height: 175 cm on 06May2021, platelet count: normal on 04May2021, red blood cell count: normal   on 04May2021, sars-cov-2 test: negative on 04May2021, weight: 195-200 on 06May2021.

                                                Diffuse abdominal pain onset approximately 10-12 hr post dose.  I was initially awoken that first night with nausea and abdominal pain. This continued through 1/22/21. My nausea had subsided and I was able to eat in small quantities. My abdomen felt bloat with mild distention. The AM of 1/23/21, I awoke and the diffuse abdominal pain had abated. I was left with RLQ abdominal pinpoint pain. This became progressively worse throughout the day. I presented to the ER on 1/23/21. Chem panel was normal. CBC also normal.   I received an abdominal CT scan with IV contrast for R/O appy. My appendix was normal. The scan revealed a serosal venous thrombophlebitis wth inflammation in the mesentery and transverse colitis.  The pain continued to progress, so I presented to the ER again on 1/25/21.  I received another abdominal CT along with additional lab work.  Lactate normal. D-Dimer mildly elevated at 0.7 and CRP was 9.7. Again CBC was normal. This CT did not reveal the micro-emboli or colits but rather omental inflammation.  At this point, surgery was consulted along with hematology for opinion regarding anticoagulation. The decision to anti coagulate was deferred. The diagnosis I received was omental infarct.  I remain on pain medications and continue to monitor for changes in my pain and a fever.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3246), intramuscular on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 12Jan2021, the evening after the vaccine was administered, the patient experienced chills, bone aches, and minor HA that then worsened to explosive diarrhea and violent vomiting with a jaundice color of skin. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                2/2/2021- seen in Ed with c/o intermittent fever following 2nd dose.  Redness to bilateral upper extremities, c/o some pain with urination, weak.  V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.  RADIOLOGY DIAGNOSTIC - CHEST PORTABLE 02/04 2051 *** Report Impression - Status: SIGNED  Entered: 02/04/2021 2059 IMPRESSION: 1.

Ill-defined patchy opacities within the bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, in consolidative opacities within bilateral lower lobes which could represent aspiration, and/or multifocal pneumonia. 2. Small right trace left pleural effusions. 3. Diffusely dilated small bowel without a transition point and mucosal hyperenhancement involving the colon with areas of pneumatosis involving loops of small bowel within the left upper quadrant and portal venous air consistent with hypoperfusion complex. There is a small caliber appearance of the aorta and a flattened appearance of the IVC is well. 4. Intravascular air within the IVC and bilateral iliac veins could be secondary to right femoral central lying injection. 5. Somewhat abnormal enhancement pattern of the kidneys with hypoenhancement of the medullary pyramids which may suggest hypoperfusion injury as well. 6.

                                                about 36 hours after injection, after waking up, I had vertigo/dizzy spells when changing positions. These lasted over 24 hours depending on activity (which was not much as the early bouts were nauseating). In subsequent days, the dizziness has subsided to much more tolerable levels but still present after waking up or changing from laying down to standing up.

                                                Approximately 20 minutes of receiving the first dose of Pfizer COVIN19 vaccine, I started to develop a metallic taste in my mouth.  Shortly after the metallic taste started, saliva production decreased causing severe dry mouth and it became difficult to swallow.  I went to the closest hospital which was approximately a 10 minute drive from when symptoms started and explained what was going on to the person at the triage desk.  I did NOT request to be seen by a doctor because symptoms had started to lesson but I did wait at the ER since it was a public place for approximately 30 minutes before traveling home.  Approximately 2 hours after onset of symptoms, saliva production had returned to normal levels.

But that 2nd day after, G.I. issues began middle of nite. So fatigued &amp; short-of-breath, barely made it to dialysis, where they put me on oxygen. All during treatment, BP fluctuated 90-170, temp 96-101, chills (shivering!), continued fatigue &amp; weakness, even after leaving - they wanted to give me antibiotics &amp; send me to e.r.!!! Staff did collect blood sample for culture (result in 24 hrs &#43; neg). I refused antibiotics and e.r., convinced it was vax reaction, and I was right, all normal another day later.  Anxious bout 2nd shot ??

I arrived in time for what I thought was a 12:15 appointment but ended up standing in line for an hour before actually getting the shot.  I was fine the rest of that day aside from developing soreness in the muscles of my right arm.  The following morning, Wednesday, April 14th,  I was awakened to very noticeable soreness in both arms and the back of my neck. As the morning progressed, I developed flu-like symptoms, complete body aches, chills, fever, slight nausea, blurred vision, mild diarrhea.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room.

A 55-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number, Expiration date, NDC and UPC number was unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 06Jun2021 at 11:30 hours as 1st dose, single dose (at the age of 55-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Regarding lot number patient stated that it looks like EW, patient thought he was not sure if it was 6185 or 0185, not sure it looks like 0 but it looks like 6 too but patient think it was 0. The patient medical history included shortness of breath, sleep apnea and kidney disease (from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing). Patient sees a doctor for lot of conditions one was for shortness of breath and sleep apnea and sees a neurologist for Bph. The patient concomitant medications were not reported. Patient explained he was reluctant from getting vaccinated and nervous before the shot. On 06Jun2021, after patient took the shot, probably around 11:30 in the morning, patient was same, soon after 5 min maybe more, patient got a sensation on the left side of his tongue 5-10 mins, then  kind of a weird taste came to his mouth, patient started to get a little dizzy, a little light headedness, weakness in his chest and both his arms, got shortness of breath but had been seeing a doctor for shortness of breath prior taking the Covid shot and had kind of reluctant of taking the shot but some other issues going on side,  patient decided to take it, a couple of hours after the shot, patient had a headache, had the diarrhea. Patient described the weird taste like having a penny in his mouth. Patient explained he consulted a doctor on that Monday (07Jun2021), who said she encountered patients who also had the sensation on their tongues following vaccination, and that it was normal. Today (08Jun2021) patient had feeling just a little bit of nausea and patient kind a feel like a little brain fog, it was just his head doesn&#39;t feel right, the major concern was says some things risks factors and some of them had severe reactions, patient had a reaction difficulty in breathing, dizziness and feel little bit weakness, patient kind of a felt like his throat was going to close and he won&#39;t say he had any difficulty in swallowing, but it was not normal. Patient developed symptoms which spooked and scared him. Patient did not have his lab test but was constantly going to patient had just had right heart catheter right two weeks ago, you know last for him, patient was supposed to take another lab test to conduct at the end of the month for cholesterol, but patient saw neurologist for kidney disease. Events did not improve, patient just had this brain fog you know. Patient had to call a doctor after he got home, they did not prescribe him anything, patient mean he did bunch of appointment with doctor with the phone as soon as he got home from taken a Covid shot he was little worried. Patient stated he was concerned about getting the second dose of vaccine scheduled on 27Jun2021. Patient stated he will not be able to consult his doctor before the vaccination appointment and was not able to get further assistance from a pharmacist. Patient repeated he does not know what to do about the second dose. Patient was kind of reluctant taking the next shot, if he was going to feel the something like this again, he don&#39;t want to, as he already had uneasy you know just had and patient did not had difficulty in breathing all of time this comes and go,  from the sentence he described it says on pamphlet that there was severe reaction to the shot and don&#39;t want to take the second shot and then end up in hospital because patient had more from it so his question was he was afraid to take the second shot. Patient don&#39;t had answer to that he means he would like to talk to somebody who can give him information kind of help me to relax little bit if it was normal and in in response it was responded that decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by the company. Patient was referred to speak to his healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection, as healthcare provider knows his health situation and had access to information that can better help inform this decision. The outcome of brain fog was not recovered and outcome for other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number is requested.

I also developed upset stomach , but that one went away.  The dizziness continued into the second dose and still continues.  The second dose is EP 7533.  I still get dizzy when i lay down and when get up, then it sort of normalizes, but when i lay down flat back and head up, dizziness starts.  I have to be careful when i get out of bed and have to wait until i gain my balance back.

Treatment with OTC Loperamide provided only moderate relief for short periods of time..  Followed normal hydration recommendations to prevent dehydration.  Nausea and stomach cramping started approximately 24 hours after administration and continue up to time of this report.  Treatment of stomach cramping with Dicyclomine prescribed by GI for previous issues due to Crohn&#39;s Disease provided only moderate relief.  Nausea untreated.   Combination of symptoms led to anorexia  and I am only able to tolerate small amounts of  foods such as broth.  GI doctor was contacted on 6/23/2021 and informed of symptoms with the objective of being prescribed stronger medications to control them.  As of this report I have not received notification of any medications prescribed and awaiting me at pharmacy.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

                                                Patient presented to physical therapy on 03/19/2021 for routine therapy follow-up visit.  Patient reported prior to the start of the session he received his first COVID vaccine on 03/16/2021 and the proceeding 24-48 hours following had nausea, diarrhea, fever, and increased redness, swelling, and warmth of the right arm.  Patient had a recent right shoulder surgery and received his injection in the surgical arm.  Comparing his arm from Monday&#39;s visit to when he presented on Friday there was a significant change around his incision with increased redness, warmth, and firmness of his arm tissue.  Call was placed immediately to patient&#39;s surgeon office and patient was seen later in the day by his surgeon for further follow-up.  Therapy was put on hold for the day.   Patient seen by surgeon 3/19/2021, arm warm to the touch so oral antibiotics started. Unsure if related to covid vaccine. Patient seen again 3/19/2021, still some warmth to mid humerus area and swelling that has been present since surgery. No active infection noted.

However, several weeks later and now 4 weeks later, I have had consistent, daily lower digestive issues including irregular and incomplete bowel movements, and low level cramps throughout the day.   I had NONE of this prior to getting the vaccine.   I would consider it to be specific to me, but my wife had reported similar symptons when she received the Pfizer vaccine several months earlier (she&#39;s a nurse so was able to get the vaccine sooner) and they last 10 weeks and she went to the doctor.   She was told by the doctor she is &#34;not the first person&#34; he&#39;s heard this complaint from.

He can&#39;t take a multivitamin or supplements because he would get sick to his stomach, this was before the vaccine. He was getting that same sick feeling now that he would get if he was taking a multivitamin. He had his blood drawn a week before he had the vaccine to check his kidneys with the pills he is on. It was perfect and normal, and he has had nothing since then. In his 20s he had the flu vaccine, and he had never had the flu in his life. That year he got the worse flu sick of his life. He never got the flu vaccine or other vaccines after that. That was probably between 1987 to 1990. His folks passed away. He had been in the hospital when he was little.Concomitant medications included acetaminophen taken for back pain, sciatica from an unspecified start date and ongoing; nabumetone taken for sciatica, back pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing.

Patient got sick around 10:00 at night. He was supposed to get his second dose but he was so sick and they said lets give it a week. Then he talked to his doctor and he said to wait 2-3 weeks to make sure he is back to normal. So he is scheduled for the second dose next week at 6 weeks. He asked if it was okay that the shot was given in the sunlight. He stated that he saw that it was in an ice chest but the person had to walk it over to him 20 feet and deal with his sleeve for a second or two so it was in the sun. He said all that walking it was 100% in the sun and he has read that it should not be in the sun. He asked if this could have caused bacteria and caused his symptoms. He stated his doctor was only concerned about giving him antibiotics for bacteria if it was in the sun and if that was a problem. He just read from CDC, once mixed the vaccine can be left at room temp for 6 hours and mixed vaccine does not need to be protected from light. So it sounds like his first shot was good. He had gotten the shot at about 1430 in the afternoon. He was like he is going to get the shot and everything will be great. He didn&#39;t think there would be an effect. Then strangely enough at about 2200 he was about to eat dinner and he got to not feeling good in his stomach. It had been close to 8 hours. The next day he slept all day, got up and had coffee, and Saturday he was in the chair in the living room. He is never in the chair during the day because he works. He slept all day and all night and the next day. He was responding strangely to people, and he was in and out of it. He had the shot on Wednesday and then his stomach was feeling sick and his body was hurting. He has back pain anyway and bone spurs on his spine. He was telling his wife whatever pain he is normally in was enhanced. His whole torso hurt and his stomach. The following Monday he had diarrhea. Then he started getting really irritable and didn&#39;t want to talk and was impatient. He was lethargic and had no energy. That was the second week. By the end of the second week he had a couple pains in the left chest area behind the breast. He thought it was a heart attack, then thought it was just pain not a heart attack. Every time he wouldn&#39;t feel good he would start breathing hard. Once in a while he gets pain through his chest area. His stomach would start and he would breath hard every time he didn&#39;t feel good. The third week he was supposed to get the second shot. He called the department of health for New Mexico. The nurse called back and said not to do the shot that week but to wait a week. He rescheduled for a week later. By the third week he was still not feeling good and called the doctor. He asked about the pain in his chest 3 times and he said it seemed to be okay. His arm started hurting where he got the shot in the second week. He still had no energy and he told the doctor this. Patient started taking 2 extra Tylenol during the day for pain. Lately he has been good until one little thing and then all of a sudden his stomach is hurting and he is holding his stomach. He was good today, all he did was eat a cookie and he didn&#39;t get sick. He was worse for a little while in the first or second week, he was really bad. It came and went over the next 2 weeks and now it is coming and going less frequently. He slept through 2 or 3 days. Thursday, Friday, and then Saturday he was in and out. He woke up to take the garbage out on Friday then saw he already took it out and forgot it was out there. And it was Saturday. He was kind of out of it. When he would respond strangely he would respond with a question he just asked and someone answered. It is like brain fog or like he is on something. It started after the weekend, more on 12Apr2021. Once in a while he will forget a little something still, but just once in a while. He would walk and hold his rib cage with both arms when he was hurting. He wrote down that it felt like somebody had hit him in the back with a bat in the lower back. One day it was that bad. His back pain was on Thursday 15Apr2021. The pain now is not like where it hit him with the back. He has back pain every day but more than he used to. The sore like he was hit in the back pain was just the one day. He had diarrhea 12Apr2021, 13Apr2021, and 14Apr2021 then it left for probably a week. Then it came back last week one day. Instead of every day it was every 3 or 4 days. He has not had it in the last 4 days. He hopes it is done. He noticed any time he has salad or lettuce he feels bad in the morning so he stopped eating those. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. He felt irritable more when he started not feeling good. The last 5 days or so more towards the evening at 1800 or 1900 he starts not feeling good and gets irritated. His wife will ask him something and he gets really short and impatient. The irritable feeling started right away the Friday of the week he got the shot. He is still struggling some, it will come and go. Yesterday he was zonked. With having no energy it is a big thing. He has to do something instead of what he would be doing. He works all day and takes long orders and stuff. Now he does like one order when normally he did 10. One for him is a huge little sore so he will lay on his right side. His left arm still hurts like a pulling hurt from his neck to his arm. It has been every day from 13Apr2021. It is much better and he will move and it will relax a little bit. It was really weird. The whole time he held the phone with his left hand up until one second he moved his phone and it was the same pain. At night the left side where he had the injection pulls on his neck muscle coming from his arm. He was actually taking two Tylenol in the morning and two at night when he went to bed. With the pain he takes 2 during the day, 650mg each. He was just taking 500mg and then his wife said take these. It seems to have gotten a little better. He always took them 2 times a day and now he takes them 3 times a day. After the first dose he experienced difficulty breathing dizziness, weakness, a fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, headache, he passed out for 2 days and has been sick for 5 weeks. He started having some dizziness a couple of days later and reports, it&#39;s like I would stand up too quickly and get a head rush, that kind of dizzy feeling. He confirmed that his dizziness did not start until a couple of days after he received his first dose.

                                                About 16 days after the 2nd shot, I began feeling very tired, fatigued, nauseous, and had a headache.  About 18 days after the shot, I still had the same symptoms but also developed a red rash on my left upper bac, left arm, and left shin.  The rash was painful and burned.  When touched, I could feel the pain shoot through my nerves.  I was seen by the PA referenced above, who treated it as shingles, but diagnosed it as a plant based reaction, as he could not be sure it was shingles.  I was prescribed Mupirocin and valACYclovir HCI.  I still had the fatigue and nausea for several days after starting the medication.  Despite receiving my 2 shingles vaccinations in September and December of 2020, it appears the Pfizer vaccine may have triggered a mild case of shingles.

Four day later I went to an urgent care for treatment for nausea and the headache.  Two days later I was in the emergency room in the Medical Center for treatment of the same symptoms.  Eventually the headache got better so I could function but I was very lethargic and had a constant cough for the next 6-7 weeks.

                                                Experienced a delayed reaction to vaccine that occurred at 11 p. m.  Administration was at 8:23 a. m. earlier in the day.  Symptoms began as build up of mucous in back of throat and reflux. Very early the next morning symptoms progressed to near inability to swallow,    Took 50 mg of Benadryl which gave a bit of relief.  Very hard to drink the water and get it down with the two pills.  The symptoms included swollen lips and inside of the mouth swelling.  Went to the emergency room at the Clinic  at 7:30 a. m.   I was given 60 mg of Prednisone, Pepsid to coat the stomach re the steroids. Was sent home with prescription for epi pen, medrol dose pack, Pepsid and Zyrtec.  Symptoms improved except for swelling of lips.  However, on 3/11/21, despite taking the medication, the symptoms worsened in terms of renewed lip swell as well as new symptoms of facial flushing and chest flushing.  Symptoms then abated with medication.  On 3/13/21, symptoms flared again with renewed lip swelling, inside and outside check swelling and outside face and chest flushing.  They they abated again with medication.  On 3/14/21, lip swelling renewed as a symptom.  To date, my lips do not feel right but tingly and bloated and irritated.  Saw an allergist this morning who thinks I am allergic to polyglycol a preservative in the vaccine.

Patient and woke up in the early morning hours of 3/12/21 to use the restroom.  While urinating, he became very dizzy and nauseated and had a sense like he needed to lay down to rest.  Other than nausea he did not have any other symptoms.  He returned to his bed and fell upon his wife and had decreased level of consciousness but without total loss of consciousness (he was able to hear his wife talking to him but was unable to respond).  This lasted about a minute and slowly he came back to his senses.  After this he felt quite cold and did have some shaking but is not clear whether these were true rigors.  He did not have any preceding fevers nor did he have any fevers in the emergency room.  After about 5-10 minutes he was feeling back to his normal self but want to come into the hospital to get checked out.   He has never had anything like this before.The patient has had chest pressure since his COVID vaccine which he had on Wednesday.  This is been intermittent, mostly positional and better with laying on his side and leaning forward, worse with recumbency.  It is not pleuritic in nature.  No associated shortness of breath.  No other fevers chills sweats.  No sick contacts.   Evaluation in the emergency room was done and a CT scan was done and no pulmonary embolus was found.  No parenchymal abnormalities.  The patient&#39;s pleural effusions remain, and her mildly worsened, personally reviewed. Baseline labs were unremarkable for anemia, kidney injury.EKG personally reviewed, normal sinus rhythm. High sensitivity troponin was done and negative.  Family otherwise feels well, no sick contacts, eating well no nausea vomiting diarrhea blood in his stool.   Pt admitted for observation. Continued to feel well VSS, ekg stable, ECHO without acute findings (see below), UA neg, cardiac monitoring uneventful, orthostatics negative, walking in halls and eating well. Appears to have had vaso vagal episode. Will be getting routine head imaging in the coming month with cancer history   See below testing     Care plan upon discharge &gt; To call if any return of symptoms &gt; To hold metformin until Monday due to recent dye load &gt; Blood cultures  Pending, low clinical suspicion   &gt; To change H2 blocker to PPI due to GERD on 3 month esophagram &gt; Follow up in clinic when return from break &gt; Dr discussing with pulmonary team most recent CT (see below) and treatment plan moving forward   Brief exam: awake, alert, oriented, not in any distress. PERRL, EMOI, tongue midline. Upper and lower extremities at full strength 5/5 in the arms, hands, dorsi flex and flexion at the ankles, knees and legs. Sensation not tested.    Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

                                                Approximately 1-2 minutes after injection, my throat began to close and I was having difficulty breathing and speaking. Dizziness followed. I told the attendant that I needed help. They knew that I had my epipen with me. From that time on, all I recall was asking someone to use the pen. An employee successfully administered the epipen. I was then placed on the floor with my head raised as I could no longer swallow or breathe. All that I can recall from that point was speaking with paramedics at the CVS and was feeling successful results from the epi pen. I was taken to Rockledge Medical ER where they took me in immediately and administered steroids and other antihistamines.

The patient was on oxygen at the time of reporting. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose for the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was unknown.The reporter did not provide causality for the event of COVID-19 pneumonia. Follow-up information was received as solicited report on 15Apr2021 from a consumer via (pharmacy name). On 06Apr2021, the patient had pneumonia (pneumonia, medically significant and hospitalized). Additional lot number and expiration date were added to 2.5 mg concentration of PO Orenitram. On 06Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 6 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalized due to pneumonia and remained hospitalized at the time of reporting. The patient was also hospitalized in Mar2021 for COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Action taken with PO Orenitram dose for the event of pneumonia was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the event of pneumonia was unknown. The reporter did not provide causality for the event of pneumonia. Additional spontaneous information was received on 19Apr2021 from a consumer (social worker) via (pharmacy name). Event of pneumonia was omitted and subsumed under COVID-19 pneumonia. Since 06Apr2021, the patient remained hospitalized due to COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia). Follow-up information was received on 27Apr2021, from a nurse on behalf of the reporting physician via a query response. On 16Apr2021, the patient had acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID, AHRF secondary to Influenza B exacerbating PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (acute respiratory failure, hospitalized, medically significant), pulmonary hypertension (pHTN) exacerbation, AHRF (acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, pHTN treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus (pulmonary arterial hypertension, hospitalized and medically significant), AHRF secondary to Flu B and PAH with baseline PAH (influenza, hospitalized), volume overload (fluid overload, hospitalized). On an unreported date in 2021, the patient had fever, temperature 101.1 F (pyrexia). On an unreported date, the patient had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) (mitral valve incompetence, medically significant), steroid induced diabetes (steroid diabetes, medically significant), lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs (oedema peripheral), weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs (weight fluctuation), rash (rash), diarrhea (diarrhoea), and leg healing (limb discomfort). On 16Apr2021, 1 year 8 months 16 days after initiating PO Orenitram, the patient was hospitalised due to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) from COVID (previously reported COVID-19 pneumonia) and for AHRF secondary to influenza B exacerbating PAH, then transferred to the other hospital with volume overload and diuresis. The patient was presented with volume overload and needed oxygen requirement (none needed at home prior to both hospitalizations). The patient&#39;s breathing and oxygen were improved with diuresis. Patient&#39;s pulmonary hypertension was treated with steroids as though to be flare due to lupus. Patient was given intravenous (IV) solumedrol (25 mg in AM and 16 mg in PM) as per the discussion with rheumatology and pulmonary hypertension cardiology with improvement in oxygen status. On 24Apr2021, the patient relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included: complete blood count (CBC) WBC (white blood count) 4.79, RBC (Red blood cell count) 3.31, Hgb (hemoglobin) 8.4, Plt (Platelet count) 146. Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) Na (sodium) 141, K (potassium) 4.1, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 39, Creatinine 1.68, glucose 90. On 25Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.51, RBC 3.24, Hgb 8.2, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 39, Creatinine 1.59, glucose 117. On 26Apr2021, the patient had relevant diagnostic and laboratory test included WBC 5.41, RBC 3.30, hgb 8.3, Plt 159. Na 141, K 4.4, BUN 37, creatinine 1.54, and glucose 90. The patient was discharged on 26Apr2021. Patient&#39;s physical exam at the time of discharge showed pulse 65 bpm, respiratory rate 18 per minute, blood pressure (BP) 138/78 mmHg, temperature 36.5 °C and weight was 90.9 kg. The patient was breathing comfortably in no distress on 2 Litre nasal cannula (NC). Minimal crackles appreciated in the morning posteriorly. The patient had 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs and edema unchanged but overall leg size decreased. Continues to be pitting but improved on the day of discharge. Patient&#39;s discharge diagnosis pulmonary hypertension exacerbation. Patient&#39;s diuretics were increased from 40 mg daily to 60 mg daily and may needed more diuretics. Discharge medications included: Protonix (pantoprazole), Demadex (torsemide), Medrol (methylprednisolone), Citracal &#43; d (calcium citrate, ergocalciferol), Lanoxin (digoxin), Epipen (epinephrine), Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate), Folvite (folic acid), Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine sulfate). Patient&#39;s medications of Pepcid, Lasix, and Aldactone were stopped after discharge from the hospital. The patient was instructed to take pantoprazole 40 mg daily while on steroids and when steroids tapered, he had to discontinue it in future and would stop pantoprazole and resume taking home dose of famotidine. Patient was on nifedipine at home and physician thought to be the contributing factor to lower extremity edema so stopped taking the nifedipine in house. It was reported that steroid induced the diabetes. It was reported that the patient needs transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) due to had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation) but not agreeable at that time. The patient tried ethacrynic acid 50 mg daily but felt it was not making a difference with his weight. The patient went back on the Bumex (bumetanide) on Friday. Patient&#39;s weight slowly coming down to see doing good later on Bumex, his rash subsiding and leg was healing. Patient&#39;s weight was stable at 155 lbs and had multifactorial stable shortness of breath (SOB). Patient&#39;s weight was above baseline and needed more diuretics. Patient had been in touch with his COVID positive brother who was symptomatic and refused to be covid testing quarantining at that time. On 24Feb2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 °F in 2021. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, CI 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID-19 swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight in Apr 2021 since discharge from the hospital. Action taken with PO Orenitram dose due to the event of COVID-19 pneumonia was updated to dose decreased and for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. Action taken with nifedipine, and Medrol dose for the events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia diarrhoea and limb discomfort was not reported. At the time of reporting, the outcome of the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events of rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events of pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unreported date in 2021. The reporter did not provide causality for the events of acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation, rash, pyrexia, diarrhoea, and limb discomfort. Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia, and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded. Pfizer is a marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] in the country of incidence or the country where the product was purchased (if different). This may be a duplicate report if another marketing authorization holder of [Nifedipine] has submitted the same report to the regulatory authorities. Information on the batch/Lot number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association and the known safety profile, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 to the development of drug ineffective, COVID-19, pneumonia, rash, pyrexia and diarrhoea cannot be excluded. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure was secondary to COVID-19, therefore was also considered as related to BNT162B2. The other events were considered as due to underlying or intercurrent conditions and unrelated to BNT162B2. Steroid diabetes was considered as related to methylprednisolone and other events were unrelated to methylprednisolone. Oedema peripheral and limb discomfort were considered as related to nifedipine and other events were unrelated to nifedipine. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

In 2021, the patient got his first dose of COVID-19 vaccine and his temperature was 101.1 F. The patient would take Tylenol (paracetamol) and monitor if fever persists to 48 hours he would go to the urgent care. Patient was started on Eliquis and felt much better and no longer to had temperatures and diarrhea. On an 21Apr2021, the patient had right heart catheterization which revealed moderate pulmonary hypertension with right atrium (RA) 7, right ventricle (RV) 12, pressure wave (PW) 15, PA 62/ 25/40, PA saturation 63 %, CO 7, ci 3.52. Patient had chronically high PAD&#39;s and could not take metolazone secondary to hypercalcemia and pending admission for colonoscopy with the physician. Patient reminded multiple times by physician for getting a COVID swab. The patient also had increased 4 lb weight since discharge from the hospital. In 2021, the patient experienced had fever, temperature 101.1 F. On an unknown date, the patient experienced had worsening MR (mitral regurgitation), steroid induced diabetes, lower extremity edema, 2&#43; pitting edema, to knees 1&#43; dependent edema at thighs, weight slowly coming down, weight up 4 lbs, rash, diarrhea, and leg healing (limb discomfort). In 2021, patient weight was up by 4 lbs since discharge from hospital. The action for nifedipine in response to the events was unknown. The action for methylprednisolone in response to the events was unknown. The action for treprostinil diolamin in response to the events was unknown. The outcome of the events COVID-19 pneumonia, drug ineffective, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, steroid diabetes, oedema peripheral, weight fluctuation was unknown. The outcome of the events rash and limb discomfort was recovering. The outcome of the events pyrexia and diarrhoea was recovered on an unknown date in 2021.  Case Comment/Senders Comment: The company has assessed the serious adverse events of COVID-19 pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension, influenza, fluid overload, mitral valve incompetence, and steroid diabetes as not related to Orenitram. The event of COVID-19 pneumonia was related to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the event influenza was related to seasonal Influenza B. The event acute respiratory failure was likely related to acute influenza, but was also possibly impacted by pulmonary insult from COVID-19 pneumonia , and underlying lupus associated with PAH. The event pulmonary arterial hypertension was likely an exacerbation of the underlying PAH due to the concurrent infections. The event mitral valve incompetence and fluid overload were likely related to cardiac dysfunction associated with the underlying chronic and progressive PAH. The event steroid diabetes was likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus, although co-suspect medication nifedipine was possibly contributory to the event in view of its safety profile and as such cannot be excluded.  The reporter&#39;s assessment of the causal relationship of the event with the suspect product was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the consistency with the known safety profile of the suspect product BNT162B2, events of COVID-19 pneumonia, Drug ineffective, Fever, Diarrhea could be related to the suspected drug of BNT162B2. All the other events are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drug.  The reported events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Nifedipine.  The events of Diabetes steroid-induced is most likely related to co-suspect medication Medrol, which was used as treatment for the lupus. All the other events are considered unlikely related to the suspected drug of Medrol.   Medical history of ongoing Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH/ High BP disorder/ increased pressure of pulmonary circulation), ongoing Systemic lupus erythematosus, and ongoing Dyspnoea may provide explanations for some of the events (such as Pulmonary arterial hypertension, Volume overload, Mitral regurgitation, and Oedema peripheral).   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Most problematic has been the re-emergence of a long dormant auto-immune disorder (12&#43; yrs), bullous pemphigus. This disorder, when active, causes blistering and sloughing skin in soft tissue areas. It can be very painful and uncomfortable. It usually emerges when I have a significant event that causes my immune system to plummet. I fully believe this vaccine precipitated this occurrence.

Medical history included high cholesterol, blood pressure abnormal, degenerative arthritis and allergies to penicillin and NSAIDS. Concomitant medications included gabapentin, lisinopril, levothyroxine and atorvastatin. On days 1-4, the patient experienced significant fatigue and headache on 15Jan2021. On days 5-8, there was intense GI distress with stabbing stomach pain, following these events has been continued with fatigue and general malaise. Most problematic was activation of a long dormant (over 12 years) auto-immune disorder, bullous pemphigus, which attacks soft tissue areas on the body with blisters and sloughing skin. This is a very uncomfortable experience to go through. The patient&#39;s healthcare provider is aware and treating him for such. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 25Jan2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of day 1-4 was significant fatigue and headache, day 5-8 was intense gi distress with stabbing stomach pain and general malaise. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

                                                First started feeling upset stomach and severe headache, then a couple hours later, the body aches and joint pain set in. He said his lower body felt like he&#39;d been in a car accident. He couldn&#39;t keep anything down to take pain medicine all day long so was miserable all day until about 4pm when he was able to drink some water and take some Vicodin, which did not help. He was up and down all night long with the headache and body aches, and I gave him Excedrin about 6am and that finally started alleviating the headache. He took it again at 11am and was able to eat then, and is gradually been feeling better throughout the day. He was finally able to take his regular meds so now the body aches have subsided (48 hours after injection/36 hours after onset of symptoms).

Lasted 3 solid, then fever began to drop day 4, but headache persisted along with sweats and violent chill. No real appetite.  Also experienced body ache, but not as bad as other symptoms.  No, or little bowel movement during this time.  On day five (today) urine output is dark, but went 18 hours without Tylenol.  Piot to that i need 2 extra strength Tylenol every 5 hours for 4 days straight.  No nausea or vomiting associated with any of this.  I have extreme fatigue due the extreme headache pain keeping me awake.  Headache on the left and right side of the head, not front or behine the eyes, more over the ears.  Today I just feel wiped out by it all, but much improved.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccines previously, including allergy, flu, shingles and pneumonia.

These symptoms were severe, much worse than when I had the virus in December. I thought I was having a stroke and was minutes away from dialing 911.

He swallowed a few times but was difficult to do so.  It then eased up and then 30 minutes later when he was getting up to leave he was light headed.  He walked out and got to the car, came home and still felt a little light headed, sat around for a couple of hours and was doing better.  He went outside to do a few things and was stumbling around and went back into the house.  He went to take a shower and still had the bandaide on his arm, took the bandaide off and while driving off he saw that he had a rash the size of a 50 cent piece around 7:30.  He got up the next morning and the rash was gone, the dizziness was gone and everything was fine.  He did not take anything for his reaction.

                                                Excruciating pain in ALL o my body.  The vaccine has triggered a Fibromyalgia episode from hell.  Extreme pain in ALL of my body.  It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

                                                I had to be taken via ambulance to the E/R Hospital, .   - After 10 days of excruciating pain, I had to be taken to the E/R.  I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

                                                I was vaccinated at the pharmacy with the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on 4/6/2021.  I woke on 4/7/2021 with every nerve in my body on fire! It&#39;s been that way ever since. . .    I have real bad Fibromyalgia for over 25 years, and has been under control for 18 months now, requiring no medication / pain killers, until I received the Pfizer vaccine...    4/6/2021 7:00pm  Received 1st Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine 4/7/2021 I awoke in excruciating pain.  Every nerve in my body felt like I had been Electrocuted leaving a painful tingly sensation, while at the same time on Fire.  The pain was so bad, I could not keep down food.  After 7 days of no food and constant pain level of 7 - 9 (10 point scale) my body started rejected everything; No food or liquids at all!  After 3 more days (10 days total) I was taken to the E/R.   After several tests, they immediately put me on IV drip of Saline, IV drip of Potassium, blood thinners, and pain killers.   The vaccine triggered a &#34;High Clotting Factor&#34; in my blood and the Dr.s were worried about blood clots / stroke.  Morphine was administered to reduce my pain.   After 2 days in the hospital, 5 bags of Saline, 2 bags of Potassium, Potassium supplements, Blood Thinners, a picture of Ice, a picture of Water, a picture of Tea, and morphine shots every 4 hours, I could finally urinate, but my Kidneys hurt like hell.  They still do.  SUMMARY:  * It&#39;s been 19 days and I still can&#39;t keep down food * I&#39;m still in excruciating pain ! ! !   (have appointment with Pain Management Dr. next week) * At least I&#39;m able to keep down liquids now  * Have lost 14lbs since the vaccine * I have been bedridden ever since receiving the vaccine, the pain is that bad * Kidneys still hurt like hell * Will this pain ever end ? ? ?

Patient stated, &#34;the second was really bad my arm was sore for like over a week I mean it was sore. I don&#39;t know I have not felt the same since. I can feel like the drug was inside me like something was changing and I never had no problem for anything but now its been like at the last when I got the shot was 9th of April of this month, its been like 2 weeks now almost and it is like I feel crappy. I have headache I have like a chest pain u know in my chest. I have like my heart is I don&#39;t know its like I am having a heart attack or something I don&#39;t know it is stroke or something. I do not know it is feeling funny. I have no problem I do, may be I have may be heart burn something. I don&#39;t know because on every single day everyday I have chest pain my heart, headache I have slight headache now. I don&#39;t know why I can feel a pain where my heart is on left side now I got the pain on right side you know I have the pain there and I wondering what&#39;s going on so I don&#39;t know&#34;. Consumer stated, &#34;First its both side that is what I am saying now right now so as I am talking to I have pain in my heart and like it feels the heart u know I don&#39;t know there is a weird thing in my heart.

This every single day you know that you I thought it will go away but it did not go away&#34;. Consumer stated, &#34;Yes, it is the first time. Like I said I thought it will go away but it is not getting any better. I am getting concerned. I do not know I have to be admitted to hospital. I do not have no insurance or anything. I am really worried.&#34; The patient hasn&#39;t been to the doctor, he was calling first for help. He has no insurance so he cannot just go to the doctor. Consumer stated, &#34;It never improved no.

A 58-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection; Lot number and expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the upper left arm on 18Feb2021 at 16:00 (at the age of 58-year-old) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma growing up as a child. It was an underlying medical condition and high blood pressure. No investigation assessment was not provided. Concomitant medication included Metoprolol for high blood pressure and one other but doesn&#39;t know the name of the other one. Patient also took a water pill. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Consumer reported that patient received first dose of COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021. He had symptoms ever since. The reporter wanted to know did he get COVID from the shot or should he have been tested before he got the shot and how long would the side effects could last. The reporter clarified patient symptoms as lost sense of smell, stuffy nose, hot and cold sweats, diarrhea one day, night sweats and headache on an unknown date in Feb2021. She mentioned that she finds it strangely coincidental that they received the shot and then &#34;all of the sudden they can&#39;t smell&#34;. The vaccination card given to him was in the car. The reporter doesn&#39;t have it on hand to provide lot number. It was given on the same date and at the same time as consumer, so probably the same lot number she received. Consumer&#39;s lot number was EN6200. No adverse events resulted in physician&#39;s office visit nor emergency Room. The events were assessed as non-serious. The clinical outcome of events was reported as unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

It was, honestly, the worst amount of pain I have ever experienced with a vaccine.  I got the vaccination around 10:15am and it was around midnight that the full effect hit me.  The pain was unbearable for 4-6 hours.  Then I was strong enough to get up to go to the bathroom for a Tylenol; it barely made a difference.   The nausea is so bad that, as I write, I still can&#39;t get myself to overcome the feeling to get something to eat.  I&#39;m feeling a bit hungry but the nausea is stronger.

                                                He got his vaccine, he felt achy, kind of weak at about 4:00 PM on the day of the vaccine.  Later on he took his temperature and it was 99 range.  It then went up to 101.4 that evening, but he felt very hot.  He felt very hot, face was red.  Somebody brought him over a thermometer and checked it again and it was 101.7, felt terrible and he took Tylenol.  The next day he felt achy like he had the flu, a headache, body aches and weakness, nauseous as well.  Then the next morning it was 102.3.  It fluctuated throughout the day.  Then later it went to 102.7 at 9:00 PM.  Then about 2 hours later before he went to bed it came down to 101.  Then he woke up on Sunday morning 3/28/21 his temperature was normal, he was exhausted from the fever.   He felt run down for a few days after that, knocked out and the nausea came back on 4/3/21.  No reaction at the injection site, just standard arm soreness, rash below the area of injection that lasted for about a week and went away.   He is still more tired than usual this week, but doesn&#39;t know if that&#39;s related to the vaccine or not.    The right arm 8 days later he got a rash at the injection site and a little bump that felt swollen.  That also ended up going away after a day or so.

My ears were ringing loudly and I had shortness of breath, I had difficulty breathing, and my chest was tight and I had pain in the center of my chest and I was nauseous and hungry but really couldn&#39;t eat anything. I checked my BP at home and it was 189/127 and then 192/122. I was well hydrated but I drank 2 16 ounce glasses of water and sat down to try and relax. An hour later the ringing stopped and I was feeling much better. I took my BP again and it was up to 202/126. I decided to go to the ER at this time. around 11pm it was 143/89.    Ringing and flushed still present with some stomach issues (4/9)

Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

It felt like something was laying on me pushing me down.  Another day my upper  right lip and upper right face swelled. Arm hurt at vaccine site.  All this went on over a period of 2 weeks.  To this day my upper right lip randomly swells.

A 59-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 for Covid-19 immunization on an unspecified date. He reported that on 27Mar2021 he got the 2nd COVID Pfizer shot and has increased on fatigue now and cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, also reported some abdominal swelling, none in legs. He reported weight gain but can la flat and no issues on resting conditions. He also reported dry cough since COVID shot but did not have any of such issues after the 1st dose. No fever, no dizziness or passing out. Diagnosis: Dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0) -Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 25-30. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis. His weight had increased from 217 lbs to 227 lbs - reported shob but no edema, they discussed increasing furosemide (LASIX) to 40/d from 20 daily for a week and reassess. Also suspect COVID vaccine related immune phenomenon. Treatment received for the events (Dilated cardiomyopathy, Left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac amyloidosis and weight gain). Events (has increased on fatigue, cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, abdominal swelling, weight gain and dry cough since COVID shot) onset date was on unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported cardiac amyloidosis, Dilated cardiomyopathy, and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations. More information on the patient&#39;s medical history, underlying medical conditions would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

                                                Starting on the day of the vaccine (2nd dose)- I felt &#34;a warm, chemical and electrical sensation&#34; in my chest a few hours after the vaccine. The next morning, I was unable to have a bowel movement, when usually I am very regular.  I was not able to have a bowel movement for a couple of days.  I felt very constipated and would try to force myself to have a bowel movement.  I ate more fiber and fiber pills and drink more water, which was uneffective.  I  was finally able to have a bowel movement but it took a lot of force and would push the point of exhaustion and almost passing out. On 2/19/2021, I decided to seek medical care for my constipation, stomach cramps, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and shortness of breath. The doctor diagnosed me with Covid long hauler (I had a previous covid infection in 11/2020).  I was prescribe probotics (for constipation) and  rest for 2 months.  I am still feeling fatigue and having heart palpitations. They order ECG(normal) and blood work (normal).

Followed up today 06/10/2021 with primary care physician. Have July 21,2021 follow up appointment with neurologist  *The reason I am reporting is because of my primary care physicians response to a comment I made to him about my sister thinking it could be the covid vaccine, while I thought perhaps it might be mini strokes, and he said it wasn&#39;t known that it might not be the vaccine. They told me in the hospital that the mri didn&#39;t show any more stroke damage than what had occurred  from the initial stroke I had earlier.

He says he didn&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem, says he had that problem like after 3, 4, or 5 weeks and all of a sudden he has a little episode where he gets to feeling funny, says his judgement is off and the brain things get a little not right. He stated he then fell a lot, says he&#39;s been falling a bunch of times in the last week, he&#39;ll feel better and it won&#39;t bother him. He says it&#39;s a cycle he&#39;s gone through since he lost oxygen. He doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s anything, it&#39;s confusing, says it has so many symptoms, and when he read this it has so many symptoms.  Confirmed patient was referring to COVID vaccine. He states he hasn&#39;t had eczema then most of it, sometimes he&#39;ll scratch, it will build up like a scab and he&#39;ll scrape it off, put some of the ointment on there. but a band aid on top, leave it down for a couple of days, after a shower, a couple of showers, it comes off. He says it clears it up, says if it doesn&#39;t, just wash, wash it hard, it scrubs the scab off.  He states the worst thing he had was his toenails, he had to work on them, had fungus things push under the nail, under the side, and he cut it. He used cortisone 10 on it, says they always quit making something that works well, states you know how you get a yellow toenail. He says he&#39;s been putting Neosporin on it. Clarified corcetin is Cortizone 10, it is pretty strong stuff. He says he puts it on these places on his arm using Neosporin. Attempted to clarify that itching began after use of Cortizone 10, states nothing like that, says it did itch a few days after still a little bit, there were three little places under that Band-Aid where they put the shot. He ended up putting Neosporin right when he took that band aid off it was itching, says he washed it good, then put Neosporin on it, says it&#39;s cleared back up to its normal roughness.  For event itching, he states at first it was almost a scab, but it was not quite a scab, it was wet like a little bubble. After the scab, when he got ready to take, it was itchy after the band aid was on there a couple of days, he took a shower, washed it, and put more ointment on it. Each time he took the Band-Aid off, he washed it, washed his arm, and put the Band-Aid back on. He did the same again and it&#39;s gone away.  He states he is feeling a little bit bad, his stomach is a little bit bad. He hadn&#39;t checked it lately, when he gets a fever, says 98.6 is about a half point to a point high. He was really, really tired, says he slept and slept and slept. Says this is similar to the cycle that he goes through with his brain injury, says it&#39;s the same cycle he goes through. He also stated he lost so much weight laying in bed.

Patient reports that, the diarrhea was starting to clear up a little bit, but still going to the bathroom and still had pretty severe stomach pains, in his lower stomach. The stomach pains were ongoing, they were not as often. They were still as strong, they were less, verified then as persisting. Patient reports that, he had gone to the bathroom like 17 times since like Friday, 11Jun2021. That was totally unusual, he was a day guy. Patient states that, it was clearing up and he was starting to return to regular stools. The patient went to work and was unsure how he got through the day. He tried to hide holding his belly, he has been in bed all weekend. The patient reports that, he got a physical a month ago and his annual physical was ok and a bunch of blood tests and they were fine. The patient states after physical he was signed up a bunch of tests to see if he had a risk for aneurysms. The patient reported that &#34;sonograms and stuff&#34; and that he did have a test down around my belly and such he had received 6 or 7 tests ultrasounds on different parts of the body looking for certain blockages and stuff but he had not received the results yet. He also shared that he didn&#39;t get the flu shot and declined the shingles shot at his last physcial, about a month and half ago.
