                                                Patient with PMH of depression and GERD who presented 1/8 with constipation, abdominal discomfort and worsening dyspnea. Symptoms began around 12/29. COVID vaccine 12/19. Previously quite active, marathon runner, gained some weight over last couple years but was still in good enough shape to complete 10K in New Orleans in early February. In late February, had a flu-like illness, as did one of his friends from church. 2020 was hard on him - weight gain, decreased activity, stress, overall deconditioning. No issues apart from sore arm after COVID vaccine 12/19 but then starting getting abdominal fullness/discomfort around 12/29, which steadily worsened, also develop worsening dyspnea on slight exertion. No known sick contacts.. Work-up notable for pericardial effusion, pleural effusions. Echo with severe diffuse LV hypokinesis, concern raised for myocarditis. COVID PCR negative, serology negative. RVP negative. . Concern raised that COVID vaccine may have played a role in myocarditis. He was found to have the following conditions Acute heart failure with reduced EF NYHA FC II,  non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Myocarditis appears subacute per MRI hypertension obesity small pericardial effusion- asysmptomatic no pericarditis suspected obstructive sleep apnea.   .Started on the following medications. Continue Carvedilol 12.5mg BID, Farxiga 5mg daily, Digoxin 0.125mg daily, Entresto 97-103mg BID, and Spironolactone 25mg daily.   Per MD note.  While it remains uncertain, team is doubtful COVID vaccine played a role in his cardiac issues. Given the MRI findings are not acute, more likely that the cardiac insult occurred weeks to months ago - potentially in the setting of the February 2020 illness. Perhaps his &#34;deconditioning&#34; in 2020 was related to worsening cardiac function. Nevertheless, will hold on 2nd COVID vaccine dose given absence of a clear explanation for his myocarditis. conversation with team will continue to determine if candidate for second covid vaccine. If consensus is that myocarditis pre-dated vaccine, might be able to proceed with dose 2 of vaccine.

A 40-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (BNT162B2, Solution for injection, Lot number: EN6206, Expiration date was not provided) via unspecified route of administration at left arm on 18Mar2021 09:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included type 1 diabetes and Sulfa drugs. Concomitant medications included insulin human (HUMULIN R), insulin human injection, isophane (HUMULIN N) and sildenafil. Historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6202) via unspecified route of administration on right arm on 25Feb2021 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunisation. If other vaccine in four weeks and Covid prior vaccination reported as no. Patient tested Covid post vaccination. On 20Mar2021 09:00, 2 days post vaccine small hard lump under chin developed. 4 days post vaccine lump/lymph nodes severely enlarged the size of a racquet ball and area around chin and neck severely swollen. The subject developed chills, fever, fatigue, body aches, shortness of breath, vomiting, painful to swallow. Due to pain from swelling Percocet , Fentanyl, Ketorolac, and Morphine were administered. It is also reported that the subject received antibiotics for the adverse events. 2 COVID test were negative. Due to difficulty breathing issues the subject was admitted through ER to hospital critical care unit for 9 days post vaccine. The subject was still in hospital 11 days post vaccine. The patient underwent lab test procedure included Nasal Swab (SARS-CoV-2 test): Negative on 26Mar2021 and Negative on 27Mar2021. The outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Assuming a plausible drug-events temporal association, the company cannot completely exclude a causal association between the reported, serious dyspnea and BNT162B2  administration. The impacts of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Discussed with another healthcare provider Discussed case with another healthcare provider ? Consultation Consultation 1, Consultation 2 ? Consultation 1 04/16/2021 15:54 ? Consultation 1 Comments discussed with  RPh.  He will come to ER to obtain additional information from patient.  This is the hospital&#39;s first presumptive Pfizer vaccine reaction. ? Consultation 2 04/16/2021 15:41 ? Consultation 2 Comments discussed with Dr.  we discuss presentation.  he agrees pt will need monitoring with the persisting symptom/findings and the H/O COPD.  1617 Dr has been to ER and completed eval.  pt to be placed on 2nd floor med/tele for additional monitoring and treatment.  pt did have labs yesterday.    ? Decision to Admit Based On  1446 Based on his symptoms and presentation presumptive acute anaphylaxis to component of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  We will begin treatment with 0.3 mg epinephrine IM once as well as dexamethasone, famotidine, diphenhydramine IV. We will continue to monitor with cardiac telemetry and pulse oximetry.  He does have slight wheezing but this may be related to his chronic COPD.  No respiratory distress at this time, but his symptoms seem to have been mildly progressive over the past hour (per his report).  I believe inclusion of the epi to be prudent based on his presentation. Additionally, I will inform the vaccination clinic of this reaction.  he agrees pt will benefit from continued monitoring and repeated IV antihistamine and IV steroid treatment.  Pt will need IVFluid for hydration as well.   Recheck: ? Recheck Recheck 1, Recheck 2, Recheck 3 ? Time 14:55 ? Recheck patient stable  patient improving with treatment ? Comments He is improving.  His skin is now warm and moist (not sweatty , not diaphoretic).  The rash is receeding from the arms. Good coloration to the legs/ankles.  Back &amp; torso rash starting to recede.  no nausea/vomiting. no difficulty breathing. still with fading macular rash on the torso and upper back.

Patient rash has faded from his extremities fully and appears to have faded from his abdomen still somewhat at the malar area of the cheeks as well as the neck and torso portion of the chest.  His pulse is 98?99 continues to have elevated blood pressure.  Pulse oximetry 98-100% on room air, normal.  Pharmacist will enter the reaction into the CDC/FDA/Pfizer database. Overall pt notes he feels tired (probably related to hydration &amp; benadryl).  He notes he has returned to home about 2 weeks ago after spending some time on the road in mountains playing guitar / touring with a small band , playing music. ? Time #3 15:37 ? Recheck #3 patient stable ? Comments #3 He has been resting.  No respiratory distress.  His blood pressure and pulse and pulse oximetry are reviewed at bedside and they are nonfocal at this time.  Overall he is improving.  He notes he still has malaise and feels about the same with itching in his back and the sensation in his throat.  When I evaluate his back there is hyperemia/some macular rash that is in approximately the distribution of the trapezius muscle of the back this is where he notes he has the itching.  Additionally when I evaluate his throat there is still some presence of uvula edema.  There is no other angioedema.  Perhaps he does have some mild hyperemia to the uvula and soft palate at this time.  He is clinically improving but his symptoms have not resolved fully.  Skin warm and dry normal turgor.

                                                On 12/26 (Sat), heart rate increased to 170 and then calmed down. On Sun and Mon - vomiting, nausea and HA on and off. On Mon heart rate increased again. Went to Urgent Care and tested covid negative. On Wed 12/30, BP at 180/105. Went to ED and BP eventually went down to 145/95. Dr is speculating that since patient had high antibodies from covid infection in August and still high antibodies in October that all of this is a wild immune reaction triggered by the vaccine.

                                                For the first 24 hours I had no symptoms other than arm pain. For the next 6 days experienced debilitating headaches, which led to nausea (because they were so severe). Elevated blood pressure also coupled with headaches.  I initially took Ibuprofen (which helped somewhat), whereas Tylenol did nothing. I also have a flexible ice pack that I placed over my head. That also helped a little. I went to the doctor on March 17th, but he was dismissive of the headaches being related to the vaccine. I have since been referred to  a neurologist (April 1st appointment).

A 41-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included drug hypersensitivity from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Allergic to sulfa, PCN and amoxicillin. The patients concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date the patient experienced sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, was pulled over for minor traffic violation. He was told to get out of the car and had a field sobriety test, and I looked intoxicated, felt heavy and tired/run down, had a headache, bad diarrhea, upset stomach, sleep for a few minutes, I didnt pass out but it was similar, crashed for 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day which I never do, aching, overall weakness, started feeling sick again at dinner, he went to the bathroom a few times, woke up feeling really bad. The patient was worried because everything was coming to a head right now. The caller got the first shot, he waited for 15 minutes and felt fine. As the caller walked to his car he began feeling heavy, had severe diarrhea, headache, aching, it was almost like he passed out, it felt like he went to sleep. The patient got home and crashed 4 to 5 hours in the middle of the day and woke up feeling really bad. The patient went to a very important dinner meeting that night. While the patient was at the meeting he went to the bathroom a few times and then excused himself because he felt so bad. The patient did not even finish one cocktail with dinner. The caller got pulled over for a minor traffic stop, cutting the corner and crossing the line or something small. The officers believed the caller was driving under the influence and started making him do a sobriety test with 40 degree wind gusts, the patient was miserable. The caller told the officers that he needed to seek medical attention but they ignored him. The officers forced the caller to do the urine test. It has been 5 days since his vaccination and he is just now feeling better. The outcome of events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed.  No further information is expected.

Fever peaked at 101.1F , nausea, constant headache, shaking chills and then sweats, extreme fatigue and full body severe muscle soreness. Light headed and very weak.  I slept all day until almost 1500. When I woke up my fever was gone. I&#39;m left tonight feeling hungry again along with some residual sore muscles and aches.  The fever responded well to Ibuprofen. I hydrated with water and Gatorade.  It pretty much felt like influenza for just under 48 hours. I feel like I&#39;m past the worst of it now, but I&#39;m not fully recovered.

                                                On April 18 and 19, following my 2nd injection, I had very bad chills and could not get warm. I was nauseous although I did not vomit. On April 22, I began having severe sharp stabbing pains just to the right of my belly button. It felt like I was being stabbed with a very hot knife, and after about 15-90 seconds, it would go away. Anytime I reached for something, bent over, twisted, turned or tried to hug someone, I would get this same pain and it would double me over in pain.  On Monday April 26 at 7pm, I finally checked into the Emergency Room  at the direction of my Primary Doctor.  They did a bunch of blood work on me and sent me for a CT Scan of my abdomen.  All of the blood work came back in normal ranges, and the CT Scan showed my appendix was &#34;borderline&#34; according to the surgeon. They consulted with Dr and decided to admit me for a surgical consult and further examination.  They gave me fluids and morphine through an IV for the first 24 - 36 hrs, and then switched to Norco by mouth. I continued having pain throughout my stay.  On Thursday, April 29, they took me to surgery for &#34;exploratory surgery&#34; with the intention of removing my appendix and looking around to see if anything else stood out to them that would cause me this pain.  They stated my appendix had scar tissue on it and they removed it, but said they did not know if this would stop the pain I was having.  On Friday April 30, I was released from the hospital at approximately 6pm.  By 9pm on Friday, I began having those same sharp, stabbing, burning pains in my abdomen again, now to the right of my belly button again and further towards my right side.  I also had sharp burning pain in the inside of my upper right arm, between my bicep and tricep muscles.  This pain continued on through the weekend occurring more frequently and more severe.  On Monday morning at about 1:30am, I woke up with severe abdominal pains all over and went into the bathroom.  I had diarrhea and nausea and felt like I was going to vomit.  Between 1:30am and 7:30am, I went to the bathroom 6 times.  I went to work on Monday and continued having abdominal pains and diarrhea all day and night.  On Tuesday, I went to the bathroom a total of 17 times. On Wednesday, I saw my primary Dr.,  who examined my abdomen and pains.  He suggested I take immodium for the diarrhea and a supplement for muscle pain, as he felt this was the cause of my pain. On Wednesday, I went to the bathroom 21 times and was very nauseaus.  I started the Imodium and it had no effect on me whatsoever.  On Thursday, I had to call off work because I couldn&#39;t stop using the bathroom.  By 4pm, I had been to the bathroom 18 times.  I returned to the ER.  They took a stool sample and did an ultrasound in the ER.  They decided to admit me again for surgical consult and pain management.  On Friday, Dr ordered another ultrasound of my abdomen, specifically my gallbladder, kidney, and liver.  He also sent me for a CT Scan with contrast.  They completed a total lab workup of my blood.  All of these results came back normal, and nothing on the images showed anything wrong with my organs.   On Saturday May 8, Dr came to the hospital to examine me. He stated everything related to my GI was fine.  He asked if I have back pain, which I told him I do.  At this time, I was in extreme pain and I couldn&#39;t even touch my skin. Dr attempted to examine my abdomen, and just by placing his hand on my stomach, I screamed in pain.  He then put his hand behind my back and pushed a little, and it cause extreme pain in my abdomen.  At this time, Dr suggested that maybe the pain is caused by something going on in my back.  Maybe a pinched nerve or something.  He ordered an X-ray of my upper and lower spine.  Later that day, the results of the X-ray came back and showed there was nothing wrong with my spine.  With these results, Dr then ordered an MRI of my lumbar and thoracic spine.  On Sunday May 9 at 1030am, I was taken to radiology for an MRI.  The initial report shows that I do not have any pinched nerves and nothing notable that would cause this type of pain in my body.   As of now, no diagnosis or explanation for the pain I am experiencing. The pain is gradually getting worse and at times I am unable to move at all without extreme severe pain in my body.  At times, my right groin hurts and I am unable to stand on my feet, as it feels as if I have pulled a groin muscle.  The pain in my abdomen takes my breath away and feels like I am being set on fire in that area of my body.  The pain no longer goes away and is constant, but moves throughout my right side from my groin to my shoulder only.  I am not able to put my right arm behind my back because I get this pain in the back of my shoulder area.  This pain is only on my right side at this time.  So far, there is no explanation for this pain.  I never had anything like this until I got the vaccine.

Denies any fevers recorded at home. He feels like he has extra beats intermittently. Also reports some nausea, but denies vomiting or diarrhea. He has maintained good PO intake since symptoms started, but is worried he may be a bit dehydrated because he had a small AKI when he had covid back in March?.  Etiology of chest pains unclear, but given all of the above workup, unlikely to be due to an acute cardiac or pulmonary etiology.&#34;  He continued to have palpitations for the next week and had further EKG&#39;s don thru urgent care.

                                                About 3 minutes after receiving the shot, I became dizzy.  After 15 minutes, I was still dizzy.  I had a little shortness of breath and it felt like my heart was beating faster but this only lasted a few minutes.  They had me wait an additional 10 minutes and the dizziness was better but not gone completely.  I drove myself home and tried to work from home but was feeling confused.  I took the rest of the day off.  The next day (yesterday) I woke up exhausted.  I took a sick day and slept until noon, which was about 14 hours in total.  When I woke up, I felt okay but had no appetite and did not get out of bed for 5 hours.  When I finally got up, I still felt dizzy.  I ate dinner, watched some TV and went to bed.  I woke up this morning without the fatigue but started to feel dizzy in the shower to the point where I almost lost by balance twice.  I&#39;m trying to work from home today but feel very dizzy and confused.  I couldn&#39;t remember my office&#39;s phone number.  I&#39;m sweating but my temperature is 97.5.

Medical history included retinal blood clot in his retina which was why he was tested for RA, and Meniere&#39;s disease for which he was asked to try meclizine which was for inner ear but he did not start taking meclizine, and six years ago, they did blood work and he was told he may have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or he may have markers for RA but he has had no further issues and does not take any medication for this. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced dizziness on 06Jan2021. The dizziness was increasing and he felt it most of the time. On 07Jan2021, he started feeling swimmy headed and he left work on 11Jan2021 since he was told he looked horrible. He never leaves work. He went to the clinic on the 11th since he felt like he was dizzy and going to throw up. The next day he did not feel better. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                On January 18, two days after getting the first dose of the vaccine I woke up with a sense of fullness or pressure in my left ear, mild sinus congestion, and chills. The congestion and chills ended after one day, but the feeling of fullness in the ear has persisted to this day. Then, on January 29, I had a bout of positional vertigo and vomiting that lasted two to three hours. I also experienced ringing or roaring in my left ear. Ever since, I have a bout of vertigo approximately every 24 hours, and the ringing and sense of fullness in the ear ebb and flow on 24 hours cycles as well. This experience has been debilitating and affected my ability to work. My doctor has diagnosed Meniere&#39;s disease and says he has been seeing similar symptoms apparently linked to the COVID vaccines. I started taking prednisone on doctor&#39;s orders yesterday (February 5), which has stopped the vertigo. Ringing and occasional fullness in the ears persist.

                                                On Monday I had the COVID vaccination. I noticed no side effects on Tuesday other than tenderness at the injection site. On Wednesday, I noticed light bruising up and down my arms. Thursday morning around 10 AM, I started to have side effect - some so severe they must be documented. At 10 AM, I felt lightheaded and had brain fog. By noon my head was pounding with a headache followed by an upset stomach. At 2 PM things started getting bad and continued to worse. It was not the headache or stomach that need to be noted but a sudden and severe onset of depression and anxiety. - Depression like I have not felt in years when I was at my worst. Throughout the day the depression worsened and by 7 PM, I was unable to stop crying and was overwhelmed with anxiety and  PTSD panic attacks. While I have the training to understand  this is temporary, - I am very worried about what I?m feeling , because there was no warning or mention of this side effect. I have the resources needed for this but people that are more fragile need to prepare for the sudden o set of critical/ debilitating depression.

My ability to breathe was unaffected, but it was incredibly difficult to swallow, like I could not generate any saliva naturally. Approximately 20 minutes after that, my tongue went numb. The symptoms went away several hours later after taking a couple of doses of Benadryl and Loratadine.

They initiated rapid response, when they came they simply monitored symptoms and Vitals. Blood pressure and Heart rate were elevated.  after about 10 min the symptoms eased, but swallowing was still difficult and slightly painful. then a second wave of dizziness hit me and I nearly passed out. my heart rate was elevated once again and had ringing in ears. these symptoms lasted another 5-10 min then eased. I then had a headache. The symptoms didn&#39;t return, just a headache and fatigue the rest of the day.  i was then given option to go to ED, which i didn&#39;t feel at that time I needed, so I left.  The next day, i had some standard symptoms of pain in left arm from injection, and fatigue, but then toward the evening i developed a fever of 101 deg F than continued for a couple of hours. I used ibuprofen and Tylenol rotating to keep the fever down. On day 3 only mild fatigue.

The pain gradually increased, became more intense, and more constant.  Mild fever and chills started happening, and I took Ibuprofen.  By about 4 days after the vaccine, the abdominal pain was severe enough that I had some difficulty walking and I couldn?t sleep at night.  Pain was 6-8/10.  I went to the ER, and CT scan with IV contrast showed 18 mm appendicitis.  I underwent laparoscopic surgery and it was found to be perforated.  It was removed.  I am currently recovering in the hospital.  I received the vaccine as a health care provider at my hospital, specifically I am a practicing pediatrician physician for over 10 years.

                                                A few hours after the shot my hands and feet where tingling and felt clammy/ swollen.  After work i noticed that my heart rate would increase when walking around and that the heart beat felt heavy.  If i was lying down the heart rate would be slightly elevated compared to normal resting heart rate.  The heart rate beat felt heavy.  I went to bed early and slept through the night.  I woke up the next morning and felt fatigued, dizzy, slight body ache and nauseated.  no fever, no headache.  i tried to take a shower but symptoms got worse.  i was unable to go to work that day.  I took a few naps during the day and by late afternoon most symptoms where going away.  the last symptom was the issue with the hands and feet.  Heart rate returned to normal.   The next day i was able to return to work.

                                                After the required wait period of 15 minutes I started to drive back home which is 77 miles from the hospital that administered the vaccination.  Around 15 minutes down the road I started feeling like something was caught in my throat and was coughing a little.  At that time I decided to turn around and go back to the hospital.  I took an oral Benadryl 25mg and decided to wait in my car and see if it was something else.  After 30-45 minutes I took a drink of water and realized I was having trouble swallowing.  I then preceded into the ER and was admitted immediately.    In the ER, they started an IV, administered Benadryl, methylprednisolone and a bag of saline.  The physician discussed with me and we agreed to hold the Epinephrine to see how I reacted to the previous medications.  I was then monitored for a couple hours then released with a prescription of Prednisone 60mg for 5 days and an EpiPen.    One day out, no new symptoms besides injection site pain.

A 43-year-old male patient received first single dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer, Solution for injection, lot number and exp date not reported), intramuscular (vaccine location: left arm) on 28Dec2020 for COVID-19 immunization. Facility type vaccine: Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. Medical history included gastric sleeve and surgery. The patient had no known allergies. Patient did not have Covid prior vaccination. There was no other medical history. There were no concomitant medications. There were no other vaccine/s within four weeks. No other medications in two weeks. The day after patient received the vaccine, she got the common side effects on Jan2021: chills, loose stool, and nausea. She also began having heartburn/indigestion (Jan2021). It had been 16 days since the first dose, and the loose stool and heartburn/indigestion remain. Not sure if it&#39;s because of having the gastric sleeve done years ago, or not, as the surgery changed her metabolism and the like. No treatment was provided. Nasal Swab on 11Jan2021 was negative. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Patient had vasovagal syncopal event. This event was not a vaccine side effect but a vasovagal response (previous history of syncope with vaccinations/procedures).   Patient received 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine around 11am today. Within 2 minutes of receiving the vaccine, he started to feel dizzy and passed out for around 45 secs. He had cold extremities, looked pale and was sweating. He was immediately transferred from chair to floor and his legs were raised. Cold towel was placed on his head. He regained consciousness but was confused for less than a 1min. Vitals were checked and his BP was 95/50&#39;s and HR was around 56. Pulse O2 was 99% during entire event. He was able to converse well after that and was oriented. He informed having anxiety/panic attacks, had taken his medication that morning. He reported similar syncopal episodes in the past. He was monitored in same posture. He was gently hydrated orally with water and soda. He was given sublingual zofran due to nausea and retching. He did not vomit. We continued to monitor his BP on regular intervals. He had slow improvement in BP and after 2 hrs while sitting his BP was 104/65, pulse 56/min (reports being an athlete and previous records show baseline bradycardia). He denied any symptoms and was awake, alert, oriented.    As he was not accompanied by anyone, his wife was contacted who came to clinic in 10mins and helped to drive him home. He was transported by wheelchair till entrance of clinic. He reported feeling better and thanked for helping.   He does not have any contraindications to receive 2nd dose of vaccine.

                                                After about 10 minutes I started feeling weird. I became light headed. Then I felt a burning sensation done both arms and my tounge. My heart was beating fast and I was struggling to get my breathing under control. My throat also got tight or warm and that feeling seem to go down through my chest. The monitor told me to take off my mask and gave me water. Shortly after I started to gag and almost vomited. The monitor checked my blood pressure and it was 180 over 120. I was admitted to the ER. I stayed there for about an 90 minutes as was released as the symptoms seemed to leave. While driving home many of the symptoms resurfaced. When I returned home I took a zyrtec and an anxiety medication. A day after I am light headed and a little nautilus but otherwise ok.

                                                About an hour after getting my first shot i started to have back and leg pain, a headache was developing.  about an two and a half hours I started feeling weak. It was hard for me to lift and carry things, I was getting winded walking across the building and the i would feel a little nauseous but that would go away after standing still for a few minutes.

                                                Severe spinning, nausea, vomiting, occurred at 2:15 a.m. while on duty, was transported to ER and diagnosed with Peripheral Vertigo. Follow ups with ENT, Neuro and PCP have continued with Vestibular Rehabilitation. While in ER, the MRI, MRA, CT, CT with Contrast was done, showed no signs of anything that could have caused this. Ironically tracking back, I received my 2nd Dose of the Pfyzer Vaccine on January 6, 2021 at 8:45 a.m. and this occurred on February 13th at 2:15 a.m. I have not had any other issues before this nor any signs of damage to the nerve or ear that regularly affects Vertigo Patients per my Neuro and ENT. The incident took place 4 weeks and 2 days after the 2nd vaccine. 2 days after the 2nd dose, I experienced Low grade fever, chills, and body aches that lasted only 12 hours, but nothing with the 1st vaccine nor anything after the 2nd dose issue until the Vertigo.  I am unable to drive, conduct my job, which requires me to go to emergency calls and carry a Taser (CEW). I have been off work since this occurred and still not eligible to go back to work.

                                                Little muscle twitches; felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines; Low grade fever; Muscle soreness; Muscle tiredness; Hands were a little shaky; Very diaphoretic; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other Nurse. This 44-year-old Nurse (Patient) reported that he received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: unknown) at single dose for vaccination in Jan2021 around 9:45am. Relevant medical history included ongoing Mild shrimp allergy  and ongoing Hypertension. Relevant concomitant drugs included amlodipine at 10 mg once daily for Hypertension since Feb2020 and ongoing. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): None.  Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was None. The patient was administered the COVID Vaccine around 9:45am; about 10 minutes later he had onset of little muscle twitches on the left side of his body that started in the calf then the glute, then the quadricep, then the bicep and then just started bouncing around everywhere on left side. Approximately a half an hour after that those little muscle twitches started on the right side of his body. Now the little muscle twitches are just everywhere; his hand, his heel, right now as he is speaking he is having the little muscle twitches in his heel; This event has been ongoing since onset; but changed today around 5:00am when he felt muscle twitches really deep in his abdomen, almost like in the intestines which is probably impossible, but it feels like it is not just muscular now, like it is happening in his intestines which concerns him. The little muscle twitches do not hurt, he thinks that is probably why he has waited a week to call; but the fact that they are ongoing and changed today, worsened is unsettling. He reported since that first dose of COVID Vaccine was administered he has also had low grade fever; muscle soreness; muscle tiredness. He reported that a rapid response team was called immediately because of the initial reaction he had. Later that day his hands were a little shaky, he got very diaphoretic and the nurses on the unit of the hospital said he almost fell which he does not recall at all; in response to those events he was taken to the emergency department where they did a complete workup including labs: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP), checked his heart and everything was fine; no notable results from any of those tests. The patient was not admitted to the hospital; under observation in emergency room only. Outcome of events Little muscle twitches, Low grade fever, Muscle soreness and Muscle soreness was not resolved, outcome of other events was unknown.    Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                He had his first vaccine March 19th, 2021 at 12:15, same lot as above, and 24 hours later he had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, fatigue, shakes, chills and feeling of weakness/dizziness. It lasted a few days. Then, April 9, 2021, he received his second Covid19 Pfizer shot, same lot at 12:15 pm and  the next morning, Saturday, April 10th around 9 am Ira felt the same symptoms from shot 1, but more intense. He was feeling weak, had chills, shakes, profuse sweating, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, dizziness and vomiting.  He was unable to keep water down and stayed in bed. A little after 12pm, he complained of difficulty breathing and possibly not getting enough oxygen so I grabbed my equipment (since I&#39;m a CNA) and checked his vitals. His B/P was very high ( 166/107), no fever (96.7), pulse was normal 72, and low respiration but oxygen was above 90. He said he needed to use the bathroom, I suggested using his urinal but he said he needed to have a bowel movement. Once he was in the bathroom, I went downstairs for a glass of water and then suddenly I heard a huge thump. I ran upstairs, knocked on the bathroom-no response but I could hear noises, so I opened the door and I saw he was face down on the floor, head under the bathroom sink counter, blood everywhere, and he was convulsing. I grabbed him immediately and moved him to his side (I had my fitbit on, it said it was 12:30pm), and he kept seizing. He looked discolored almost blueish color. I held him on his side, he vomited, making noises, but unable to speak, continuing to have a seizure. Seizure lasted three minutes. At 12:33pm, once he had calmed, I ran downstairs to find my phone. I was back at his side calling 911 at 12:35. Paramedics arrived 9 minutes later and took him to the hospital. My brother picked me up and took me to the hospital. Once outside his door, I noticed he was finishing taking X-Rays when he suddenly had another seizure.

Comprehensive labs done.  Follow-up advised with Dr.  (has not occurred).  Per Dr. (Neurology), do not get second dose of Covid-19 vaccine as there is a chance the vaccine contributed to development of these symptoms.  Doctor said it could possibly be Guillain-Barre Syndrome. As of 5/11/21, significant vision impairment still exists and patient is unable to work.  Patient is uninsured.

                                                Received vaccine on 12/21/2020.  Developed constipation that cleared on 12/26/2020 with use of colace.  Had episode of diarrhea on 12/28/2020.  Abdominal pain began at 2330 on 12/29/2020 and worsened through the night.  Went to ER at 0500 hours on 12/30/2020 where I was diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent appendectomy on the same day by Dr.  I have no idea if this is related to the vaccine or simply a coincidence.  In error of caution, I am reporting this.  Thank you.

                                                While on duty and in uniform as an emergency paramedic I received my second  scheduled covid19 vaccination.  Approximately five minutes after receiving  C19 dose 2 vaccination (1335hrs). I experienced a syncopal episode while walking back to my work area and was lowered to the ground by another EMS provider. I was then placed in a wheelchair by the  EMS provider and an RN and taken to the emergency department at Medical Center. (1337hrs)  I  regained alertness and felt severe nausea and general weakness and was assisted into in ER bed.  Staff doctor attended along with RN . An assessment was completed, 12 lead EKG completed, IV established, 8mg Zofran administered, 1000ml of Normal Saline was bolused. Labs were drawn.  ED staff continued to monitor me for the next  2 plus hours I was monitored for anaphylaxis and other symptoms. My symptoms of nausea mostly resolved and my strength returned.  A Resident MD completed a final evaluation and determined it was safe for me to be discharged. (1607hrs)

                                                The arm muscle that received the shot became quite sore overnight, and lasted throughout the next day.  The rest of me felt like I had a mild case of the flu.  Aches and fatigue all over, with some chills.   I have been training for a half marathon, and this through off my training due to knee pain.    I also had diarrhea that has lasted through Saturday.   The first day after was the worst, and things have improved each day since.

Became very tired and loss of appetite followed by diarrhea about 8 hours after shot followed by mild headache through the next 24 hours.  I am reporting this mainly because my reaction was unexpected and happened on the first dose.  I have not yet received my second dose.

A 45-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL6269), via an unspecified route of administration in Left arm on 04Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 45-years-old) at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history was reported as none.  There were no concomitant medications. 51 hours after receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting down watching a film. His left arm began to tingle, and he felt a wave of dizziness and nausea come over him. He stood up, walked a few steps and sat back down. He broke out in a cold sweat, chills, and saw stars. He leaned forward with his head in his hands, and apparently fainted for a moment and lost control of his bladder. All events started on 06Feb2021 06:00 PM. No treatment received for the events. The outcome of the events was recovered in Feb2021. No covid prior vaccination, no Covid tested post vaccination, no known allergies.

                                                Right ear pain started on the Wednesday afternoon, two days after Vaccine shot. By Friday evening the ear pain was intense and it had moved below the ear to lymphnode area. Saturday, his ear was really swollen and red. He went to the Urgent Care and they prescribed an antibiotic Cephalexin thinking it could be some sort of ear infection or insect bite. Sunday morning he woke up with his face droopy. We tried to get an appt. with Urgent Care, but they sent us to the ER. The ER did a physical assessment and concluded he had an ear infection and Bells Palsy. The prescribed another antibiotic Doxycycline, an antiviral Famciclovir and a steroid of prednisone. By Monday he was extremely nauseas and had started having vertigo. We went to Urgent Care and they prescribed him Ondansetron for nausea and made the assessment that he had Shingles in his ear. We saw PCP on Wednesday and he assessed that this was a zoster ear infection causing facial paralysis and vertigo, also known as a rare condition called Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and that it was most likely attributed to his Covid vaccine shot and not to get the second vaccine shot. The Dr. took him off the antibiotics and put him on a higher dose of prednisone, a different antiviral (valacyclovir) and Meclizine for vertigo symptoms. He sent referrals for Neurology, ENT and Eye Dr. He saw the Neurologist that Friday and he concurred Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, most likley from Covid Vaccine and do not get the second vaccine shot. The neurologist referred him to Physical Therapy to treat his vestibular issues. He ordered an MRI and some blood work. We are still waiting for the results. We saw an ENT an he had him have a hearing test which showed moderate high frequency hearing loss. The ENT prescribed Gabapentin for the ear and face pain. He started to see a physical therapist this week, he had his MRI on Wednesday and we see the ENT again on Monday. He has no improvement yet, other than the nausea has subsided.

At 6am, he was found blue/dead in his bed.

Caller states he has an appointment with a neurologist and he&#39;s trying to get it moved up. Caller states his doctor wants to do a lumbar puncture to rule out MS or Parkinson&#39;s that sort of thing. Caller states but at this point they are trying to rule things out. Caller states he doesn&#39;t have a family history of really either them. Caller states there was no diagnosis. Caller states the doctor said he was pretty sure its a stroke, mini stroke, but his general practitioner doesn&#39;t think its a mini stroke. Caller states the effects are so long going and they will improve and fall back and then the doctor also said at the fact that has been cognitively aware the whole time, so there&#39;s been no official diagnosis yet.

Increasing injection site pain throughout the day with mild chills and nausea starting around 7:00 pm (Approx 11 hrs after injection). Chills steadily intensified, with fever beginning, became severe over the next 2-3 hours, and persisted throughout the night. Along with the fever/chills &amp; nausea, there was also moderate muscle/joint pain (mainly neck and back), moderate to severe fatigue and weakness, weird freaky dreams, restlessness, and moderate headache. Symptoms started to relent around 6:00 am the morning after injection, however fatigue/weakness, nausea, and mild fever/chills have persisted throughout the day with minimal improvement.

I also became very tired even though I was well rested.  The nausea and dizziness lasted approx 2-3 hours.  At that time I developed moderate injection site pain.  I was very fatigued for the remainder of the night and through the next day (6 Jan).  I was no longer fatigued as of 7 Jan but starting that morning I had a very difficult time focusing mentally.  That condition lasted until late on the evening of 7 Jan.  As of 8 Jan, all symptoms have resolved and I feel fine.

Roughly 2/3 hours after taking  vaccine my entire upper back was stiff and it hurt to turn  my head left. I took muscle relaxers and rested throughout the day. About 10 hrs after vaccine my headache was gone but still had moderate muscle aches. When I woke up (20 hrs after) the muscle pains were  moderate so I came into work. 26 hrs later I I&#39;m still having mild body aches.

                                                Possible symptom 1: Within approximately a day or two of the shot, I developed a severe and persistent lower abdominal/groin pain.  The pain was very pin point in location and lasted for approximately 10 days before easing up.  Very small isolated pain severe enough to go to the DR, but I could not afford to on account of my wife having severe unknown abdominal pain and being in the ER and DR  multiple times herself (she got the same vaccine an hour before me?).  Possible symptom 2:  4-5 days after the shot I developed an isolated and severe pain in a preexisting nodule/mass (lymph node?) located on my mid right thigh, it has never had any sensation before.  The pain was persistently severe for approximately 7 days before easing up.

                                                On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the 12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a negative COVID-19 test for him.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 46-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 13Jan2021 12:15 PM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no known allergies. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient has not been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient reported that he felt fine after the shot for the rest of the day and the first night other than the soreness where he received the shot. The patient went to bed around 11 pm and woke up the next day (14Jan2021) at around 6:30 am with very bad dizziness. He felt like his eyes were rolling around in his head which made him very nauseous and sick to his stomach. His wife called a friend who is a nurse and she said to keep an eye on him for a little while and see how he was in an hour or so. She said that if it gets worse call 911 otherwise get him to the clinic at 10 am. He reported that he was feeling much better by then but went to clinic at 10 and doctor saw him asked questions gave me something for nausea and dizziness. He felt good the rest of the day with slight lightheaded. He mentioned that he needs get his second shot on 03Feb2021 and was concerned about getting it. He inquired on what is the recommendation on getting dose #2. It was not reported if the patient been tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The adverse event result in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. They gave me ondansetron (ZAFRAN ODT [orally disintegrating tablets]) 4 mg for nausea. The patient considered the events was non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date with sequelae (recovered with lasting effects).

                                                Starting about 5-6 hours after the shot I developed severe bloating, cramping and gassy-ness, literally constant burping.  My stomach has been in constant pain.  I?ve also had a slight fever and a very sore arm.  Tylenol and rest has worked for the fever and arm, and I&#39;ve had some addition body aches.  Not sure how much is due to being in bed for an extended period.  Also on Friday (about 24 hrs after getting the shot I was pretty fatigued.  I just woke up from 13 hours of sleeping.  But the stomach cramps/pains was severe and prompted me to try to find a way to report it, especially since it doesn&#39;t seem to be too common.  It&#39;s been really bad.

                                                At about 6 pm I started having stomach cramps and diarrhea. The cramps worsened and by midnight the pain was at a nine. I was vomiting with intense force but nothing was coming up. My abdomen was bloated to the point where I couldn&#39;t stand upright and breathing was very painful. I was in that condition for about 12 hours before the swelling began to lessen. Now, 2 days later, I am still unable to eat and drink as normal and have moderate gastrointestinal discomfort with bloating.

Itching and swelling subsided with a dose of Loratadine. Nausea worsened that night and vomiting ensued with diarrhea worsening. At bedtime, itching returned, sleeplessness, vomiting and sweating profusely from the scalp and face, slight difficulty filling lungs with air. Another dose of Loratadine calmed symptoms. Wednesday (10th) through the next Thursday (18th ), nausea persisted, but eased with Benadryl and Emerton. Diarrhea persisted through Monday (15th). No fever, no soreness, no headache.

I was perfectly healthy before the shot.. then several days after developed an ache in my right abdomen, fatigue and constant ringing in ears that will not go away.  I&#39;m also having a very hard time sleeping.. sometimes only being able to get 2 or 3 hours a night regardless of how tired I am.  I&#39;m very disappointed and not sure if I should get the second shot or not given how I&#39;m feeling now.  Before the shot I was perfectly healthy.  I eat well, exercise and have never in my life experienced tinnitus or any type of hearing problem.  This shot was the ONLY thing that could have caused this.  I&#39;m not sure what to do next or if I should get the second shot which could make it worse.  I&#39;m very worried because the ringing and aches have been constant for 10 days..  some days worse than others.

At work his cough and chest tightness worsened. Very tired, unable to eat with no appetite. Extreme fatigue Wednesday sleeping most of the day. Cough and chest tightness and feeling he cannot catch breath like being submerged in a pool. On 4.15.21 his feet became numb and tingling bilaterally. He felt more confusion, forgetting what he was doing, left frozen food in the sink and unable to recall why. He is also having headache posteriorly 7-8/10 which began on 4.14.21. He reports headache is not common, now 3-4/10 and feels very similar to Covid in November. Does have some mild neck stiffness associated. Chest tightness almost identical to Covid in November.

Wife reports that he seemed unsteady while walking Kept for observation.   difficulty concentrating - back to baseline 4/17/21 at 3:26 pm assessment SOB: CTA thorax 4/16/21 unremarkable CT angiogram thorax Symptoms began approximately 5 minutes after his Pfizer.  Reports that his cough and shortness of breath now seems to be improving.  Continues to have some mild chest tightness, intermittent cough.  Robitussin significantly helped.  Extensive workup including CT angiogram of the thorax reveals no evidence for pulmonary embolism or infiltrate.  COVID-19 PCR testing is negative x2, severe respiratory isolation has been discontinued.  Patient has a negative D-dimer, LDH, ferritin, CRP.   Cardiac troponin has been negative x2.  Patient does have some wheeze, after cough, suggesting some bronchospasm.  Will trial albuterol inhaler q.i.d..  Patient does report a history of what sounds like an environmental triggers asthma like event in the past, though reports that he has undergone evaluation for asthma and was told that he does not carry a diagnosis of asthma.  Patient is currently on room air.  I have reviewed the reported adverse reactions from the Pfizer vaccine and coughing shortness of breath are not listed.

                                                On March 25, 8 days after the vaccine shot in my left arm, I began experiencing intense pain on the left side of my neck and head. By March 28 the pain had become so excruciating I went to an Urgent Care facility and they sent me to the Emergency Room. While in the ER I had blood tests and a CT scan which all came back negative. I was given Oxycodone-Acetaminophen for the pain and prescribed Cephalexin in case there was some type of infection. They also ruled out Shingles. I continued to have pain and contacted my Primary Care Physicians Office and spoke with one of the Physician Assistants two times the next week. She prescribed Baclofen 10 mg and took me off the Cephalexin and put me on Amoxycillin because we thought the problem might have been an ear infection. The next week I spoke with my Primary Care Physician, and he believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia, so he put me on Carbamazepine 200 mg twice a day. That same week, on April 9, I was finally able to meet with the Physician Assistant at the Neurologists office and she also believed I was suffering from Trigeminal Neuralgia. I continued to take the Carbamazepine daily and the Baclofen and Oxycodone-Acetaminophen as needed. On Monday April 12 I informed the nurses at the Neurologist office that I was experiencing several symptoms/side effects that included dizziness, weakness, difficulty swallowing and a pounding heartbeat. The nurses talked with the PA and the PA took me off the Carbamazepine and put me on Oxcarbazepine 150 mg twice a day and she prescribed Methylprednisolone 4 mg. On Thursday April 15 I began to have intense prolonged pain behind my left ear down to the neck and in the Trigeminal nerves in the forehead and top of the head on the left side. I was in so much pain I slept for less than 2 hours. The next morning, I vomited and went to the Emergency Room again. At the ER they treated my pain with a headache IV cocktail that included Ibuprofen, Benadryl, an anti-nausea medication, Fentanyl, and a steroid. Within an hour my pain level dropped from a 9 to a 3 and I was released. The ER prescribed Gabapentin 300 mg (3 times a day) which I started the evening of April 16. I have had less constant pain since leaving the ER and starting the Gabapentin, but I continue to have pain in the Trigeminal nerve areas and neck with some flare ups that reach a 7 out of 10 in pain. I am scheduled for an MRI on April 23 and a visit with the Neurologist on May 10.

A 46-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number ER8727) via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 30Mar2021 at 08:00 (at the age of 46-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included sarcoidosis from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and had not received any other vaccines in the 4-weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medications included atorvastatin, pantoprazole, fluticasone propionate (FLONASE), and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) all from unknown dates for unknown indications. The patient previously received morphine on an unknown date for an unknown indication and experienced drug allergy, and the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number EN6208) on 09Mar2021 at 13:15 (at the age of 45-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. On 30Mar2021 at 08:45 the patient experienced low grade fever, arm so sore that you don&#39;t want to move it, body aches, fatigue, headache, metallic taste in their mouth, further reported as nothing tasted good yesterday (as of 31Mar2021), and nasal drip with nausea. No treatment was provided for the events. The outcomes of low-grade fever, arm so sore that you don&#39;t want to move it, body aches, fatigue, headache, metallic taste in their mouth, and nasal drip with nausea were not recovered. It was also reported the patient had not been tested for COVID since vaccination.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                1/13/21 0740 Received second dose of COVID-19 vaccine, which was scheduled for that morning. Did not experience anaphylaxis or other symptoms of vaccine injury. I took 1gram of Tylenol PO when I got back to my motel by 0830.  By 0924 I noted that my left deltoid (injection site) and arm were very sore/achy. I fell asleep until 1740. I noted that I was experiencing more body aches at this time (joint and muscle, especially in my bilateral shoulders, lower back, knees and pelvis). Calf muscles were quite sore. I made pasta with red sauce and made a pot of blueberry tea, ate and went back to bed. 2327 I woke again with weird fever dreams and my right bicep was intermittently twitching. I think I was starting to run a low grade fever at this time (my ears felt hot, and my stomach was queasy but was not nauseous), no diaphoresis, shortness of breath or airway constriction. I remained awake until 0200, 1/14/21. By 0400 I was experiencing mild chills, face was flushed, headache on the right, with pressure behind my right eye, parietal and occipital areas of my skull. The pain extended into the right muscles of my neck (trapezius, levator scapulae and sternocleidomastoid muscles). Bilateral upper arm muscles and joints were 5:10 pain. I was also experiencing mild photophobia, but not migraine related, and a mild non-productive cough and pressure behind my facial and ethmoid sinuses with scant viscous secretions at the back of my throat. 0433 I forced myself to get out of bed and head to the bathroom. My temp was 101. I took a very hot shower and am back in bed. Experiencing a lot of malaise and lethargy. 1/15/21 0830 temp is currently 99.1, headache is present, 3:10. Joint aches have mostly subsided. Injection site is warm and tender, but no erythema is present.

                                                About 4 am the night after the vaccination,  I developed significant left arm pain. Hurt; throbbed  and didn&#39;t want to use it. Went to work but about 7:00 am- I noticed my right arm began to work as well - almost in the the same severity. Spell- lose consciousness alost- had bad headache; - it abated and it happened again - almost lost consciousness. It  left. And it happened again a third time and went to a stretcher - nurse took my BP  220/110 - blood pressure - very high for me and laid on the stretcher and had nurses hook me up ot monitors; No change on cardiogram and my oxygen saturation level never altered and never dropped; My BL remained elevated - significantly. 180/90 before I went home. Continued to check my BP when I went home - queasy; nauseated - upset stomach and then fever the following day - remained for 4-5 days. Fever was one day and got 100.5 and then was gone after that day. BP continued to check regularly through next few days - it did improve a bit but was still elevated - 180/150 (systolic) and 110/95 (Diastolic) - Slowly got back to normal by day 7 after vaccination.   Went to work the 30th the day before New Year&#39;s Eve, finally and had dizziness never got quite as severe - 50% but left arm pain very very painful - almost numb; right arm hurt some, too. Blood 190/110 .Oxygen Saturation remained good. Arm pain very bad - ordered EKG - was normal Admitted my self to ER - Had a full work up - repeated EKG - negative; two sets of troponins - negative; chest x-ray - nothing - BMP  - elevation in my creatine which I&#39;ve never had before.  CBC -  normal; They treated me with fluid hydration; Tylenol; fentanyl and hours later I felt a bit better.  Things calmed down and I was released. BP remained elevated for next two days. I got better after two days _ enough to work - but still would get a little disequilibrium not enough to pass out but just like an odd feeling and then it would go away after a few seconds. And that is only recently disappeared - within the last week or so. I feel better now but my BP remains elevated - 160/140 (systolic)  over 105/95 (dystolic) - that&#39;s al new for me. I have declined the second vaccination. Have sort of recovered but it did come back after time and so it may come back again - don&#39;t know. I may have been exposed to COVID the week before my vaccination. About 4 days after the severe symptoms that lead to my leading to take off work;  I took test for COVID  - PCR at CVS (returned positive) and COVID test  PCR and  rapid antigen  (returned negative) at Public Health -

                                                I &#39;had Covid&#39; beginning Saturday before Thanksgiving.  During that period, I had two tests, both from facility, and both tests came back negative. Symptoms included fever 102-103 for 12 days. No appetite (didn&#39;t eat for that duration). Headache. Excessive sweating. Extreme shallow breath. Hyperventilation. Body ache. No loss of smell or taste. No nausea. No mucus response.  Since that time, I have experienced extreme fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, headache.  After the first shot, those three symptoms increased.  With the second shot, I had fever 99.5-101 from Tuesday though Saturday. Nausea, headache, body ache, weakness, shortness of breath. It felt 85% similar in symptom and intensity as when I &#39;had Covid&#39;.   The greatest difference is the nausea. When I &#39;had Covid&#39; there was no nausea and I did not throw up. This time, I had persistent nausea and threw up multiple times in the first three days.

Denies abdominal pain but feels nauseated and has been vomiting off and on all day. No other GI sx. Pt has known hiatal hernia but doesn&#39;t take anything for GERD right now because he doesn&#39;t have heart burn sx. Denies chest pain. Gets sweaty randomly and chilled, but this is more chronic. Sees neuro for early onset parkinson dx but no change in medicine in over a month. No new supplements. Denies dark stools. Pt taking all his medications with compliance. Has been getting more headaches lately too but thinks this is stress and from wretching. Has chronic headaches. Pt has OSA and has been wearing his Cpap with compliance. Gave patient zofran, prilosec, carafate for suspected gastritis sx. Recommended he come get labs in the morning as well. Pt agreed.  4/1 ER HPI: 47 y.o. male who presents with complaints of nausea vomiting abdominal pain ongoing now for the past day reports that is better with rest worse with movement denies any other complaints issues  4/1 Admission HPI: 47 y.o. male that was recently diagnosed with Parkinson&#39;s disease.  He presented to the emergency room with the a several day history of fluctuating blood pressure and nausea/vomiting and generally feeling very poorly.  He has been having a lot of new onset health issues lately and so his wife and family were concerned.  He was brought into the emergency room.  He denies any severe abdominal pain.  However, he states he has been feeling extremely nauseous.  He is vomited at least once a day for the last 5 days.  He does admit that he is under an extraordinary amount of stress between his new onset Parkinson&#39;s, his insurance business, and his full-time job as a pastor.  The patient also does have a history of alpha-gal allergy.  He states it is possible he ate some cross contaminated meat, but states that this nausea and vomiting does not act like his typical response to eating something that he is allergic to.   The patient states that about a month and a half his neurologist did increase his Requip up from 0.5 mg 3 times a day to 1.5 mg 3 times per day.  However, it has never made him nauseous before.  He denies any definite chest pain.  He denies any exertional dyspnea.  He does admit that his blood pressure has been fluctuating for quite some time.  He states he was having a skin biopsy done last week and they almost abandon the procedure because his blood pressure was so high.

                                                I received the first dose of Pfizer EK5730 at 18:07 on 12-30-2020.  For the first day my arm was a bit sore but nothing to bad.  The next few days 48-72 hours later I started to have many more  symptoms, some minor to sever including joint pain, headache, fatigue, and dizziness.  lesser included some nauseas.   The joint pain was so bad at one point i had to pull over while driving.  on 1-2-21.  as of writing this now 14 days out I still have some joint pain especially in my arms.  No other symptoms of note.   I would add that I tested positive for COVID -19 on 10-18-2020 and was not released from quarantine until 11-5-20  I did seek treatment during this time through by calling my Dr. did not require any hospitalization.

                                                The morning after the first dose (taken on 1/20/2021) I threw up and have felt dizzy/nauseous frequently. The throwing up only happened that morning but the dizziness continued. The dizziness happened when I turned my head to quickly or bent over.   After the second dose (taken at 2:30pm on 2/11/2021) I have dry heaved nearly every morning since. I&#39;m not throwing up anything but the dry heaving happens nearly every morning and continues to even today (3/2/2021). I don&#39;t feel nauseous even though I dry heave... which seems strange. I still feel like I have vertigo, which I did not have prior to taking the COVID19 vaccine.

Dr. physically examined my abdomen. He exerted light pressure, which led to extreme pain, and I vomited 6 additional times in the exam room. Dr. ordered a CT scan. He and Dr. diagnosed a partial small bowel obstruction. The patient (me) has never had any abdominal surgery, or and problems whatsoever with bowel obstruction.

A 50-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EJ1685; expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the upper right arm on 21Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure high, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), hypertension all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, and was a former smoker. Concomitant medication included lisinopril and methylphenidate. The patient reported that after he received the vaccine, he tested positive for Covid on 30Dec2020. The patient further reported that he ended up getting significant gastritis on Christmas Eve, which he didn&#39;t think about acquiring COVID, he had had the vaccine, he ate a bunch of holiday fare, so he thought he had got a stomach bug or something like that. He says he had considerable diarrhea on Christmas morning, but no fever or chills, then those symptoms resolved by Saturday, and he didn&#39;t think about it, he didn&#39;t have any issues. He says that he went to get tested, which they do frequently, and his temperature was checked frequently at the places he goes and he had no fever, and is still not febrile now. He says that he gets a weekly COVID test which allows for him to enter different facilities, and this was the first time in 9 months that he tested positive since this all came out. He says he has worked in some heavy duty places, but he wears his PPE, his respirator, his shield, and still did this stuff after he got the vaccine, he didn&#39;t let his guard down since it might take a while for immunity to kick in, but he still didn&#39;t think that it could be possible to have COVID on Christmas Eve, he was rather surprised he was positive. The patient confirms that he hasn&#39;t had the second dose of the vaccine yet. He says that his diarrhea improved on day or two starting after he had been having bloating on Christmas Eve and Christmas morning. He says his diarrhea resolved, he took no medication for it, and had no change in his heart rate or breathing, no problems anywhere else, he didn&#39;t feel that bad, except for the going to the bathroom. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included sars-cov-2 test: positive on 30Dec2020. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a lack of efficacy with the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 in this subject cannot be completely excluded.  Further information like confirmative virus genome /nucleic acid detection needed for meaningful medical assessment.

I felt heart palpitations and checked my heart rate which was 117, increasing to a max of 123.  I was placed on a pulse ox monitor, which showed 93%, BP was elevated at 146/85. I was not given any  medical treatment, and was placed on a monitor for one hour.  Once my hr and 02 stas were at my baseline, I was allowed to be discharged. I went back to my department and  decided to go home, as I felt tired and was mildly nauseous.

Acetaminophen did alleviate severity of symptoms slightly. Patient had loss of appetite due to AEs experienced. Patient was able to consume water without complications. No mental effects only tiredness from symptoms were experienced.

Unable to eat anything I started to vomit stomach acid. It is now 2 days later and I still have a degree of nausea and am unable to work today. I got the 2nd vaccine on Monday.  It is Wednesday and I still have no appetite for food and have lost about 7 lbs since the weekend. I feel that I am starting to round the corner to recovery though.

                                                Date these symptoms started was 1/27/2021:  About 12 hours after injection, developed fatigue and slight nausea as expected.  Oral temperature 98.0.  Commuted to work without issue. ~ 1400: As day progressed, nausea subsided, but fatigue grew more profound and developed pain in the right subscapular area with exertional shortness of breath walking any length of time. (Injection of initial and second doses were both in right deltoid). 1540 - 1800: Fatigue increased, developed a burning/tearing pain with every yawn and deep breath from the top of my trachea into both left and right mainstem bronchi and radiated to right arm.  It literally felt like someone was trying to tear out my bronchial tree with each breath. 1800: Arrived home and medicated self-medicated with Motrin 400mg. 1800 -2030: rested at home with still some breathing pain, no shortness of breath, but incredibly tired. 2045: Went to bed and slept for the next 12.5 hours without any issued during the night. 0800: Woke up nearly all symptoms were gone, only some minor residual fatigue.  No breathing pain, no nausea, no subscapular pain. I did not seek medical attention for symptoms, nor did I contact my provider. I experienced fatigue and a headache with the first dose, but no other symptoms.  I never experienced fever or chills

At time of reporting (2/9/21 at 1100) client reports progression of swelling from left armpit to left side of stomach. Client reports &#34;it looks like [he&#39;s] gained about 15 pounds on the left side of my body&#34; from armpit to stomach. Client reports he is having no pain or discomfort, but feels &#34;a noticeable pressure from fluid buildup on left side of body.&#34; Client went to see internal medicine physician 2/9/21. Physician was not concerned at current state but instructed client to monitor and call physician if pain occurs or if swelling noticeably worsens. When asked if swelling was worsening each day, client states it is hard to tell due to the shifting of fluid and &#34;maybe settling due to gravity.&#34;

                                                Initial confusion upon waking at 7AM. Uncomfortable but unable to determine why. Tried to re-arrange pillows but could not get arms to complete the process even though fully mobile. A minor amount of weakness in arms/legs and tingling across the lower face, particularly on the right side. Once up, had an inability to form words even though thoughts were coherent. Minor difficulty swallowing water. Speech slurred badly enough to be incomprehensible to my wife. By 7:30 we arrived at the hospital where symptoms were improving.

Dizzy upon standing.  20 minutes post injection paramedics administered 50mg Benadryl  due to difficulty swallowing and sensation of throat closing however it wasn?t worsening.

A 51-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma, dry cough due to inhalation from fires over the years.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Contracted Covid after receiving the first vaccine was reported. The patient received the first dose of the Covid vaccine, then contracted Covid. He now had the option to receive antibodies through plasma. Since he had the vaccine, was that still an option? Or was that a no-no? He received the vaccine at work on 21Dec2020. He got sick on 22Dec2020 and he was at home. He didn&#39;t feel like eating, and can&#39;t lay down because it made it worse to cough. He didn&#39;t know what vitamins they were giving him. The patient probably should be in a hospital, but was not. The outcome of events was not recovered.  Information on Lot/Batch number has been requested.

Should I avoid receiving the second dose?

                                                Received 2nd dose of Pfizer on January 19, 2021.   3 days post vaccination (January 22, 2021) I developed right eye discomfort/irritation,  prickly sensations in throat.     On Jan 25, 2021 I developed tinnitus in right ear  which has still not resolved.     On January 30, 2021, went to ED with elevated BP 170/110, abdominal pain and tinnitus.    Had an abdominal  CT scan with contrast  which showed mesenteric inflammation (idiopathic etiology).   Was seen and evaluated by GI and had colonoscopy and endoscopy with no significant findings.    Took solu-medrol dose pack and abdominal pain symptoms  improved, but still not fully resolved.   On Feb 16 was seen by PCP for persisting, unilateral tinnitus.   Sent for MRI Brain which was normal .   Referred  for further evaluation by audiologist and otolaryngologist .  Was seen on  February 25, 2021 for right ear fullness, tinnitus.    Hearing test normal.   Diagnosed with right sided tinnitus.

A 51-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EZ9261, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, from 01Feb2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included anemia (anemic), inflammation, acid reflux (esophageal), pain, on blood thinner, high cholesterol, sinus disorder (sinuses), overactive bladder/bladder control, acid reflux, stools hard (to soften stool), nerves, blood pressure high (high bp), car accident, and costochondritis in chest. Concomitant medication included atorvastatin calcium for high cholesterol from an unspecified date and ongoing; docusate sodium to soften stool; famotidine to soften stool from an unspecified date and ongoing; garlic [allium sativum] as blood thinner from Nov2020 (3 months ago) and ongoing, gabapentin for nerves from an unspecified date to an unspecified date and from Nov2020 (got back on this 3 months ago) and ongoing; hydrocodone for pain; iron for anemia from Nov2020 (been taking this for the last 3 months) and ongoing; meloxicam for inflammation, omeprazole (PROTONIX) for acid reflux from an unspecified date and ongoing; tadalafil for overactive bladder/bladder control from an unspecified date and ongoing; vitamin c (ascorbic acid), colecalciferol (VITAMIN D), vitamin b for trying to build up his immune system; ranitidine hydrochloride (ZANTAC) for sinuses; &#34;One a Day Men&#39;s&#34; from 2016 and &#34;50&#43;&#34; (as reported, pending clarification). On 01Feb2021, after the shot, the patient experienced dizziness/felt dizzy and had weakness. When he walked to the desk to check out he felt his vision changed and his heart rate went up slightly but it did go down once he sat down but he felt woozy and had pressure in his head and pressure in his hands and feet like he could not move his feet. He was kind of like dizzy and light headed. He walked somewhere to sit down, he stayed 30 minutes and left after and sat 30 minutes in the car and he got a headache and his muscles tightened in his back and in his calf muscles and he felt like he was just not himself. He felt lethargic and felt like his lymph node on his left side was tight throughout his neck. He felt like his lymph node was getting tight and he just sat until he felt like his symptoms had dissipated. He also had lump on his throat. He had stuff going on with his stomach like cringing in his stomach muscles, it was kind of like a muscle spasm in his stomach. He didn&#39;t sleep that well last night (01Feb2021) as he felt some symptoms come on again, the tightness in his neck again and when he sat up, he got dizzy and wobbly, his back was hurting, his calf muscle was tight. He felt more muscle pain. He checked his blood pressure and it was good, but he just felt a little dizzy on 02Feb2021. The patient stated that all his symptoms have improved since 01Feb2021. The patient also mentioned that the girl looked really young (referring to the person who administered the vaccine), &#34;maybe she jacked it up, he knows it supposed to be a very little bit, maybe she put more in him than she was supposed to&#34;. He went back to his doctor as he wants to come off of some of his medications because he is supposed to have another shot and he want to take the second shot. He wanted to stop taking all the medications around the second shot in case it was his medications that caused it. The patient asked since he had complications with the fist dose, should he still take the second dose. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                I had to wait for 15 min and was released. I started getting a really bad headache about 5 min later above my ear. I then got nauseous. I went back to vaccination location and was given a cold compress. I was taken to the ER and given Benadryl and multiple nausea meds. I was there for about 5 hours. I was released and instructed to drink lots of water. I was told by the doctor that my body was doing what it was supposed to do, but to come back if I got worse. I took 2 days off and returned to work with no remaining complications.

A 51-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on left arm on 14Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) at age of 51 years as single dose. The patient medical history and concomitant medications was reported as none. Historical v for covid-19 immunisation accine included the first dose of BNT162B2 administered on left arm on 24Mar2021 at age of 51 years for covid-19 immunisation and experienced no issues. Patient reported that after the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, he had a fever for 8 days and was diagnosed with pneumonia on 21Apr2021. Patient reported that he was tested for both Covid-19, Influenza A, and Influenza B twice on 19Apr2021 and 21Apr2021 and tested negative for Covid-19 and influenza both times. Patient reported that he had no pre-conditions and that he was feeling great the night before he received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, 13Apr2021. Patient reported that he was planning to go to work following the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on 14Apr2021. He began running a low-grade fever (102 degrees) on 14Apr2021 after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine and then his temperature flared up to 103.5 degrees on 15Apr2021. Fever: He received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at 10:45 on 14Apr2021 and about 2:00 in afternoon on 14Apr2021 was the first fever that was significant. The last fever he had on 21Apr2021, his temperature was 103.9. He was put on antibiotics for pneumonia. He contacted the on-call nurse for his company. The on-call nurse advised him to see a doctor on Saturday, 17Apr2021.He went to the doctor on Monday, 19Apr2021. The doctor only ran a Covid-19 swab for testing and a flu swab. His doctor did not do blood work and stated that the patientwas experiencing an ill effect of the Covid-19 vaccine and sent the patient home. He went back to the doctor on Wednesday, 21Apr2021. When he went back to the doctor, the staff performed a chest X-ray and ran 4 different blood works to see what the patient had. The second Covid-19 test that he received on 22Apr2021 was performed with both the rapid test and the test that was sent off. Both Covid-19 tests came back negative. SARS test on 22Apr2021 was negative. 508-3 High Sensitivity CRP: One of his numbers that was parts per liter, 3 is considered to be high risk and he had 300 (300&#43;) of whatever it was on 21Apr2021. He went back to the physician and was given another steroid shot an additional prescription. He had been back to the doctor 3 times since then. Fever: His fever was 103 consistently after 15Apr2021. 508-3 High sensitivity CRP: This value showed abnormal. The results said that relative risk was greater than 1 mg/liter and high was greater than 3. 1000 CBC with auto differential on 21Apr2021: The abnormal results were red blood cells measured at 4.38; hematocrit measured at 13.82; MCHC measured at 36.4; Neutrophils measured at 84; Lymphocytes measured at 12; and absolute Lymphocytes measured at 0.57. He wore a Garmin and that it recorded that he received no more than 2-3 hours of sleep per night for 5 nights. He didn&#39;t know anything about pneumonia previously and that he had specifically told his physician&#39;s office everything about what he was experiencing. He told his physician about the wheezing in his chest (on 17Apr2021), cough (on 16Apr2021), fever, and chills (on 14Apr2021). His physician told him it was a normal reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine and sent him home on 19Apr2021. He then consulted Google and started to realize that his side effect were very atypical. Wheezing: When he breathed really light, the crackling would continue. If he breathed shallow, the wheezing was audible but if he breathed deeply, it was not. The pneumonia was in the left side of his chest. He was still being treated for the pneumonia. He has his last dose of medication tomorrow, 27Apr2021, and that he was also being released to go back to work tomorrow. Cough: He had a little cough that would then go away. The cough began late Friday, 16Apr2021. It was interesting because it wasn&#39;t a main part of the illness. The cough was just kind of a hacking cough every once in awhile. The cough was not continuous like go and go and go and stop. The cough came, went away for awhile, then came again.The cough being worse was relative. He was coughing more than he did on Wednesday 21Apr2021, Thursday 22Apr2021, and Friday 23Apr2021. The cough was consistent more so at night when he laid down. He would probably say that it was a different feel towards the cough but it was still a cough. The cough was still the same volume but not the same effect. Headache (on 18Apr2021): He had been waking up with headaches in the morning and going to bed with them at night. On Wednesday, 21Apr2021, the headache was due to dehydration from the fever and night sweats. Once he got away from the dehydration headaches, the headache got better but he had woken up with a headache the last few days and had a headache at bedtime a few nights in a row. The headache was usually a frontal headache and this morning, 26Apr2021, the headache was toward the back of his head. The headaches last a few hours until he started moving around. On Saturday, 17Apr2021 he experienced a migraine that would not go away. He didn&#39;t usually get migraines. The migraine lasted hours if not for a day and that the headache was something furious. Sunday 18Apr2021 was pretty much the same thing with the headache. Because of the massive fever, he couldn&#39;t eat anything at all (17Apr2021). The headache was mostly due to low blood sugar and dehydration. Appetite: His appetite improved after his second doctor&#39;s appointment on 21Apr2021. The second provider was a lot more straightforward and advised the patient that he needed to start taking care of himself and trying to force himself to eat. He forced himself to eat on 21Apr2021 and by Thursday 22Apr2021, he had a full appetite and was craving food again. Shortness of breath (Apr2021): Patient reported that the shortness of breath was just from being fatigued. Patient reported that he got out of breath from going up and down the stairs. He was unsure when the shortness of breath began because he was moving very little, but that he noticed the shortness of breath on Monday, 19Apr2021 when he got up to go to the doctor.On Friday 16Apr2021 and Saturday 17Apr2021, he had a really good break.On Friday 16Apr2021 from 9 AM to 1 PM, he had no fever and it was like the sun was coming out, then the fever hit really hard. The same thing happened on Saturday, 17Apr2021, but the fever free period lasted maybe a little longer. His fever returned and that the afternoon of Saturday 17Apr2021 was the worst he had been the entire time. On 13Apr2021 to get away from arm soreness, he did a few laps in the pool. On 13Apr2021 he had a new best time on the 100 in freestyle in the pool and that he felt really strong going into 14Apr2021 to get his second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. There was nothing that would have indicated that he had anything going on before getting the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Up until Saturday, 17Apr2021, he had only been taking Motrin and just taking 2 tablets. He had no break in between fevers and chills and was not able to get ahead of the fever with the Motrin. There was a long stretch where the Motrin wasn&#39;t working and his temperature didn&#39;t get below 100 for several days. He tried to cycle acetaminophen in beginning Saturday 17Apr2021 to try to get the acetaminophen in between the Motrin doses.  When he went back to the doctor on 21Apr2021, the provider told him that he could take 3 to 4 Motrin tablets at a time but not to exceed 4 doses per day. He never took more than 3 tablets. Motrin was generic ibuprofen. Night sweats (on 21Apr2021): The last couple of nights have been the same. He had a fan on to keep a little cooler and that it was 61 degrees outside and he felt the night sweats. He had a buckwheat mat that was cool that he put on the floor to stay cooler with the night sweats. Come Thursday, 22Apr2021, he said we&#39;re done with this and he couldn&#39;t sleep from it (Apr2021). Last night, 25Apr2021, he knew that he had night sweats because he was sweating at night and the temperature in the room was 64 degrees. AEs did not require a visit to Emergency Room. AEs required a visit to Physician Office for fever, wheezing, cough, shortness of breath, chills. Outcome of events was unknown.

My fever was 102.8 when I first woke up. I was very nauseous and my fever felt worse. My thermometer would not read any more until my temp came down. I can only guess how high it got but at least 103 degrees. I took Advil Liquid Gells and then my fever broke. I was actually scare for my life. In March I actually caught coronavirus and developed  anti bodies for Covid. I can only guess my body was fighting for it&#39;s life.

Slept very soundly that night.  For the rest of the week, I needed a 5 to 6 hrs extra sleep every day.  I missed a week of work because of fatigue.  On 3rd and 4th days after shot I had diarrhea. On 3rd and 4th days after shot I had slight nausea.  Slight ringing in ears on days 2, 3, and 4 after shot.  Only slight fatigue on 5th day after shot. All other symptoms gone.  6th day after shot all symptoms gone. I feel fine. I&#39;m glad I was vaccinated.

A 52-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELO140) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 11Jan2021 at 9:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included Covid-19 from 17Jul2020 to 14Aug2020, he didn&#39;t get hospitalized but was pretty sick. He had circulation issues with it. He had numbing and tingling in his left three fingers (clarified left three fingers as his middle finger, index finger, and ring finger) and numbing and tingling in his toes as well. Concomitant medications included ubidecarenone (COQ-10), acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN), rosuvastatin and monascus purpureus (RED YEAST RICE). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 at the age of 52 years old on 23Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. With second dose the patient thought he would be better, but about 12 hours later he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm. He checked his body temperature and he didn&#39;t have a temp. His temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit. He tried to keep himself warm. He got nauseous with it. Basically he looked on line and was having them. Today he started to feel better, but still a little nauseous. He had severe fatigue. He didn&#39;t realize he could go fill out something on the website for CDC. He knew he had wanted the vaccine because he had some severe symptoms when he had COVID. He didn&#39;t want to get COVID again. His hospital frustrates him sometimes. They didn&#39;t put the date on there when he was to come back for the second dose. They didn&#39;t tell him to come back on the 13th. He had to figure the dates from the website and emails. He talked it over with his wife. He came in contact with it every night. He was taking care of people that were critical. He worked in the intensive care unit. Even the people he took care of that didn&#39;t have it, ended up with it. He wore a mask. He used hand sanitizer. He didn&#39;t want to get it again. People were shocked when he got it the first time. He did verify that he got the second dose one day sooner, instead of the three day window. He was sick with the first and was expecting to be more sick with this one. He wanted to give himself an extra day before he had to go back to work. He had a couple of emails where they discussed increasing the window to do it a day sooner. He was going to have to go an hour an half a way to get the second dose and he didn&#39;t want to do that. The patient underwent lab test included height was approximately six two, weight was about 194 lbs on an unspecified date, and body temperature showed 96 degrees Fahrenheit in Jan2021. The outcome of the event he got real cold and shaky and couldn&#39;t get warm, temperature was low at 96 degrees Fahrenheit was recovering, for the events he got nauseous with it and he had severe fatigue were not recovered.

                                                I contracted Covid 19 in mid October 2020 and I lost my sense of smell and taste.  It took a long time to start coming back and was at about 60% of normal when I received the 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine.  Four days after the shot my sense of smell and taste changed.  From that day until present almost everything I smell and taste has a &#34;chemical&#34; taste and smell.  Nothing smells normal and very few things taste good.  Animal proteins are especially bad as well as some fruits and vegetables.  Most foods make my stomach so upset that it is nearly impossible to eat.  All smells are the same, nothing smells pleasant and most smells give me a light headache.  I have lost over ten pounds since this started and I have general malaise.

Duration of about an hour after washing face and flushing eyes with warm tap water. Rinsed mouth with antiseptic and drank plenty of water. Things I know to do when anything I&#39;ve ingested sparks the warning signs with the tearing up of the left eye. Since I cannot afford Epipens, I wonder if it would have helped if I was not able to breath during this reaction?

And then my fever went down and I felt pretty good but still experiencing some low grade fatigue and a little congestion which is lingering from first dose. Lingering effects may be from COVID

                                                1st symptom: Within 30 seconds, ache in arm from elbow to wrist.  Got worse over next few minutes, fairly uncomfortable for about 45 minutes before subsiding slightly (tried to keep moving arm as recommended).  Pain returned when I drove to work and while at my desk.  Lasted for approx 4 more hours.  Injection at 11:15am, pain mostly ended around 9:30pm (except when reaching or extending arm, pain in shoulder now mostly). 2nd symptom: Mild nausea starting about 5 min after injection, while in waiting room.  Passed when laying down at home before work, approx 45 min later..  Started again while driving to work and lasted from about 4pm to 8pm.  Subsided about 10pm.   3rd symptom - feel very fatigued.at typing of this report at 10pm - started about 5pm. So far nothing else - no headache or chills for example.  No pain at all at the actual injection site - now the pain is mostly above it - from the shoulder joint to near the injection site (maybe a couple inches above.) as well as the forearm, all around.   To make coping easier in case the symptoms (arm ache, fatigue, etc) are worse as commonly described from the 2nd dose I put in and was approved for PTO from work for scheduled 2nd date on  March 30th.   Will allow me to rest (avoid being effected at work with the fatigue and an even more achy arm as expected side effects of 2nd dose)

A 53-year-old male patient received the second dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot number was not reported) via an unspecified route of administration on 23Mar2021 at age of 53-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included autoimmune autonomic disorder, Sjogren&#39;s disease, Crohn&#39;s (in remission 3 decades), COVID, known allergies: Ototoxic reaction to clarithromycin (BIAXIN), also skin rash to levofloxacin (LEVAQUIN) and ciprofloxacin (CIPRO). Concomitant medication included doxycycline taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified date. No other vaccine was used in four weeks. No COVID tested post vaccination. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 01Mar2021 06:45 PM at age of 53-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation. Approximately 4 days after the first COVID shot (05Mar2021), the patient developed constipation. This constipation continued and worsened 4 days after his second Pfizer shot (27Mar2021). On 23Mar2021, the patient developed tinnitus and a very dry mouth. Coincident with the dry mouth, the top of his tongue had turned white and he have developed a serious taste distortion in his mouth. The constipation initially partially responded to laxatives between the first and second vaccinations, but starting 4 after the second vaccination, the laxatives have stopped working. The events were resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care, Disability or permanent damage. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included abdominal CT, blood tests, hearing test, all with unknown results. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 54-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, on 04Jan2021 (at the age of 54-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes and high blood pressure. Concomitant medications included metformin (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, glimepiride (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) taken for diabetes, lisinopril (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN), and amlodipine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN). The patient experienced not feeling well, ate a bit but not much, kind of pale, vomiting, trouble in breathing, and agitated on 04Jan2021; body was hyper dried and restless on 05Jan2021; mind just seemed like it was racing on 06Jan2021; and not responsive and he passed away on 06Jan2021 at 10:15 (reported as: around 10:15 AM).

When the patient was awoken at 6:00 AM in the morning, he was still agitated. The patient stated that he couldn&#39;t breathe, and his mind was racing. The patient&#39;s other brother went to him and he was not responsive, and he passed away on 06Jan2021 around 10:15 AM. It was reported that none of the symptoms occurred until the patient received the vaccine. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting as aforementioned. The clinical outcome of all of the events was unknown; not responsive was not recovered, the patient died on 06Jan2021. The cause of death was unknown (reported as: not known by reporter). An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and has been requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: not responsive and he passed away

I lost 6 pounds.  After continuing with some diarrhea all day on February 12th, I began having bloody mucous chunks as my stool.  I was advised by my doctor to go to the ER.  I was diagnosed with colitis in the ER and was admitted for several days for treatment due to the severe blood coming out.  CT scan showed severe inflammation, and stool sample showed blood and lactoferrin marker high.  I was given many antibiotics and fluids and was released home on February 14th, 2021.  I am still receiving treatment with oral antibiotics, and appointments with my physician.  I had to be absent from work for over 7 days.

Once he received the vaccine he asked to use the bathroom and while he was in there he felt nauseous and came out of the bathroom. He then felt extremely light headed and nauseous that he almost collapsed to the floor. The pharmacist and myself (an immunizing pharmacy intern) rushed to check on him. He reported a little difficulty breathing but was still conscious. We proceeded to call 911 and gave one dose of 0.3 mg Epi-pen. After about 5 minutes he felt much better and was able to sit up. He reported that he never lost complete consciousness but was extremely nauseous and lightheaded. Patient handed over to EMS.

After laying on floor, was able to speak and crawled back to bed.   Vomited one more time  around 10 am.   Was in bed until 4:00 pm. Symptoms subsided by then, but I did not feel well until the next morning.   The vertigo and nausea were the most severe I have ever had.   At no point was I running a fever..

                                                This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 54-year-old male patient (height: 193cm, weight: 99.79kg) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6207) via an unspecified route of administration at right upper arm on 18Mar2021 18:00 (54-year-old at time of vaccination), at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, teeth cleaned (Shortly before the shot, went to the dentist to have teeth cleaned. Directly from Dentist went to pharmacy. Went to pharmacy&#39;s Drive Thru to pick up a little antibiotic from the dentist. It was 4 capsules of Amoxicillin. He was supposed to take the Amoxicillin before the dentist office visit, but he forgot to do that. Therefore, soon as he left the dentist office he went to pharmacy to pick it up so he could take it. While he was there, was offered the COVID 19 vaccine and that it was the last shot). Concomitant medications included atenolol tablet from 2016 (been taking for 5 years) and ongoing for blood pressure, and ascorbic acid/ cyanocobalamin/ ergocalciferol/ nicotinamide/ pyridoxine hydrochloride/ retinol/ riboflavin/ thiamine mononitrate (ONE-A-DAY). No additional vaccines administered on same date. No history of all previously immunizations. No prior vaccincations wtihin 4 weeks. He got the shot Thursday and by Sunday, many different side effects were coming in. He has had side effects from the COVID VACCINE, but initially he does not want to file report, just thinks that everyone needs to get the shot. He does not have complaints. He is wondering how long the side effects will last, and when they go away. States that he is being treated as he has gone to the doctor&#39;s. Also states that he made an appointment with the doctor and almost went to the emergency room a couple of times. Right after the shot, he was getting in the car and his right leg started hurting (on 18Mar2021). It didn&#39;t go away for a couple of days. It went away but then noticed his shoes started feeling funny. He wasn&#39;t looking at his feet, put his shoes on they felt tight. Then he started to look at feet more. Below his knees, his legs are swollen. Swelling started within 2 to 3 days after the vaccine. The swelling is really severe when standing. Everybody at work has seen how sick he is and his legs. Swelling in the legs has him concerned, thinking maybe it&#39;s a blood clot. He was given medicine and would like to see it go away. He keeps his legs up. He has other side effects (all in Mar2021) and is having flu like symptoms. He basically has the flu. He has never had the flu shot. This is the first flu shot (He referred to the COVID vaccine as the flu shot as documented. However, confirmed suspect product as Pfizer covid vaccine) he has had that he knows of. He is questioning if he should get the second shot. He feels a little dizzy. Quick questions get him confused and that it comes and goes. Lungs felt full, gasping for air: not now but, since the doctor gave him antibiotics (unspecified injections, he was given 2 shots at the doctor&#39;s office, one in each arm), his lungs felt full. At times he was gasping for air. It went away but thought he was going to die. Now when he gets winded, it feels like he has a dry cough. Gets winded easily. The doctor ordered him an inhaler, Symbicort, but it was very expensive, so he did not get it at that time. He never picked it up because it was too much money. The fluid is not there anymore and he does not feel like he needs this as does not feel like it needs to be cleared. He is having wheezing. He can now take deeper breaths. Fatigue: initially, that he was feeling tired within 1 or 2 days, but he did not recall the next day feeling that way (later stated it was within 2-3 days he started to feel tired). He is still tired. Unable to clarify time frame of fatigue further. He feels bloated and full. Hasn&#39;t really eaten but feels real full and bloated. Hot and cold flashes started occurring about the same time as the other symptoms. He had these last evening. He does not get the flu very often and doesn&#39;t take the Flu shot. This is the closest thing he can remember having a pretty good episode with the flu. He was also given prescriptions for 2 new medications: Triamterene 37.5mg daily, for leg swelling; Clindamycin, 300mg, twice a day, an antibiotic. The odd thing is that it seems like his eyes are big, like really, really big, like they are really open. It is like big eye balls. States that he is just sick and his body is reacting to getting better. He has not been to work in the last 3 days. States that he is fine, just worried about work. Patient asked for personal advice about going back to work. The outcome of &#34;his right leg started hurting&#34; was recovered; outcome of &#34;below his knees, his legs are swollen/ swelling in the legs/ put his shoes on they felt tight&#34; and Fatigue/feeling tired was not recovered; outcome of other events was unknown.

A 54-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE) (lot number/expiration date: not provided), via an unspecified route of administration, on 24Mar2021 at 14:30 (at the age of 54 years old) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION. Relevant medical history included benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and cholesterol. The patient was diagnosed with BPH a few years back 2016 or 2017 and had a uralist in 2019 and that resolved his issues. The patient had been on no BPH meds and back to normal since that procedure. Co-suspect medication included atorvastatin (LIPITOR) from an unknown date to 01Apr2021 at 40 mg, 1x/day for blood cholesterol. On an unspecified date in Mar2021, the patient experienced prostate infections, and abdominal discomfort. On 25Mar2021, the patient experienced arm pain, and was lightheaded. He described the arm pain as he had deltoid pain but he also had pain like he had been hit from his right pectoral down his arm to about 4-5 inches above his wrist. On 31Mar2021, the patient experienced couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, sweat, urinating blood, and dark colored urine. The patient was concerned with the dark urine so he stopped taking atorvastatin, and called his physician who said he didn&#39;t need it anyhow. The patient visited the urologist office and was prescribed ciprofloxacin (CIPRO) as treatment for dark colored urine, urinating blood and prostate infection. On 06Apr2021, the patient experienced leukocytes in urine. Relevant lab data on 06Apr2021 included a urinalysis which resulted in leukocytes and blood &#43;3. The action taken in response to the event dark urine with atorvastatin was permanently withdrawn. The outcome of the events prostate infection, and abdominal discomfort was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events arm pain, and lightheaded was recovered in 26Mar2021. The outcome of the events couldn&#39;t sleep, anxiety, and sweat was recovered on 01Apr2021. The outcome of the events urinating blood and dark colored urine was recovered on 06Apr2021. The outcome of the event leukocytes in urine was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information, the serious events Prostate infection, Blood in urine, and Urine color abnormal are most likely related to an intercurrent or underlying condition which is not related to the suspected drugs. Relevant medical history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) may provide a plausible explanation for the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021450744 same patient/SD, different AE/dose

                                                Diffuse abdominal pain onset approximately 10-12 hr post dose.  I was initially awoken that first night with nausea and abdominal pain. This continued through 1/22/21. My nausea had subsided and I was able to eat in small quantities. My abdomen felt bloat with mild distention. The AM of 1/23/21, I awoke and the diffuse abdominal pain had abated. I was left with RLQ abdominal pinpoint pain. This became progressively worse throughout the day. I presented to the ER on 1/23/21. Chem panel was normal. CBC also normal.   I received an abdominal CT scan with IV contrast for R/O appy. My appendix was normal. The scan revealed a serosal venous thrombophlebitis wth inflammation in the mesentery and transverse colitis.  The pain continued to progress, so I presented to the ER again on 1/25/21.  I received another abdominal CT along with additional lab work.  Lactate normal. D-Dimer mildly elevated at 0.7 and CRP was 9.7. Again CBC was normal. This CT did not reveal the micro-emboli or colits but rather omental inflammation.  At this point, surgery was consulted along with hematology for opinion regarding anticoagulation. The decision to anti coagulate was deferred. The diagnosis I received was omental infarct.  I remain on pain medications and continue to monitor for changes in my pain and a fever.

A 55-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EL3246), intramuscular on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 12Jan2021, the evening after the vaccine was administered, the patient experienced chills, bone aches, and minor HA that then worsened to explosive diarrhea and violent vomiting with a jaundice color of skin. The events resulted in a doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

V/S stable, afebrile in ED.  Assess for infection.   No significant abnormal labs (see below), hydrated and discharged.   2/4/2021-  arrived in ED with c/o vomiting, seen earlier by PCP that day labs drawn.  Shortly after arriving in the ED copious amouts of emesis noted, the patient went into full cardiac arrest and CPR was started.   -Please see HPI above, in addition after intubation the patient coded again.  More epinephrine and lidocaine were given.  CPR was resumed.  We did obtain ROSC and targeted temperature management was pursued.  He is placed on a lidocaine drip and a right femoral central line was placed by myself.  At this time, norepinephrine drip was initiated given his continued hypotension.  Post intubation chest x-ray suggests possible abdominal pathology and once the patient was stabilized further, he was sent to the CT scanner where CT head without IV contrast and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was obtained.  He did lose pulses once in the radiology suite.  This was brief.  IV fluids were initiated and he received over 2 L of crystalloid therapy.  He continued to be hypotensive in the emergency department and vasopressin was added.  He also had a single dose of Neo-Synephrine and IV push fashion to help bring his blood pressure up.  CT scan reveals probable bilateral aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point and pneumatosis involving loops in the left upper quadrant.  I did try to initiate consult with critical care and possible transfer, however he continued to be unstable and coded requiring CPR multiple times.  He was given IV bicarbonate given his prolonged CPR state and pH.  Ultimately, the family decided to make the patient comfort measures only given his critical illness.  Shortly after making this decision he did pass away in the emergency department.

Shortly after the metallic taste started, saliva production decreased causing severe dry mouth and it became difficult to swallow.  I went to the closest hospital which was approximately a 10 minute drive from when symptoms started and explained what was going on to the person at the triage desk.  I did NOT request to be seen by a doctor because symptoms had started to lesson but I did wait at the ER since it was a public place for approximately 30 minutes before traveling home.  Approximately 2 hours after onset of symptoms, saliva production had returned to normal levels.

A 55-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number was not reported, expiration date: 28Mar2021) via an unspecified route of administration on left arm 24Mar2021 10:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included cytomegalovirus from on an unspecified date 2010 and Palpitations. The concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported, he has gained back a pound and that he is starting on the road to recovery in the last week. Stiff right arm lasted the first and second week. It started the first day of when he got the shot. The next morning, he calls a thrashing event where he felt like his limbs would not work. They did work, but it felt like he needed to move them around. He was thrashing in bed and making the motion with his big joints, then getting into the small joints. It was his arms and legs. Over the course of like an hour, his heart rate went up to like 120. He does not qualify this as racing, but his heartrate is normally 60. This was several times over the course of the first week so it would have been around 04Apr2021 or 03Apr2021. Events occurred 9 days later, which is what he is considering this first week. His left arm was where he got the vaccine, but his right arm was stiff. He felt like he was going to die 5 times. He also had extreme fatigue. He never went to the emergency room. At this time, his glucose was high and his zinc was low. The doctor thinks the extreme fatigue was the antibodies reacted to the cytomegalovirus. He adds that the back of his knees was cramping in the first and second week. In the right arm, he had some small very small bruises. His forearms did not feel like his blood was right.

This 55-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) in his left arm on 05Apr2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Arthritis, Sinus problem, Asthma, Bipolar disorder. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on unspecified date at age of 55 years old for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced injection site pain, severe pain in his left shoulder after that second dose. Some major pain up around his shoulders and around the back of neck, his left side was worst. He said that the pain was shooting down to his heart. So he went to the hospital because he thought it was something to the heart. They tested him, they evaluated him but they ruled out anything that has to do with the heart. They checked his heart, he had a cardiac catheterization, and was ruled out, everything came out negative.  So, he just got out of hospital and was still developing the pain and it&#39;s on his left side, it&#39;s on his right side (as reported). He called all his doctors, they had no answers for him, now he was still in a lot of pain in both of shoulders like he was saying his left side was still the worst, and it has not gone away and the pain is still shooting down around his heart and shooting down around the back of neck and now it&#39;s going on the top of his legs.  He went to the bone doctor and he was getting an MRI done, because the doctors said nothing was torn in his arms or tissues. He stated the pain was around his arms, back and wraps down to the heart. He was in dire pain, 8.5/10 and had a feeling of it was related to the vaccine. He clarified the pain was in both shoulders and the left side was worse and that was the side he had his shot on.  Patient stated he had stomach problems, he was collapsed stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EH9899), via intramuscular route on 17Dec2020 at single dose (dose 1, left deltoid) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included non-smoker. Concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient was scheduled to take the second dose on 05Jan2021, also reported as 08Jan2021. The patient experienced sore arm for 24 hours afterwards on Dec2020. Patient experienced mild COVID symptoms such as fever, chills, sore throat, cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, and tiny bit of shortness of breath on 24Dec2020, but stated he was better now. The patient was positive in the COVID test on 28Dec2020. He wanted to know if it was normal to get COVID after getting the vaccine and if he should get the booster shot if he gets better.  He commented that testing positive for COVID was medically concerning. The patient did not require supplemental oxygen (including high flow ECMO) or receive a mechanical ventilation. Treatment included over the counter medication. No additional testing was done. The patient was not hospitalized. Outcome of the event sore arm was unknown; cough was not recovered; fever, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion, runny nose, little diarrhea, tiny bit of shortness of breath was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number was already obtained. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 virus test positive cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

A contactable nurse and contactable consumer (patient) reported that a 56-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and tofacitinib citrate (XELJANZ XR), orally from 02Oct2020 at 11 mg, daily for rheumatoid arthritis. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  On 19Dec2020, the patient experienced neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare.  In Dec2020, the patient experienced increase in joint pain from his baseline. The physician was aware. The patient was placed on unspecified steroids for the events, neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare which minimized symptoms. While weaning off steroids, the severity of symptoms returned. The patient was instructed by the doctor to stop taking tofacitinib citrate which was stopped on 29Dec2020. The action taken in response to the events for BNT162B2 was not applicable and for tofacitinib citrate was permanently withdrawn on 29Dec2020.  The patient reported slight improvement after stopping tofacitinib citrate.  The outcome of neuropathy, pain, nausea, fatigue, bone, muscle, stomach pain and flare was recovering and of increase in joint pain from his baseline was unknown.  The batch/lot number for the vaccine, BNT162B2, was not provided and will be requested during follow-up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, the reported events are most likely due to patient underlying contributory factors and unlikely that it is related to the suspect product. However due to temporal association with the vaccine, a possible contributory role of vaccine cannot be ruled out. Case will be reevaluated based on additional information during the follow-up.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators as appropriate.

A 56-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- ER8727), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 24Mar2021 at 10.30 (at the age of 56-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension diagnosed 20 years ago, blood cholesterol diagnosed about 7 years ago, Covid-19 in Dec2020 which hit him pretty hard, double pneumonia, he was wiped out, patient had a shingles vaccine a couple of years ago he had a fever and it felt like he had the flu, for about 48 hours he was wiped out. This happened with both doses of the shingles vaccine. Concomitant medication(s) included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). On 24Mar2021 (Wednesday), patient experienced double pneumonia, body aches/i started aching, my arm hurt, headache, tired/fatigue/exhausted, i got the chills, my skin felt like it was sunburned, cough, fog, no appetite, sweating, sore arm, he had a previous flu like symptoms after the shingles vaccine. It was reported that all the same symptoms the patient had with COVID, the caller had after the vaccine. The next morning was much worse and through that next day. Patient describes his side effects like a mini Covid 19 reaction. The symptoms were very similar to the symptoms he had 4 days into his Covid-19 diagnosis. It was reported that on Friday (26Mar2021) he felt normal and was able to workout on Saturday (27Mar2021) as usual. The patient believes his antibodies are strong following his virus and then the 1st Pfizer vaccine dose. The patient doesn&#39;t think he had a fever, but he didn&#39;t have that with covid along with no loss of taste and smell. The patient was very grateful for the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccinations within 4 weeks prior vaccination. The patient underwent lab tests which included blood cholesterol and blood pressure whose results are reported as high on an unknown date. The outcome of the event double pneumonia was unknown, and for all other events it was recovered.

                                                Experienced a delayed reaction to vaccine that occurred at 11 p. m.  Administration was at 8:23 a. m. earlier in the day.  Symptoms began as build up of mucous in back of throat and reflux. Very early the next morning symptoms progressed to near inability to swallow,    Took 50 mg of Benadryl which gave a bit of relief.  Very hard to drink the water and get it down with the two pills.  The symptoms included swollen lips and inside of the mouth swelling.  Went to the emergency room at the Clinic  at 7:30 a. m.   I was given 60 mg of Prednisone, Pepsid to coat the stomach re the steroids. Was sent home with prescription for epi pen, medrol dose pack, Pepsid and Zyrtec.  Symptoms improved except for swelling of lips.  However, on 3/11/21, despite taking the medication, the symptoms worsened in terms of renewed lip swell as well as new symptoms of facial flushing and chest flushing.  Symptoms then abated with medication.  On 3/13/21, symptoms flared again with renewed lip swelling, inside and outside check swelling and outside face and chest flushing.  They they abated again with medication.  On 3/14/21, lip swelling renewed as a symptom.  To date, my lips do not feel right but tingly and bloated and irritated.  Saw an allergist this morning who thinks I am allergic to polyglycol a preservative in the vaccine.

Brief history and medical decision making: s/p bilateral lung transplant for bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma complicated by bilateral loculated pleural effusion, DVT on eliquis presenting post syncopal event.  Syncopal event without evidence of seizure like activity, fast recovery, and no sudden changes consistent with an acute cardiac event. Thus symptoms were likely due to vasovagal event possibly post COVID_19 related side effect (headache, achy muscles, not feeling well overall). He has no neurologic deficit, CTA thorax without PE, negative EKG, troponin and echocardiogram. He is not on antihypertensives and blood pressures have been normal. Given his initial diagnosis of BAC, there may be concern for metastatic disease, though symptoms have not persisted and he has no focal deficit. He also received contrast for his CTA today, thus will defer further imaging for now.   Syncope: - defer 2nd dose of COVID-19 vaccine as its effectiveness in transplant patient is not established and patient potentially had an adverse event.  - oral hydration encouraged - monitor for additional ongoing neurologic symptoms such as headaches, vision changes, neck stiffness, fevers, night sweats, weight loss, weakness or paraesthesias - patient advised to avoid driving until further evaluation - consider MRI brain with and without contrast if any symptoms persist or reoccur   Complex loculated pleural effusion

Most problematic has been the re-emergence of a long dormant auto-immune disorder (12&#43; yrs), bullous pemphigus. This disorder, when active, causes blistering and sloughing skin in soft tissue areas. It can be very painful and uncomfortable. It usually emerges when I have a significant event that causes my immune system to plummet. I fully believe this vaccine precipitated this occurrence.

Most problematic was activation of a long dormant (over 12 years) auto-immune disorder, bullous pemphigus, which attacks soft tissue areas on the body with blisters and sloughing skin. This is a very uncomfortable experience to go through. The patient&#39;s healthcare provider is aware and treating him for such.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of day 1-4 was significant fatigue and headache, day 5-8 was intense gi distress with stabbing stomach pain and general malaise. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

He was acutely distressed. He was treated with IV benadryl and IM epinephrine. The difficulty swallowing resolved, but chest tightness persisted. Trial of nitroglycerin did not improve his pain so pt was given IV hydromorphone. After approximately 10 minutes he was  relaxed and breathing comfortably, but still endorsing chest pain.

                                                Within a minute of receiving vaccine I felt a very cold lump/ feeling in my throat that got worse over the next few minutes making it difficult to swallow.  At the same time I felt very fuzzy and numb all over my face and body and very light headed.  My arms and legs felt very heavy.  The EMT took my blood pressure and told me it was 174/125.  My normal BP is 110/60.  I have had my BP taken once a month over last 20 years at my monthly pain center appointments.  They hooked me up to a 4 lead cardiac monitor and said I had  A -Fib. They then hooked me up to a 12 lead ekg  monitor and said I didn?t have A-Fib.  I have had 3 EKG?s in last year because I was scheduled to have total knee replacement surgery which was rescheduled 2 times and all 3 EKG?s were completely normal.  After about 1 hour my symptoms improved to the point where I could go home.   I Have had between 20-30 knee procedures over the last 40 years and my reaction to the vaccine felt exactly like I was being put to sleep by sodium pentothal or a very high dose of Versed.

He said his lower body felt like he&#39;d been in a car accident. He couldn&#39;t keep anything down to take pain medicine all day long so was miserable all day until about 4pm when he was able to drink some water and take some Vicodin, which did not help. He was up and down all night long with the headache and body aches, and I gave him Excedrin about 6am and that finally started alleviating the headache. He took it again at 11am and was able to eat then, and is gradually been feeling better throughout the day. He was finally able to take his regular meds so now the body aches have subsided (48 hours after injection/36 hours after onset of symptoms).

                                                Developed fever of 101-103, violent chills, uncontrolled shaking and extreme headache.  Lasted 3 solid, then fever began to drop day 4, but headache persisted along with sweats and violent chill. No real appetite.  Also experienced body ache, but not as bad as other symptoms.  No, or little bowel movement during this time.  On day five (today) urine output is dark, but went 18 hours without Tylenol.  Piot to that i need 2 extra strength Tylenol every 5 hours for 4 days straight.  No nausea or vomiting associated with any of this.  I have extreme fatigue due the extreme headache pain keeping me awake.  Headache on the left and right side of the head, not front or behine the eyes, more over the ears.  Today I just feel wiped out by it all, but much improved.  I have never had any reaction to any vaccines previously, including allergy, flu, shingles and pneumonia.

                                                Excruciating pain in ALL o my body.  The vaccine has triggered a Fibromyalgia episode from hell.  Extreme pain in ALL of my body.  It feels like all my nerve endings are on fire.  And when they are not on fire, they itch so bad, and I have scratched them so much, I have sores and scabs on my arms and legs from scratching a itch I can not reach.  Feels like the itching is under my skin.  Not on top.   1) Pain in ALL my body 2) High temperature - my house is 91 degrees and I&#39;m in a blanket and I&#34;m still cold 3) Even though I&#39;m cold - I sweat a lot 4) Have not been able to eat since I got the vaccine 8 days ago - growing very weak and loosing weight 5) I&#39;m dehydrated - Having trouble keeping liquids down 6) Bad stomach pains - sharp pains 7) Real bad gas and lots of it - Not normal for me 8) My kidneys hurt real bad - Probably clogged and overworked      I spend most of my time on the floor n my back.  Hurts too much to stand and walk   NOTE:  I&#39;m growing weak and very dehydrated.                   Something needs to be done soon !

I had not been able to keep down food in 10 days and for 3 days could not keep down liquids, so I went to the E/R. Pulse was down to 37bpm.  Blood had a high clotting factor as was starting to clot. Every nerve in my body felt like it was being electrified while on Fire at the same time!  Acute pain in my heart - Thought I was having a heart attack. High fever with chills and sweats.  Extreme dehydration.  And my kidneys hurt like hell.  They are taxed working overtime.   I was in such extreme pain, they had to shoot me up with Morphine every 4 hours to get it under control. They had to administer blood thinners to prevent clots.  I&#39;m still on blood thinners thanks to this damn vaccine! I was so dehydrated, they gave me 5 bags of IV Saline, a picture of Ice,  a picture of Water, then a picture of Tea, before I could even urinate.    I got to the E/R just in time before my heart stopped,  or before a clot formed and killed me.  Was in the hospital for 2 days.    I&#39;m home now, but still in pain.  I can&#39;t eat but force myself to drink liquids.  I do know if I will be getting any more vaccines...

                                                Had my 2nd COVID vaccination shot at 2 pm on Monday, January 11, 2021.    Next morning - moderate pain in upper left arm/shoulder (place of injection). Working full shift.    Around 4 pm on Tuesday (after almost 3hrs OR case) - feeling very tired. Completed the working shift at 6 pm. Minor to moderate headache started to develop later in the evening. Two pills of Tylenol at 9 pm, another two around 2 am - while headache was getting worse.  @6:30 am Wednesday - informed managers that I&#39;ll have to stay off work because of bad headache (7 to 8 from 10), called EH as well.    During the day - mostly staying in the bed. Tylenol, water, tea with lemon, apples for hydration. Headache -- up and down (between 4 and 8), occasional fatigue and nausea (after staying upright more than 10-15 minutes), left upper arm pain, moderate pain in joints (knees, hips, low back). No fever.   Troubled night-time sleeping because of headache. 7 am - informed managers and EH about my condition, Got approval for another day off - with request to have a C-Test after that. Similar feeling and treatment.    Slow improvement during the day. Around 5 pm - feeling good enough to start moving more actively, headache and shoulder pain on low level, though getting tired quickly still.    Much better sleeping. No symptoms in the morning. Had a COVID test before returning to work.

Around 6 pm on the day of the injection I noticed that my taste buds were more sensitive. Following that I became very sluggish. So I went to bed shortly afterwards. The following morning I was still sluggish and there was a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. The feeling of tiredness an no energy started and continued until Wednesday the 3rd of March.  That morning I awaken feeling better. I still have a feeling of openness in my upper chest area. But overall I feel great.

Face and neck were turning purple. My dad was about to call 911 when he finally was able to calm down and catch his breath. His lungs and chest burned afterwards and he was completely spent for days after.

Two workers (from the mental health day program, he went to before the covid lockdown) both advised him to get the second injection, however, and he complied.  After injection he had episodes of difficulty breathing and vomiting for several nights.  Soon after that, he started having to go to the emergency room for blood sugars over 500 (prior to injection his diabetes had been controllable at care home). When he went to ER (for high blood sugar) March 18th, his heart stopped and could not be re-started.  He died.

A 59-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 27Mar2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 for Covid-19 immunization on an unspecified date. He reported that on 27Mar2021 he got the 2nd COVID Pfizer shot and has increased on fatigue now and cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, also reported some abdominal swelling, none in legs. He reported weight gain but can la flat and no issues on resting conditions. He also reported dry cough since COVID shot but did not have any of such issues after the 1st dose. No fever, no dizziness or passing out. Diagnosis: Dilated cardiomyopathy (I42.0) -Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 25-30. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was diagnosed with cardiac amyloidosis. His weight had increased from 217 lbs to 227 lbs - reported shob but no edema, they discussed increasing furosemide (LASIX) to 40/d from 20 daily for a week and reassess. Also suspect COVID vaccine related immune phenomenon. Treatment received for the events (Dilated cardiomyopathy, Left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac amyloidosis and weight gain). Events (has increased on fatigue, cannot take breath well occasionally on exertion, abdominal swelling, weight gain and dry cough since COVID shot) onset date was on unspecified date in 2021. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported cardiac amyloidosis, Dilated cardiomyopathy, and the administration of the COVID19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the reasonable temporal association and lacking alternative explanations. More information on the patient&#39;s medical history, underlying medical conditions would be helpful for the Company to make a more meaningful causality assessment.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.
