                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

                                                Starting Monday March 1st approximately 25 hrs after my injection I started feeling slightly nauseous , and had a loose stool, diarrhea, The following morning I had 2 of the same bowel movements. That continued for a week, until March 9. I would only go in the morning, not all day. The nausea went away after the first day. On Thursday of the week, I took a 1/2 pill of Imodium, On Friday I took another half pill, On the Saturday I took a whole pill. On the Sunday I took 1 pill in the morning and one in early evening. I called my Doctor on Monday March 8th to discuss, he suggested I continue taking Imodium, no more than 2 a day for the next 3-4 days, and to call if I was still experiencing the diarrhea after then. I took 2 pills on the Tuesday, then Wednesday I didn&#39;t have a bowel movement , and finall on the Wednesday March 10th I was back to normal... I am not sure if this was caused by vaccine or not, but felt like I should report it.

                                                Acute appendicitis; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable physician (patient). A 60-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Dec2020 (at the age of 60-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Dec2020, the patient experienced acute appendicitis which resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had appendectomy as treatment. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks, no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event appendicitis is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Originally went to ER, they diagnosed it as torticollis.  They sent me to my PCP who confirmed it.  I had violent &amp; severe neck pain and severe headaches. Also an extremely stiff neck where I couldn?t turn it 1/8th oh an inch to either side.  It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

                                                This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Blood pressure high, Cancer (Two or less years ago; In remission, Taking medication to follow through with remission period), Allergies and sinus issues, covid virus (in July). The patient reported soreness in the arm (15Jan2021), fatigue (15Jan2021) and  palpitations (16Jan2021) that he felt below the mouth and above the heart, calling it the esophagus area. He wanted to know if others had reported this same palpitation. The reporter further reported that he has a little bit of concern. He felt fine, had sore arm and fatigue that has gone away. Noticed lately, somewhere in his esophagus between his heart and mouth that he is feeling palpitations. Doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s more indigestion. Stated it could be gas. Sometimes comes and goes, feels different than what he&#39;s already experienced. Wanted to double check if this has been heard of or anything similar to it. Clarified product as first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Received last Thursday. Received COVID-19 Vaccine in left arm on 14Jan2021 between 15:00 and 16:00. Both arms are sore, but only because other arm is injured. Pain level in injection arm was around 5-6 and he wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side. Within the second day, 16Jan2021 in late afternoon soreness and fatigue was gone. Indigestion or Palpitations, feeling was happening again. They wanted to know if that is something he is experiencing from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Stated it doesn&#39;t appear to be related. It is around the esophagus. Stated it affects breathing. Stated maybe that has something to do with it. For the dose, they noticed it was a small amount of fluid in the tube that was injected into him. The outcome of the events soreness in the arm/sore arm and fatigue was recovered on 16Jan2021, while for other events was unknown. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

                                                significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain; significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain; significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain; weakness; Nausea; mild myalgia; general muscle pain and aches; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine. He took some Aleve which gave some relief (for significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain). He asked if this is an expected side effect as it seem out of proportion to him. Outcome of events general muscle pain and aches and weakness was recovered on 30Jan2021. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 29Jan2021. Outcome of events significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain was recovering. The reporting physician (patient) assessed the causality between the suspect vaccine and all events as related. He assessed the events &#34;swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain&#34; as medically significant (serious), while he assessed the other events as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association and known product safety profile of  bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), the contributory role of the product cannot be totally excluded.

                                                Tinnitus in left ear.  Soft high-frequency crickets when my throat gets stressed, including hiccups, burping, stretching, sometimes yawning, muscle tensing, sometimes swallowing, stretching to wake up in the morning.  Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

On the second day I started having problems with my vision in my left eye, I went blind for 20minutes. When I did get my Vision back I got and slight headache.  About 3am in the morning, I woke up like someone hit me in the head with a hammer. After that every second or third day the pain would come back and it would be worse, it brought tears to my eyes. I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I&#39;m not having them as much. I&#39;m calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.

A 62-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EH9899, intramuscular in the left arm, on 08Jan2021 16:30 at 0.3 mL, single for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included ongoing high blood pressure and spinal surgery in Jan2019. Patient&#39;s eyesight was not the greatest. Patient previously received flu vaccine on an unspecified date (the last couple of years). Concomitant medication included amlodipine besilate for blood pressure. He was scheduled to get second dose on 29Jan2021. The Saturday before he was scheduled to get the second dose (23Jan2021), he started feeling sniffles and stuff. He went to urgent care and he was tested for covid and the test came back negative. He then kept feeling bad. He clarified that on 24Jan2021, he had headache and nausea. He had chills and he was beated down with sweat; body aches which are constant and he  would try to blame it on the position he was laying in while on the couch and it was not that; and does not have an appetite on an unspecified day in Jan2021. He has been in really bad shape for the last 9 or 10 days. When he went to go get his second shot, they would not give it to him due to his symptoms that he was experiencing since she had a fever at 100.4 the night before (28Jan2021). They scheduled him to get his second dose the following which was this Friday. He was asking if his side effects are totally normal. He cannot even sleep, reported that he will sleep an hour and then up for two or three hours. It really has him, and he feels miserable. The outcome of events Chills, nausea and fever at 100.4 was not recovered. Outcome of sniffles was recovered in Jan 2021 while the outcome of the remaining events was unknown. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of sniffles; he went to urgent care and they gave him something like zyrtec, states it was an allergy medication and it wiped out the sniffles for fever, he will take Tylenol and it will break the fever for a few hours and then his fever comes right back.  Follow-up attempts are completed. The information on the batch/lot number has been obtained.

I drank plenty of fluids after this, slept OK, and ate well in the morning. So it was a short, but significant event. No noticeable fever or other symptoms.

He refused to seek medical evaluation despite her urging.

It was like his head clogged up, his chest got heavy, almost like he had the flu, and now the left side of his head, he can&#39;t hear nothing out of it, it&#39;s just ringing.

Caller said that this is killing him.  He said that his head is still plugged, his chest feels like there are 10 people sitting on it, and he can&#39;t hear out of the left side and the  left side is still ringing and is like he had his bell rung playing football or something. The patient can&#39;t hear nothing out of it, it&#39;s just ringing. The patient rolled over on his right ear, power must have gone off because he couldn&#39;t hear the fan anymore, then rolled over on other ear and power must have come back on because he could hear it. The ringing didn&#39;t start until last night when he was sleeping. Stated he woke up and his ear was ringing.

                                                Morning after  Could not go to work  And I have worked 30 years without one sick day. Low grade fever in am with shaking but not cold. Started around 6 AM by 9 AM couldn&#39;t stand  very weak  slightly lightheaded    Threw up till almost choking.  At noon my temp hit  103.7   Took tylenol all AM and wasn&#39;t lowering temp.  That was the highest temp  Then gradually began to  come down   At 5:00 PM temp at 100 and able to put soup down.  Woke up  4 AM next day in  total sweat that had to move to other side of bed  Soaked but felt OK   On 23rd  Got headache above right eye to side of frontal lobe,   Not any strong headache at all   Dull  Like a 2 out of 10.  My concern is I still have the exact same headache as I did three weeks ago  Not a smidgen lower at all  SAME.  And I booked second vaccine for Sat 2/27th    I am concerned as I have heard second can be worse.   I have never had the flu and this was my first ever vaccine of any kind    Please advise

                                                I started to develop a headache and became a little nauseous right after. After two days, my fingers started swelling and hurting. I couldn&#39;t make a fist. It caused my immune system to go crazy. That lasted about 5 days. After taking Aleve and Tylenol, it helped reduce the pain. My kidney doctor told me to stop taking Aleve because it was interacting with my BP meds. The doctor from Northwest Arthritis prescribed Tramadol to help with pain. I still have pain, but it&#39;s tolerable.

                                                I fully understand that this is outside the side effect window.  However, on Sunday, March 14 I started to experience a fever (100.4), fairly significant fatigue,, tireness, loss of appetite and a slight headache.  The reason I am writing is that in addition to getting the vaccine, at which time I was triple-masked, I only left my home one other time to drop off mail at a post office (again, triple masked).  Neither myself nor my wife (the only other person I live with) left the house (other than she left once to pick up our grocery order, outside).  On Sunday, after the symptoms started, I went to a local clinic and took a PCR Covid test.  The results came back negative six hours later.  The symptoms lessened on Monday (the fever ranging from 99.4-100.4----my usual body temp is 97.6) and by Monday night the fever was gone.  By Tuesday morning not only was the fever gone, but so also were all the symptoms.  Again, I know this is outside the usual timeframe for side effects, other than maybe a skin rash, but I wanted to let you know because I think it is unlikely I contracted another virus because I go virtually nowhere, and am tripled masked whenever I go anywhere.

                                                About 21 hrs after shot I experienced significant dizziness and almost fainted. I have continued to experience slight dizziness from time to time but only severe when lying down, rolling over while lying down, looking straight up, and sometimes bending over.  5 days after shot I decided to check blood presure and it was repeatedly around 175/100. I went to local doctor and he prescribed additional BP meds. BP now good (126/80) but I still experience dizziness from time to time. Yesterday when BP high I also had constant headache and some nausea. Today(3/12), almost week after shot I still experience dizziness to a minor degree off and on, but still somewhat severe when lying down, looking up, and bending over

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

                                                Slight soreness in left arm around and just below the point of injection.  This went away around 6PM on Tuesday, the day after the injection.  For about 2 hours around 10PM until I went to sleep on Monday night (the night of the injection), I had a slight fever but it was only slight.  I had a more intense fever (though for only 30 minutes) the evening that I had my flu shot last October when I visited my doctor for a check up, so I would definitely categorize the fever from the COVID-19 shot as very slight.  It was gone when I woke up in the morning.  After I woke up, I was a bit nauseous, but it was so slight (and I have not been nauseous for well over a year) that it took me awhile to actually recognize it as being nauseous.  This lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared.  On Wednesday morning, my heart went into an irregular heartbeat that felt different than what I feel when it goes into an irregular heartbeat.  I have no idea if there is any relation between receiving the vaccine and getting an irregular heartbeat but I thought I should report it.  I have recovered from all symptoms from the vaccination except the irregular heartbeat.  I put down as &#34;unknown&#34; if I have recovered  from the adverse events as I don&#39;t know if going into an irregular heartbeat was in any way related to the vaccination.

                                                Oral thrush with plaques in the back of throat and uvula. Difficult/painful swallowing. I have been treating myself empirically with Mylanta, Rolaids, gargling salty water alternating with diluted listerine, honey, and basically a soft diet. I experienced headaches, general fatigue, and diarrhea as well, no fever, cough,not even pain or swelling at site of injection. I must said that I am feeling better, but still have soreness when swallowing, and I have lost 4 lbs. I do not know if this is a common side effect,so I decided to report it, I am on Humira due to my AS.

This 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 probably around noon (at age of 65 years old; lot number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed about 10 years ago and diabetes type 2 diagnosed about 10 years ago (as of 24Mar2021). He caught COVID a few months ago (as of 24Mar2021) and was sick for 3 weeks and then came out of that and at that time got a rash and came out of that and wanted to get the vaccine because he was age 65 and did not want this thing to kill him. Concomitant medication(s) included gabapentin 300mg, 1 capsule three times per day by mouth, taken for neuropathy in his hands and his hands hurt from 22Mar2021 and ongoing. He was given the gabapentin to stop his hands from hurting. He also had medications he took every day and had diabetes type 2, and also had high blood pressure that he took medication for. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Pfizer vaccine. The patient reported he saw his healthcare professional (HCP) for the first time the same day he got the Pfizer Vaccine on 22Mar2021 and saw the HCP that morning. When he left he felt fine that day 22Mar2021 and felt fine that night. That night he tore up his bedroom and cleaned it and felt fine. Then the next morning (23Mar2021) he went to work and felt fine for a while and then got to building. He started working and then felt like he was in slow motion and couldn&#39;t think and it was crazy and his mind was blank and he could not think and felt like he was in slow motion; couldn&#39;t think to do anything. The feeling like he was in slow motion and not being able to think began yesterday morning on 23Mar2021 and stopped yesterday 23Mar2021 also. Yesterday he came home because he runs saws at work and stuff like that and he couldn&#39;t think and couldn&#39;t be around stuff like that because he was cutting things and could get hurt. He had not had this happen before and the feeling as if he couldn&#39;t think and felt in slow motion was not ongoing today, 24Mar2021. Today he now has nausea and the nausea was ongoing and about the same as when it began. Also stated as today (24Mar2021) he felt kind of nauseated and couldn&#39;t do anything again today and thought he would stay home because of these small side effects of the vaccine that he wanted to report. He had no treatment for the reported events but just went home and laid down. The events did not require an emergency room visit. Regarding whether the events required a visit to physician office the patient replied &#34;Yes&#34;, he saw his HCP the morning of the day he got the vaccine on 22Mar2021. Patient was going to call the HCP to see if the medication she gave him would have these side effects and he had not taken the Gabapentin before; stated the HCP issued him Gabapentin that he began taking on 22Mar2021. He was calling the HCP to see if the reported events were related to the gabapentin as he had not taken that before. &#34;Feeling like he was in slow motion and not being able to think&#34; was recovered on 23Mar2021 and patient had not recovered from nauseated.

Covid was not tested post vaccination. The outcome of events was not recovered.  His colleague now knows he should have waited 90 days after the antibody but reporter was wondering if there was information. Since there probably is no information, this is a unique situation and reporter wondered if Pfizer wants him to run any particular tests or send in some blood to Pfizer for testing to further medical knowledge on giving the vaccine within 90 days of the antibodies.

I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

                                                My husband has had a fever and extreme exhaustion every day, all day. for 16 days, since he go the Pfizer vaccine. He is retaining water, does not sleep at night, has heavy night sweats, and is emotionally spent. He has no appetite and forces himself to eat. He tastes what little food he eats. He visited his family doctor, a gastroenterologist, and has been in the emergency room two times for sheer exhaustion and pain. He was released both times after tests. Each time, no one could find a cause and no one sent him to other doctors for help. They would not admit him because there was no guarantee he could see other doctors any faster than if he were at home making appointments. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist by the gastroenterologist, but that appointment  isn&#39;t until March 9, 2021. He will have faded even more by then.

The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

A 67-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EN6200 , on 17Feb2021 at single dose in arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ELI283) on 27Jan2021 and had no adverse effect. The patient was wondering if he hold the current record for the number of days consecutive for a person to have adverse reaction to the second vaccine because it was over a week and he could not move out of his bed. That almost killed him. His vision was also blurred. His weight was dropping rather rapidly because he was not able to eat. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.

Condition is not severe enough at this point to inhibit any activities, but is still present.

Some shortness of breath.  Patient saw me a few days later feeling like he was dying.  He was treated with steroids and vitamin C along with glutathione IV treatment.  Started to feel better the next day.  A week later, felt nearly back to normal.

                                                Extreme diarhea, gas, and lower back pain beginning about 10:30 PM the day after receiving  the vaccine injection. The pain is centered in the area of the surgeries (L3- L5) There was no discomfort at the injection site after the injection. There was no significant physical activity or strain, and no extraordinary dietary changes prior to the reactions. the injection may not be the cause of pain and diarhea, but some of the possible reactions include &#34;..muscle pain.. and feeling unwell&#34;. My primary concerns are: 1) Will the back pain subside?  It is less now, and I hope it will return to normal in time.  2) Should I take any additional injections of the vaccine?

                                                12 hours following the injection I developed a severe anaphylactic reaction including extreme swelling of lips, tongue, soft palate; difficulty breathing when reclined; difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking coherently. My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                Not sure if delayed reaction because it was a week out.  Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

                                                Patient was in to receive his second dose of the COVID vaccine. He reported no known issues after his first dose and remained in the pharmacy for the recommended 15 minute observation period following the vaccine without any problems. He reported to us today that around 45 minutes after having received the vaccine, he started to have a choking episode, something that he commonly experiences with his Parkinson&#39;s Disease, so he and his wife didn&#39;t think much of it. This seemed to evolve into nausea and dry heaves with excess mucus production that lasted for hours. Because of the duration, they decided to contact his insurance company&#39;s nurse line who recommended he go to the Emergency Department to rule out COVID and pneumonia  He was admitted to the ED and ultimately found to be negative for both COVID and pneumonia, at which point they decided that his Parkinson&#39;s exacerbation might have been the result of having received the vaccine. He has since been discharged and is doing well.

                                                Headache, feverish, chills, sick feeling with fatigue.  Slept much of day.  Didn&#39;t feel like doing anything.  Loss of appetite. Feeling of unease in my stomach.  Was nauseous right before bedtime.  Next day (on the 27th) I felt much better in the morning.  Didn&#39;t have the sick feeling.  Didn&#39;t seem to have the headache.  Had some appetite again.  So, I had a really bad day the day after the vaccination.

I measured my BP and O2; BP = 119/77, HR = 80; O2 = 98%, HR =77. I also felt nauseous and only had a piece bread with butter. I took a Nautamine tablet and slept for about 2 hrs, until 10:30. Things were better, I could move around and back to normal by 2 pm.

A 69-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; solution for injection, Lot Number: EN6201), via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm at the age of 69 years, on 18Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known for a history of heart disease, stage 4 kidney failure and polycystic disease. He had been bleeding from the kidneys for a week prior to receiving the vaccine, heart attack and cholesterol. He stated he needs some reassurance and added he has Stage 4 kidney failure with polycystic disease. He already consulted with his heart doctor and kidney doctor and they say get the vaccine. He mentioned that every now and then he gets blood from a cyst rupture. On the day of the first shot he was having a little bit of bleeding in his urine. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

                                                Vertigo -- intermittent, associated with head movement. Suddenly turning or changing the orientation of my head results in vertigo for several seconds. I experienced nausea for a few minutes after getting out of bed this morning.  I developed the same symptoms (but much milder) 8 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on Dec. 23 (the morning of Dec. 31). Those symptoms mostly occurred when I went from supine or prone to any other position (eg, rolling over). They resolved after about 1 week. I did not report those symptoms because I didn&#39;t associate them with the vaccine. That vaccine was Lot # EH9899.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                About twelve hours after shot (10pm) began to feel uncomfortable. By 10:30pm was shivering with temperature of 101 fahrenheit, headache, sinus congestion with clear liquid running out of nose and nausea. Took two acetaminophen at 11:00 pm. About two hours later, nose stopped running and just had nasal drip. Could not sleep. At 3:30 am  (Tuesday morning) nausea subsided. At 10:00 a,m Tuesday still in bed but felt better. Checked temperature and still 101. Continued to take acetaminophen every six hours as recommended. Checked temperature  in the afternnon and it was 99. Checked temperature again at 9:00 pm before going to bed  and it was exactly 98.6.  Decided not to take more acetaminophen. Got up around 3:00 am (Wednesday morning) to use restroom and  checked temperature. It was 100.2. Took two acetaminophen and went to bed. That was the last time I registered an elevated temperature. Still feel weak and tired six days later.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Patient was admitted to the facility on 3/12/2021 and transferred out to a hospital on 3/15/2021. Patient died on 3/24/2021 due to acute respiratory failure at a medical center. This report is being written because patient received Pfizer covid19 vaccine, Facility requires we report to VAERS if death occurs within 42 days of vaccination. Prior to his hospital admission, his previous one was 5/11/2020-5/14/2020. Please see below for hospital course at the Facility: 70 yo male with PMHx of COPD, CHFrEF 20%, CAD s/p MI and CABG in 1999, HLD, HTN, DM2, GERD, Anxiety and Depression who presented with increased shortness of breath to facility. Transfered on 3/13 to the facility. Noted increased SOB without CP, palpitations, cough, orthopnea or PND. No history of home O2 use but required 2-3L O2 during this hospital stay. Was noted on admit to Facility to have troponin elevation with unchanged EKG. Was started on NSTEMI protocol with heparin ggt, ASA, BB, and statin. Initially received one dose ceftriaxone/azithro for possible PNA. On admission, primary team held home BB. On arrival to Facility, troponin at 3.998 trended to 4.442 and then trended down. underwent CTA to evaluate for PE that was negative. CXR and CT showed pulmonary edema consistent with HF exacerbation and a proBNP 8613. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix x2. RRT was called twice, once for BP 80/50 treated with 500ml IVF, and second for CP that resolved with NTG and tramadol. Cardiology was consulted with goal to cath patient, however some concern for medication adherence going forward so they will reevaluate. Patient began to have tachycardia with rates in the 150s sustained and hypotension. EKG showed likely sinus tachycardia with wide QRS similar to prior EKGs. Patient has ICD in place that was interrogated and showed good function. IV metoprolol 5mg given x3 with rated decrease to upper 120s. Patient remained asymptomatic, awake, and alert. Per discussion with wife after transfer, patient BP has been in the 50s systolic at home for the last month. Cardiac cath was performed showing 99% stenosis of LCX. Did not tolerate procedure with nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. RRT was called after cath procedure. He is nauseous, diaphoretic. He complained of chest pressure. STAT EKG obtained. Noted ST depressions in the septal leads significant from before. Cardiology concerned pt was having an inferior MI. STEMI call was activated and hospital cath lab was called and report given to the cardiologist on call. Pt was then transported to the Facility and he passed away on 3/24/2021.

Presented to Hospital on 4/7 complaining of shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting  with elevated troponin and NSTEMI. Low suspicion that the vaccine caused this man?s heart attack as his hear cath showed severe multi-vessel disease. Pt gave inconsistent history in previous COVID infection: he told some he did have it and others that he did not .    CT surgery was consulted, and patient was not felt to have viable targets for CABG.  Cardiology discussed risks and benefits of an attempt at a high risk PCI to the LAD, and patient and family opted for medical management. Patiet discharge home on 4/10/21 with medical management for his coronary artery disease and new onset systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 15%, including aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, Coreg, furosemide, Entresto.

Past drug history included amlodipine, ibuprofen, lisinopril with reaction allergies, metformin with contraindication to patient on dialysis, not a true allergy and patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient experienced COVID-19 test was positive, COVID pneumonia, slight delirium, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, tachypnea, abdominal pain on an unknown date, hypoxic on 14Apr2021, myalgia and achy in Apr2021. It was reported that patient in her hemodialysis unit who were vaccinated with BNT162b2 but were recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient COVID results were sent to the local health department for genetic sequencing (pending) and SARS titers were drawn (pending). He presented to HD unit with SOB on 05Apr2021 and routine COVID-19 test was positive. He was hospitalized for COVID pneumonia and put on high flow oxygen, he was still in hospital. He came in for dialysis on 05Apr2021 and was very short of breath. Patient reported that the night before they felt myalgia and achy. No fever. Sent straight to the ER from the dialysis unit to check fluid levels and was admitted. He was tested for Covid and was found positive. His oxygen saturation was at 90.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included liver cancer and chemo. There were no concomitant medications. It was reported that for two times, the patient woke up in the morning delirious, did not know where he was, hollering for his wife, couldn&#39;t get up, got sick and vomited, after he got up he felt pretty good. States he fell asleep on couch that night, toward morning he rolled onto floor, flopping around on floor like a wet seal, flopping arms around tried to roll over, pulled muscle in rib cage, after he got back up, got sick and had to vomit. Once he got up and went to the bathroom and all of that went away, wanted to know if this is this related to the Covid vaccine. This morning (unspecified date) he laid on the couch and he was about half scared to lay down because he was afraid something would happen again. The patient confirmed that he experienced this twice the day after or a couple days after the vaccine (unknown date). The patient stated that it has not happened again. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                About 8 hours after injection, I began having pain on right side of back just under ribs. Pain worsened through night, causing difficult sleep. On evening of second day, pain spread to right flank and right front of abdomen, causing entire right side of abdomen to experience significant pain. It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the &#34;muscle aches&#34; described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor. I am taking Tylenol and applying Voltarin topically, but neither helps much.

A 71-years-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), lot EL3246 , unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:10 (at the age of 71-years old) as a SINGLE DOSE given in left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing vertigo, ongoing dizziness, ongoing balance problems, ongoing vision problems, ongoing stomach problems, he lost 80lbs in a year, but his weight is starting to go back up. He has had bad health for the last 3 years. He goes to the doctors all the time. In fact, he just went to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) to find out what was going on. He has had dizziness quite often, so there are days where he just don&#39;t feel good but, he thinks it has something to do with his eyes. When he feels bad, he will lay down and close his eyes, and all of his problems go away. He went to see a retina specialist because of his continuing vision problems. The ENT doctor told him he can&#39;t help him. Concomitant medications included 6 different medications.  The patient experienced side effects after getting the first dose of the vaccine. He got the first dose a week ago and he said that he experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills and diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills in Jan2021 and diarrhea on 26Jan2021. He had his shot a week ago tomorrow. He was up all night last night with diarrhea, he was up probably up 10 times. He was supposed to go in to get his teeth pulled today, but he just can&#39;t do it. He does have some chills and nausea. He is feeling unwell. He supposed that he is dehydrated in Jan2021. The diarrhea just started last night, 26Jan2021. He got up about 6:15 this morning and that was the last time he had diarrhea. He still has nausea, but he hasn&#39;t had any other diarrhea. He has some nausea from the time to time. He doesn&#39;t have any COVID symptoms that he can tell. He is feeling unwell, and has the nausea and chills, but he does not have any fever. He hasn&#39;t had a fever and he can still smell and taste and all of that stuff. One thing he did notice after he got his COVID-19 shot was that he did not have any symptoms of any kind. He never had pain in his arm, nothing. He received the vaccine on 21Jan2021, and he never felt a thing or anything that would associate with the shot. The consumer doesn&#39;t know if what he is going through is caused by the shot or not. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Anxiety; tiredness; headache; chills; nausea; feeling unwell; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable healthcare professional (patient). A 71-year-old male patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231) solution for injection, intramuscular on right arm on 26Jan2021 at 10:30 AM at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic back pain. The patient has no allergies to medications, food, or other products. Concomitant medications included unspecified blood pressure and pain medications which he received within 2 weeks of vaccination.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

                                                A week after my second dose for Covid 19 I started have diarrhea and it continued for days and I still have it. I am concerned because it won&#39;t stop. I am drinking lots of fluids so as not to dehydrate. I will call my Doctor if it does not stop after 7 days. I hope this is a minor side effect of a good vaccine.  Thanks

                                                Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus; Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; COVID-19 confirmed by positive COVID-19 test / COVID pneumonia; blood clot; blood pressure was low; Respiratory arrest; Respiratory failure; Hypoxemia; ventricular tachycardia; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse reporting on behalf of the husband. A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

After receiving the vaccine the patient went to the recovery area for the required 15 minutes. About 10 minutes later his breathing rapidly increased - eventually turning to large gasps of air. The patient then briefly passed out but then quickly woke up. He then started vomiting for the next 10 minutes. Eventually he recovered enough to walk with the help of his wife. The wife stated that he has had episodes like this from other vaccines and blood draws. He has never vomited from the episodes, however.

                                                Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine first of two shots given 2021 03 16 Tue 15:00. No immediate reaction. Ate supper fine. Went to bed 22:30 that night. Awakened suddenly at 23:30, 8.5 hours after shot, by vomitus arising in throat, only just had time to lean over and vomit into wastebasket. A few dry heaves followed, and cough, possibly due to some vomit hitting my windpipe. Did not feel nauseous before, during, or after, though stomach remained a little quivery for a couple of hours. This could have been fatal if I had not woken up: I could have chocked to death on the vomit.

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100.; The next day after patient got the first dose of the covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter has memories of that, and reporter does not want that to happen again. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue: Patient did not go to church on Sunday. Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness. Reporter knew then that she had to get patient to drink water. Reporter thought that patient might be dehydrated. Patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100: A-Fib started the morning of 26Mar2021. It was resolved completely by the same evening, about supper time. After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office. Patients heart rate continued to be erratic until supper time, but it was not bad. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient had low blood pressure: Reporter checks patients blood pressure in the mornings. Patients blood pressure is now back to normal. Patients low blood pressure has resolved. It continued a bit on Saturday, 27Mar2021. It resolved on Saturday evening. Reporter is still having patient push fluids. Patient is still currently drinking a lot of fluids with electrolytes. AE(s) did not require a visit to Emergency Room/Physician Office. Outcome of the event atrial fibrillation, heart rate increased, Dizziness, diarrhoea was recovered on 26Mar2021, blood pressure decreased, fatigue was recovered on 27Mar2021, other events was unknown.

It was informed that patient had vaccination on right arm because he had a dialysis fistula in his left arm. Relevant medical history included also ongoing End stage renal disease, dialysis on 13Apr2021. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP6955) and experienced arm pain and headache. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 11Apr2021 the patient experienced shivering and quaking and chills, nauseous and vomiting, panic attack, &#39;was freaking out&#39;, soft pain in left side of chest, fast pulse , all provided as non serious. On the same day 11Apr2021 the patient also experienced difficulty breathing, low oxygen blood level,  potassium level increased and extra fluid in his body which led to the emergency room and admission to the hospital. Clinical course was described as follows: everything was going good until Sunday at 3:29 am. Her husband woke up shivering, quaking, and he was freaking out repeating oh my god, so she called emergency number.  When her husband found out that she couldn&#39;t get into the ambulance with her husband and ride to the hospital, so her husband refused to go to the hospital. She states that her husband also felt nauseous and vomited in this period of time. She stated that he had no fever, though. So fast forward to 8:30 am her husband was having difficulty breathing, and she called again and this time they had 7 paramedics come out to the house. She states that all of them were very nice. An EKG was performed because patient reported that he had a soft pain in his left side of his chest. She states that everything was cool with that, except his pulse rate was high. She states that he also had low blood oxygen level. She states that they strapped in her husband in and drove him to the hospital to the ER. At the ER they discovered that potassium level increased and she said that he had some extra fluid in his body. He was a dialyses patient so they gave him dialysis on Sunday evening. He had calmed down at that point and they were constantly taking blood from him. She found out about the COVID vaccine had potassium and phosphate as active ingredients and her husband shouldn&#39;t have that. She also informed that they had to give him a tranquilizer because he was having a panic attack during this whole episode. She says that they gave him alprazolam. Patient doesn&#39;t know exactly when the side effects went away because he didn&#39;t have a clock or a phone. Patient&#39;s wife also clarified that he vomited twice before going to the hospital but then he felt like he had to vomit afterwards but he did not. She stated that his breathing problems didn&#39;t stop when paramedics came and gave him oxygen. They made it to their house by 8:40 am, and he still had low oxygen level, they were still giving oxygen the whole time he was in the hospital. The patient was discharged on 13Apr2021. At the time of the reporting event outcome was unknown.

This consumer reported for a 72-year-old male patient (husband) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EL3247), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 08:00 at single dose on left arm for COVID-19 prevention. The medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got the shot on 19Jan2021. Since Jan2021, his arm was still sore, but he had been nauseated since then. He has no energy. He has had it almost four days. He was fine until he got it and his arm is sore and he is nauseated. He is usually on the go. The patient also has an inflamed liver. He has been sick since. The patient has no appetite, he is sweating, his bones are hurting, and he is tired. The consumer took her husband to his doctor, and they tested him for COVID, and it came back negative, but the consumer does not think the PA did the test right. The consumer doesn&#39;t know what to do with him, because he is still tired, and has no appetite. The patient is breaking out in cold chills, and his bones are still sore. When the patient got the vaccine, he was walking and talking, and by 11 AM that day, he was in bed. The patient had some labs done, and was being told that his liver is big, so the consumer did not know if the vaccine went to his liver. The outcome of the events was unknown.

Each attack lasted 15 to 25 minutes, and seemed to be alleviated by taking anti-acid (simethicone) pills. Quite likely related the vaccine: 11 days after the vaccine was administered, I experienced a rather severe headache, plus slight general weakness, and a raised temperature of between 98.9 and 100.4 degrees. The first 10 days I had discerned no adverse effects. This has lasted16 hours so far, with little alleviation.

                                                terrible terrible stomach pain; bug in his colon; white blood cell 18000/19500; his blood pressure was out of the roof; could not eat anymore; he&#39;s lost 10 pounds; dehydrated; vomiting 5 times; nausea; feeling warm; broke out in sweats; arm was sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). This consumer reported similar event for 3 patients (for herself, her husband and their doctor). This is 1st of three reports (husband case) and only this case is serious. A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 25Feb2021 16:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included diabetes mellitus and blood pressure abnormal; both from 2007 and ongoing; about 13-14 years, he does not take insulin, he takes oral medication. The consumer is calling for her husband who is in the hospital. His symptoms started after Covid 19 injection. He suddenly, out of nowhere, got a terrible, terrible pain in the middle of his stomach, it doubles him over, and he broke out in sweats and this was Saturday, 27Feb2021, in the morning. The sweating went away but the pain continued and continued. He went to urgent care on 27Feb2021 they thought he was constipated and was treated for constipation. The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

                                                First dose received 01/22/2021 and second dose on above date (02/11/2021) These events may have no relation to the vaccination but due to their concomitance, I eventually felt it might be best to report them. Three days following the first dose, I started to experience hematuria as well as constipation. It has happened before as a result of radiation treatment back in 2005/2006. Saw my urologist on 02/02/2021, and  had several tests, ruling out any return of cancer. Antibiotics improved the situation, which was getting closer to normal prior to getting the second dose. Again, three days following the second dose, hematuria returned and still prevails at various degrees. Also experience fatigue and weight loss.

The first couple of days on 27Jan2021, they had a little bit of a headache. The third day (29Jan2021), they started having constipation and bloating which was not normal for them. He has taken enough stuff which should have cleared it out. They were having a lot of gas and were very bloated. They are asking if anyone else has reported this since it is unusual for them. His wife comes on the line at times to provide details throughout the call. For treatment, patient reported that he took Tylenol with aspirin, took a sinus pill called Mucinex, to make sure it was not his sinuses. Patient took a lot of stuff for the constipation.

                                                Swelling, soreness at injection site just after shot. Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

                                                Patient received his first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine.  Patient was screened and given vaccine with no incident.  Patient was waiting in observation area for 30 mins post the vaccine.  About 10 mins post vaccination patient felt sick to his stomach and spit up into his mask.  He called pharmacy staff over and we gave garbage pale to spit up into.  He spit up approximately 10ml of orange phlegm and that was all.  He asked for water to rinse his mouth so staff gave him a little bit of water to rinse with.  Pharmacist stayed with patient and monitored him for additional adverse effects.  Pharmacist took patient&#39;s blood pressure which was 174/98 at 3:21pm 14 mins post vaccination and a second time 19mins post vaccination at 3:26pm it was 150/90.  Patient reported having history of acid reflux and he had just had orange juice and Jax (cheetos) so he believed it was due to what he ate.  We continued to monitor patient.  He stated he was feeling fine and wanted to leave.  Pharmacist asked to recheck his BP at which he declined saying he was feeling fine and the 150/90 is normal for him.  The pharmacist help to escort the patient to the front registers to make sure he was not experiencing anything else and at that time patient stated he felt fine and was leaving the store.

A 73-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number EN6204), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 04Mar2021 11:15 (at the age of 73-years-old), at 0.3 mL (30 mcg), single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included: service connected disability diagnosed from the (name withheld) for a lower back injury; last Spring and early Summer (2020) he went through treatment for 45 days with External beam radiation therapy (EBRT), which was 405 doses of radiation from a machine called FORD, had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer last year (2020);  had anaphylactic shock, rash, awful case of hives when in military service in response to shots then and stayed for half an hour until okay (The patient was unable to provide names of vaccines given in past in service since that was in 1969-1970&#39;s. At that time, they got the shots in big air guns and was shot 3-4 at a time. Had those 3-4 shots during his basic training. During that time, he woke up around midnight and had awful case of hives and was taken to the base hospital and was given adrenaline in one arm and diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) in the other); allergies to sulfa drugs; diagnosed allergies (unspecified); compromised immune status; respiratory illness; genetic/chromosomal abnormalities; endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes and obesity); blood stools, rare occasion; glasses. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient had no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination or on the same day as the vaccination. The patient received the first dose on 04Mar2021 at about 11:15. He had not had much of a reaction, just a little soreness and soreness (04Mar2021). The soreness started that afternoon of getting the vaccine. When he went to sleep, he noticed the soreness was in right arm, so he didn&#39;t lay on that side. He noticed it enough to sleep on the other side. On 07Mar2021, the patient had bloody stools, which were a rare occasion in the past. The patient stated the blood was significant enough to draw his attention, almost felt like a blockage in the system. The patient &#34;sat on the pot&#34; for 15-20 minutes and broke into a sweat (07Mar2021). The patient did not know if he had bloody stool then, because he didn&#39;t turn on the light, but ever since then, it has been bloody. No BM&#39;s (bowel movement) since yesterday (09Mar2021). The patient was tired yesterday (09Mar2021). He just laid around all day on a heating pad. He had a dull ache in stomach since it started (07Mar2021). Still there today, but not that bad. The patient stated he had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer, they tried to prevent burning or damaging the rectum, but this could be related to that. On Sunday night (07Mar2021), about midnight, he got an awful, awful stomach pain that woke him up about midnight. He tried to move his bowels 2-3 times Sunday night (07Mar2021) and on Monday morning (08Mar2021) he was able to move them a little bit. His underwear he had from Sunday night had lots of red stains in them, and all day Monday (08Mar2021) he was having a bellyache. Every time he managed to move his bowels and it was bloody and seemed to get bloodier pretty much all day. Yesterday (09Mar2021), he laid on a heating pad and went to bed early about 20:30, he usually goes about 22:00. He managed to stay in bed for about 9 hours, and he usually can&#39;t sleep that long. He slept on his side. He started having dark thoughts (unspecified date Mar2021), stating that last Spring and early Summer he went through treatment for 45 days with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). On Monday night (08Mar2021), the patient had terrible cramps about midnight, with very cold sweat and diarrhea. The next morning (09Mar2021), every bowel movement was very bloody. Then all day Tuesday (09Mar2021) very lethargic. No more bowel movements until the following Friday. The patient stated he felt like I was trying to pass a blood clot. The patient stated he seemed to have problems with bowels all day yesterday (09Mar2021) and was not much better; he had really low energy (09Mar2021). Today (10Mar2021), he seemed to feel better, but not much. He had not eaten much (Mar2021) and was hesitant to put food in his system, since his system was not functioning very well. The patient had not been seen by doctor or in an emergency room. His wife was a retired nurse, and they have discussed if he was not better, they were going to call his primary care provider and urologist. The patient had coffee this morning (10Mar2021), and he barely touched it yesterday morning. So far, no bloody discharge, no discharge or bowel movements today. Three to four times in the night he did pass gas (Mar2021), and that was all that happened. The patient knew side effects were rare with this (vaccine) and unsure if these side effects were something reported; this was certainly unusual for him. The clinical outcome of bloody stools, dull ache in stomach, had really low energy, terrible cramps, very cold sweat, diarrhea, tired, and lethargic was recovering. The outcome of belly ache, decreased appetite, and gas, was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

The consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really.

Immediately I had burning sensation on the upper jaw inside the mouth as if I had drank real hot drink. It felt like the skin on the upper jaw is going to peel off. Then I brushed my teeth and took my tablets. After swallowing I got burning sensation in my Stomach. Both feelings subsided after some time may be half hour.

Then less frequently (bigger intervals - maybe 4 times) till about 5am 3/6/21.  Then it more or less stopped.  Headache left, and though the stomach was worked over, I was now feeling better. Other than a rough night. All this time I had been rehydrating  frequently - trying to keep pace with discharge . . . (fizzy water - no additives) sometimes cut with a very little cranberry juice.  Since then  BRAT and now back to almost normal.   4lb lighter . . . That&#39;s good.

                                                My father complained of heartburn the evening he received his vaccine.  He told my mother he need to sit  down and relax.  My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

This 74-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered on the arm left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;maybe I don&#39;t know 6198, it&#39;s GN or EN&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, broken back, breathing problem because of his heart and lung, his lungs have problem, he had some nodules in it, and kidney stone once 25 years ago, 5 little stones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a reaction, it is the worst reaction he has ever had in his life, the pain he had, he was almost paralyzed and couldn&#39;t walk after vaccine and he had to get a wheelchair because he couldn&#39;t stand on his feet. He ended up in the emergency room. The vaccine put him out of work, and now he can work some. He is trying to make it up in two days, today and tomorrow to finish up. He was very upset and wanted to know why this happened to him. The patient stated that other people he talked to had no reaction, if they had a fever or anything it was gone in a coupled days, but he ended up in the emergency room. On 01Mar2021, patient had his first dose and at 02:30, he got out of the facility and came out okay with no problem. At 21:00, all of a sudden he saw that he could not stand up on his feet and he fell awake. He waited in the bed, people around him got worried. Eventually, he asked them to bring wheelchair, maybe he can drive. He drove home with his wife to the emergency from his house and he got admitted in emergency and he was screaming so bad, he did not believe in his life, he never heard somebody doing like this. He felt like somebody getting chills like somebody cutting his side, on his lower abdomen on the right side. It&#39;s underside of the lower abdomen, he had slight pain every single day, sometime excruciating, he took Ibuprofen for it. He thought he had a kidney stone because he had it once 25 years ago, 5 little stones, so they took him to emergency, took him to the CT scan. They didn&#39;t find anything, but the pain was excruciating and in the emergency room everybody thought the crazy man is here who is screaming. He couldn&#39;t control his scream. He couldn&#39;t walk, he couldn&#39;t move. Every movement was like you put a knife on the cutting, it was that bad. His second dose was due on 22Mar2021. He went to the pharmacy and asked them the number and let them know that he had a reaction like this and they called somebody and said to cancel the shot. They cancelled it. That day for 3 days, patient had the pain, it was slowly because he had to take eventually oxycodone. The doctor advised in the emergency room that nothing was wrong, just to slow down the pain but he was not allowed to take the oxycodone. He took the 10 mg oxycodone and the pain which was an hour and a half was a little bit down. After 3 hours, it was a little better, he didn&#39;t want to scream, it was gone but the pain was still there for at least 3 days, really bad. He was taking ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. He did all those things and still I have the pain left and he did not know what to do with that. The lab test he had, he had been okay, he did not have any problem. He got the result on 22Mar2021. Outcome of the events pain and abdominal pain was not recovered and of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He was initially reported to be thrombocytopenic with platelet down to 77 but with lots of clumping. Platelet manual count reveled platelet normal at 160, however it was done after patient received IVIG and prednisone. HIT serology came back strongly positive at 2.58 however equivocal (does not neutralize heparin), patient was then switched to Xarelto.

A 75-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number- UNKNOWN) on 18Feb2021 14:30 as single dose and was previously administered the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number-UNKNOWN) via an unspecified route of administration as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Patient was 75-years-old at the time of vaccination. Patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had his second dose and his first dose he had in his right shoulder he hardly felt the pain, he waited for an hour before leaving, he had no side effects at all, little soreness in shoulder, he had no complaint about it but he had the second vaccine at 2:30 afternoon (statement incomplete). Patient experienced little soreness in shoulder, was feeling so weak,  had waves of chills, shaking, he shook for about an hour, it went away for a while, in half an hour or 45 minutes it returned again. He never had shaking with chills in his entire life, he was surprised with the reaction, by 2:30 this afternoon after 24 hours of that he was back to hundred percent again, he was recovering very nicely but he does have injection site pain in shoulder but that&#39;s not a big deal. Patient visited hospital because he had severe chills accompanied with headache, feeling tired, some nausea, there was unwell feeling, little bit of fever was not actual fever but the injection site pain (reason of hospitalization was not clarified). The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021210764 similar report from same reporter
