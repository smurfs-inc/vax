                                                Patient was vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2 on 6-Jan-21 at his site of employment, a Nursing Home. Patient presented to Urgent Care on 15-Jan-21 complaining of left sided chest pain that started the evening before with an associated slight cough.  Pt was afebrile with a heart rate of 88 and an O2 sat on room air of 98% in triage.  His EKG showed a sinus tachycardia of 114 with a slightly prolonged QTc of 463 ms. Physical exam was significant for bibasilar crackles and X-ray showed bibasilar infiltrates consistent with COVID pneumonia but bacterial pneumonia could not be excluded. The patients BP was documented as 97/64.  He was treated with Zofran for nausea and tylenol. He was prescribed a five day course of Azithromycin, an Albuterol inhaler, guaifenessin with codeine cough syrup, and Zofran. Labs were drawn and he was discharged.  His lab results were reported after his departure and were significant for a white blood cell count of 1.33, platelet count of 73, 2% myelocytes, 1% metamyelocytes, an absolute neutrophil count of 0.75 K/ul, a creatinine of 1.83, total bilirubin of 1.3, with direct bilirubin of 0.8, alkaline phosphatase of 294 and AST of 112 with ALT noted to be within normal limit. His COVID nasopharyngeal swab from the visit was reported as negative and a swab performed at his employment on 13-Jan-21 was also reported to be negative.  Patient could not be reached by phone after discharge from Urgent Care about these labs. On the evening of 16-Jan-21, Police Department received a 911 call about an adult at the patient&#39;s address who was found unresponsive. Upon arrival on scene, the patient was found to be deceased and a decision was made not to attempt to resuscitate. The death was deemed to be non-suspicious and the patient&#39;s body was transported to a funeral home.  On 19-Jan-21, I contacted the State Medical Examiner&#39;s Office.  They have decided to perform an autopsy and have recovered the CBC and chemistry specimens obtained for further testing.

That continued for a week, until March 9. I would only go in the morning, not all day. The nausea went away after the first day. On Thursday of the week, I took a 1/2 pill of Imodium, On Friday I took another half pill, On the Saturday I took a whole pill. On the Sunday I took 1 pill in the morning and one in early evening. I called my Doctor on Monday March 8th to discuss, he suggested I continue taking Imodium, no more than 2 a day for the next 3-4 days, and to call if I was still experiencing the diarrhea after then. I took 2 pills on the Tuesday, then Wednesday I didn&#39;t have a bowel movement , and finall on the Wednesday March 10th I was back to normal... I am not sure if this was caused by vaccine or not, but felt like I should report it.

                                                Acute appendicitis; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable physician (patient). A 60-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 17Dec2020 (at the age of 60-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 22Dec2020, the patient experienced acute appendicitis which resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit, Emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient had appendectomy as treatment. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks, no Covid prior vaccination and was not Covid tested post vaccination. The outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event appendicitis is likely an intercurrent medical condition and unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

Low pulse ox (88) Fever (101-102F) and chills Related difficulty urinating and frequent urination due to prostate inflammation Loss of memory (Brain Fog?) in which I had no memory of events occurring from 3/7-3/9 and little memory on 3/10.  Memory was close to normal on 3/12.   Two Covid tests with negative results (taken on 3/8 and 3/11) Some lung congestion which could be due to bloody sinus mucus and post nasal drip I did retain my sense of smell and taste but had no appetite and did not eat or ate very minimally  from 3/7pm until 3/11pm Very fatigued and weak with knee, hip and general joint pain.  Increasing levels of fatigue started on 3/2 with little energy from 3/7-3/11.  Fatigue is mostly gone as of 3/23.

                                                I felt fine going in to get the vaccine, that evening my stomach hurt a little. And I do recall after the first dose I received back on 03-01-21 I had a little stomach issue but it was gone the next day. That evening I went to bed and I began to get the worst stomach cramps I will call them and sick to my stomach feeling I had ever experienced. I did not ever get a fever. I went to the ER the next morning and had my gallbladder and Pancreas as well as the liver scanned and checked. I was told that my blood work was good only  a small elevation in a part of the liver test. but it was nothing to worry about. I came hone where I laid vomiting, very lose stools, and unable to keep anything in for almost 6 days. I followed up with my regular dr and will follow up again at the end of this week. I was literally down for 6 days. My blood sugars were over the chart because I was unable to eat or drink. The cramping or pains were  awful. I am still sore in my stomach  but now beginning to eat and feel better.

                                                Originally went to ER, they diagnosed it as torticollis.  They sent me to my PCP who confirmed it.  I had violent &amp; severe neck pain and severe headaches. Also an extremely stiff neck where I couldn?t turn it 1/8th oh an inch to either side.  It all got so severe that I didn?t eat for days at a time and was literally not with it.  Couldn?t respond when spoken to, and became excessively weak where I couldn?t walk w/o help, and speech was slurred.  It all lasted 5 days where it was so severe.  With medication it slowly began to back off.

Took two doses of Benadryl and has now developed chest tightness and throat swelling. Per doctor&#39;s notes: Patient is a very pleasant 60-year-old gentleman who comes in for evaluation after a possible allergic reaction today, possibly related to a second dose of Pfizer Covid vaccine that he got at 8 AM this morning.  About an hour later he started to feel flushed.  He felt like his face was warm and his ears were warm.  He started to feel like the inside of his mouth had filled with a rubber ball.  His tongue felt full and he started noticed progressively that he felt like he was having difficulty swallowing.  States that he never actually had any lip swelling, contrary to the triage note, just felt funny in the interior of his mouth.  Did feel like his tongue was slightly swollen, both based on the fact that it felt &#34;thick&#34; when he was talking, and on direct inspection, as well.  Took 50 mg of Benadryl around the time that his symptoms started, and lay down to nap for a little while.  When he woke up he was still feeling like he was having more difficulty swallowing.  He also felt like his face was a little bit puffy, prickly under each eye.  He also felt like he had a blotchy rash on his chest and upper back, which his wife corroborates.  He felt like his chest was a little bit tight and that something was heavy on his chest, though he was not wheezing or acutely short of breath, per se.  Took another 50 mg of Benadryl at about 2:15 PM, and presented to the emergency department for further evaluation.  Currently still has a little bit of chest tightness and throat tightness.  He feels flushed.  Symptoms have not worsened, but they have not completely resolved, either.  He has had anaphylaxis in the past and has had to be admitted to the hospital.  And this was in relation to taking doxycycline, it sounds like. Patient presented again to the ED on 4/22/21 with the same symptoms. He was admitted with anaphylaxis. Per ED notes, also diagnosed with Angioedema, improved. Likely related to second covid vaccine. Cant rule out secondary to Lisinopril.

Went home and still felt dizzy and then I felt like I need to pee  but I was very cold ,  urinated 3 more times thinking it was because it was due to being cold but doctor explained it was due to me drinking lost of water.  Went to bathroom and bassed out and woke up about an hour later, but during the fall I injured the neck by heating your head on the sink, back and broke my nose, when I woke up  I was still very dizzy. Also felt a fast heart rate,  chest pain, very nauseas and started sweating a lot.

                                                High fever; Vomiting; Severe fatigue; Weakness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient himself).  This 61-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number EL1442), via intramuscular, on 05Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Age at vaccination was 61-year-old. Vaccine location was deltoid left. The subject did not have a relevant medical history and concomitant medications. On 06Jan2021, the patient developed high fever, vomiting, severe fatigue and weakness. He did not experience anaphylaxis. The events were considered serious as medically significant. The patient stated that side effects mentioned lasted 3 hours and he felt much better now. However, the final clinical outcome was unknown. The patient is not sure if he should get the shot again in 3 weeks since he was really sick.  The reporting physician considered the events &#39;high fever&#39;, &#39;vomiting&#39;, &#39;severe fatigue&#39; and &#39;weakness&#39; related to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on temporal association, the causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the events pyrexia, vomiting, fatigue and asthenia cannot be excluded. The information available in this report is limited and does not allow a medically meaningful assessment. This case will be reassessed once additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                This is spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 61-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at single dose (left arm) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included Blood pressure high, Cancer (Two or less years ago; In remission, Taking medication to follow through with remission period), Allergies and sinus issues, covid virus (in July). The patient reported soreness in the arm (15Jan2021), fatigue (15Jan2021) and  palpitations (16Jan2021) that he felt below the mouth and above the heart, calling it the esophagus area. He wanted to know if others had reported this same palpitation. The reporter further reported that he has a little bit of concern. He felt fine, had sore arm and fatigue that has gone away. Noticed lately, somewhere in his esophagus between his heart and mouth that he is feeling palpitations. Doesn&#39;t know if it&#39;s more indigestion. Stated it could be gas. Sometimes comes and goes, feels different than what he&#39;s already experienced. Wanted to double check if this has been heard of or anything similar to it. Clarified product as first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine. Received last Thursday. Received COVID-19 Vaccine in left arm on 14Jan2021 between 15:00 and 16:00. Both arms are sore, but only because other arm is injured. Pain level in injection arm was around 5-6 and he wasn&#39;t able to sleep on that side. Within the second day, 16Jan2021 in late afternoon soreness and fatigue was gone. Indigestion or Palpitations, feeling was happening again. They wanted to know if that is something he is experiencing from the COVID-19 Vaccine. Stated it doesn&#39;t appear to be related. It is around the esophagus. Stated it affects breathing. Stated maybe that has something to do with it. For the dose, they noticed it was a small amount of fluid in the tube that was injected into him. The outcome of the events soreness in the arm/sore arm and fatigue was recovered on 16Jan2021, while for other events was unknown. Information on the batch number/lot number has been requested.

Intractable liquid diarrhea for 5 days beginning approximately 48 hours after first shot; almost constant Fever; Body Aches; Strong lower back and hip pain; Bilateral pedal edema; dehydration; inability to absorb fluids for 5 days; arm, ankle, hip, back, shoulder, and wrist joint pain; difficulty getting out of bed in the morning, or getting up from the stationary position.  Symptoms finally resolved day 7 just before I anticipated going to ED in local hospital, and were gone for two days.  Symptoms returned on day 9 following vaccination and lasted 5 additional days,  with symptoms resolving for good only on the 15th day after the initial injection.

A 61-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 28Jan2021 09:00 AM at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The vaccine was administered at a hospital. It was not administered at a military facility. He did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving bnt162b2. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications to report.The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK9231, expiry date: not reported, NDC number: 59267-1000-1), on 09Jan2021 09:30 AM on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization, at the age of 61-year-old. He experienced myalgia at the injection site/pain at inject site after the first dose on 09Jan2021 and resolved on 12Jan2021. The first and second doses of bnt162b2 had the same lot number. On 28Jan2021, the patient received the second dose of bnt162b2. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he experienced mild aches/pain, nausea/malaise. Three days (42-72hours) after 2nd dose, on 31Jan2021, he experienced &#34;significant redness&#34; and swelling at injection site with minimal pain. He described it as &#34;Out of proportion to what should be expected&#34;. The redness and swelling were improving at the time of the report (01Feb2021).  He asked if this should be of concern. He also asked if it was possible that the vaccine was given subcutaneously instead of intramuscularly. He developed a good amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. It seemed fine the first day. It took two or more days to develop the swelling. He added that he only had mild myalgia, weakness, and nausea initially on 29Jan2021 after the second dose of the vaccine. Then 48 hours later, he got the large amount of swelling and redness at the injection site. He later clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 9Jan2021 at 09:30 AM in the left arm. He had some myalgia at the injection site on 09Jan2021 that went away on 12Jan2021. Then he received the second dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 28Jan2021 at 09:00 AM in the left arm. Initially he had no pain. 24 hours later, on 29Jan2021, he had myalgia referring to general muscle pain and aches and nausea that only lasted about two hours. He is mostly concerned now about the significant swelling and redness at the injection site with minimal pain which he noticed 48 to 72 hours after the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Tinnitus in left ear.  Soft high-frequency crickets when my throat gets stressed, including hiccups, burping, stretching, sometimes yawning, muscle tensing, sometimes swallowing, stretching to wake up in the morning.  Last for the duration of the stress, a few seconds.  Left eustachian tube slightly sore, slight earache.  Has gone on for almost a week now.   Best guess is nerve is pressured or damaged?  Will try hydroxide in ear next, in hope it kills whatever&#39;s going on.  Whether this will go away or not is unknown at present.

Within an hour, extreme shaking, fatigue and worse headache ever experienced in my life. Went to bed, covered up and tried to rest, but headache was too severe. About 6:00pm, took ibuprofen and headache began to subside, but too weak to walk without holding onto support items. Nausea left me unable to eat and drinking water was unpleasant. Fell asleep about 10pm and woke at midnight with cold shakes and did not get back to sleep. Went to work next morning and just felt somewhat fatigue and had no appetite.

                                                The next day I was very sick. It felt like someone had beaten me up. I spent most of the day lying down and drinking water. I tried to eat something and slept more. When I awoke, it felt like four huge needles piercing my lungs. I had to use my albuterol inhaler it was so bad. My symptoms are normally completely arrested by the use of Advair and Spiriva. The albuterol caused a dry heaving fit during which I expelled quite a bit of phlegm from my lungs. I felt better and the pain went away after that. Since then I&#39;ve been suffering higher levels of chest congestion than is normal for me.

He had the vaccine around 11 am and later that evening, he is not positive of the time but between 7-9 pm, he developed severe swelling of his face and lips and tongue, he also felt nauseated.  He called EMS and they found his bp to be low.  He was not given EPI.  His symptoms resolved on their own but reoccured the following evening; he went to ER and was monitored there; he was not given EPI at the ER.  He was not admitted to the hospital.  Symptoms have not reoccured and he is asymptomatic at this time.   He was not sure if this was releated to the vaccine, but could not identify any new environmental or food items that would have triggered the reaction.

When I woke up on April 14, I was tired but otherwise felt fine except my arm was a bit sore.  However, after working at home for a couple of hours, shortly before 10:00 am I began to feel nauseous. I rushed to the bathroom thinking I was going to throw up, and almost immediately fainted. My wife and sons found me on the floor and woke me up. I threw up shortly after and felt pretty lousy the rest of the day with low grade fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, and a headache. I began to feel better at night and had a good night of sleep. Today (April 15), I feel fine except I&#39;m a little tired.

                                                This patient came in to the community center to receive his 2nd dose of his Pfizer vaccine at approx 10:06am. At approx 10 minutes after sitting in the observation area, the patient started to fee hot, dizzy, some tunneled vision and nausea. This attendee did not have any sort of reaction to his first dose. This was brought to the attention of one of the observing staff members. This nurse,  was called over to the patient. The attendee was asked to lay down on the cot provided and we elevated his legs. RN, measured his vital signs: bp 110/70, HR: 60, Resp 16, O2 97%. This patient denied any shortness of breath. Lung sounds were clear, and no wheezing or rhonchi were observed. This patient stated he has a history of Asthma and took his asthma medications this morning as normally directed. This patient was directed to lay down for approx 10 minutes, then stated he felt much better and wanted to sit up and take a sip of water. The attendee tolerated the water well. This nurse, advised for this attendee to stay for another 10 minutes until he had no symptoms present. The patient quickly felt better and stated that his wife was out in the car and would be driving him home. This nurse advised for him to go to the Emergency Room if he felt any of these symptoms again.

The patient stated he had a sore arm which was okay and runny nose with mucous, which was  similar to his experience with his first shot, but then things went downhill. The patient stated with the first vaccine, he had arm pain that evening and it really wasn&#39;t bad. Stated there was an hour where it was really intense like he got shot up with something pretty powerful, he had a yucky feeling like when you catch the flu and get the first kick and then it went away. Stated he had a runny nose that first came on and lasted pretty much until he got the second vaccine, stated it got not so severe and heavy and decreased until the second shot and then went up again.  Stated with the second vaccine he lost his appetite and he developed nausea in his stomach to the point where he couldn&#39;t eat and every time he did try to eat, it made him really sick. Clarified he did not have vomiting or diarrhea. Stated he just had a horrible feeling in his stomach, almost like the stomach flu.

The patient clarified the phases of his events mimic the flu but unlike the flu, he wasn&#39;t coughing, but he was having the physical pain of the flu but not the normal symptoms you would expect like heavy mucous, coughing, sneezing, like if he had the flu or a cold, but he felt like he was going through the flu. Stated he had muscle aches. States his back is normally okay but he injured it in the past and it started to hurt especially at the points that were injured.

Stated this is a new type of vaccine MRNA and it could just be him. Stated not all vaccines, it seems like flu vaccine kicks him in the keister but has had other vaccines like the MMR and no issues with that, no pain no nothing.

                                                On Friday, April 23/ 2021 @4PM I began to feel pressure built up on my chest. @ 4:15 the pressure also built up on my neck. I was short of breath and I can feel the heartbeat way too high. I recall the person that gave me the first Pfizer shot to get ready for side effects after the second shot. @ 4:30pm the pressure was all over the back, the chest and the neck. Making things worse the jaw and lower teeth were also in extreme pain.  I laid down on the sofa and must have passed out. 20 minutes later I began to come around but I was way weak and the heart beat was beginning to relax. The body pressure was present till 6pm I did not know what to do at that time other than take a nap. I was not able to eat any food until Saturday 6PM.

                                                Nausea started a few days after my second dose. I contacted my PCP . He recommended doing COVID test, which I did at the  Hospital - results were negative. I have ruled out diet as a source of nausea by fasting  (significantly lower food intake than usual).  Stopped drinking tea, which aggravated nausea symptoms. The symptoms persist after 3 weeks! Nausea is strong in the morning, and little better as day goes buy.  I never had this problem in past decade or so, therefore I believe its the vaccine that&#39;s doing this.

Significant flu-like full-body joint pain, moderate fever (100.5 F against a normal base of 97.3), and light nausea. Joint pain continues as is usual for such flares, since some light damage likely occurred in my joints. I was unable to take NSAID or Prednisone (as I normally would for a flare) due to the vaccine. Acetaminophen taken but ineffective. NOTE: My RA is being treated with Rituximab, two doses every 4 months. Next dose scheduled 11 May 2021. Prior dose completed 12 January 2021.

This 61-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 17Mar2021 09:00 (at the age of 61-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Relevant medical history included type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. The patient had allergy to some nuts. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient did not receive any other vaccines within four weeks prior to the vaccination. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 18Mar2021 09:00, 24 hours after his first Pfizer shot, the patient thought that he was having heart attack feelings where he had symptoms of tightness and pain on the chest, nausea, strong gaging, lightheadedness, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cold sweats. These events were resulted in a visit to the Emergency Room. The Hospital Emergency Room diagnosis was &#34;anti-viral reaction to vaccine&#34; for the adverse event. The patient received with IV treatment. As of 24Apr2021, the clinical outcomes of the events &#34;having heart attack feelings where he had symptoms of tightness and pain on the chest, nausea, strong gaging, lightheadedness, fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath and cold sweats&#34; were resolved on an unspecified date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I took his BP and it was 80/60 with a pulse of 60. I called 911 because he had a history of CHF and I didn&#39;t want his pulse to drop and not have other trained personnel on hand if CPR was required. I gave him water to try to raise his BP and rechecked his BP after 5 minutes and it raised to 127/83 with a pulse of 64. He stopped sweating and his color came back in his face at that time. The EMT&#39;s rechecked vitals and ended up taking him to the ED to run tests.

On the second day I started having problems with my vision in my left eye, I went blind for 20minutes. When I did get my Vision back I got and slight headache.  About 3am in the morning, I woke up like someone hit me in the head with a hammer. After that every second or third day the pain would come back and it would be worse, it brought tears to my eyes. I started taking Tylenol but then it stopped working.  it kept kept getting worse and I went to see my Dr. and she put me on some medication, but they did work and she sent me to a Neurologist and he put two medications. They seem to be working, I&#39;m not having them as much. I&#39;m calling tomorrow to see when my appointment is scheduled.

When she asked if it was chest pain, he said he didn&#39;t know.  He went downstairs, vomited, slumped over against the wall behind the couch, and became unresponsive.  Wife called 911 and was instructed to begin CPR.  EMS crew arrived shortly after that and performed prolonged resuscitation efforts as per ACLS protocol.  Pt pronounced at 3:15 am.  Patient had not seen a physician in many years, had not had any vaccines in over 20 years, took no medications, and had no known medical history.  He did have a strong family history of heart disease and had told his wife the week prior to his death that he had suffered a several-hour bout of chest pain that resolved spontaneously 2-3 days prior to his telling her about it.  He refused to seek medical evaluation despite her urging.

At times I have an upset stomach.  I have been checked for Covid 3 times and each time is negative.  I went to the emergency room on March 15.  I was given fluids and an antibiotic through the IV.  I have been to the Dr. multiple times.  They have checked me from head to toe and are puzzled.   This all started the day after I got the first shot.

                                                Soreness on the around the shot site; Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; Has not slept due to pain; cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up; Could not use his arm; 50% deficit with the use of his left arm; After the vaccine, he could not lift his arm above his mid face level; Burning and tingling down the left arm; went to his hand and fingertips and progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot; Burning and tingling down the left arm; went to his hand and fingertips and progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot; Nauseous; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient who is a retired paramedic). A 62-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: ER8732), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 30Mar2021 at 01:00 PM (13:00), as first dose, single, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included bipolar depression from probably 10 years ago (2011) and ongoing, torn rotator cuff (15 to 20 years ago), and food poisoning in mid-Aug2020 (maybe it was more than that; may get tested to see if he ever had COVID-19). The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included vilazodone hydrochloride (VIIBRYD) from 2017 and ongoing (for at least four years) for bipolar depression. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was one of those people who doesn&#39;t get sick and he doesn&#39;t normally get the flu shot and everyone told him to get this Pfizer vaccine. The patient was not panicking but got the first dose of the Pfizer Vaccine on Tuesday (30Mar2021) around 01:00 PM and saw some things about having soreness on the around the shot site and all of that from that night (30Mar2021). This is going on for three days (from 30Mar2021) with severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is; if you ever have pulled a rotator cuff it feels like that and he has not slept in almost 3 days due to pain from 30Mar2021. The pain is severe at times that it makes him nauseous (Mar2021). He figured the soreness was normal and later in the evening on 30Mar2021, the pain became an issue when he tried to go to bed that evening. Since the first two nights compared to last night, the soreness is actually improved; every time he tries to sleep with pain as a factor it is not easy. The patient can feel throbbing with his heartbeat and with the circulation there is throbbing pain. The pain was terrible and was throbbing like his heartbeat and similar to like a shoulder rotator cuff injury. For the first two days, on Tuesday (30Mar2021) and Wednesday (31Mar2021) after the vaccine, he could not use his arm or lift his arm above his mid face level. According to the patient, it was like a rotator cuff and he had a torn rotator cuff 15 to 20 years ago and this is the same arm that his torn rotator cuff occurred in; this is very painful and he is comparing it to the torn rotator cuff. In Mar2021, the patient had burning and tingling down the left arm and 3 days no sleep because the pain is worse at night. During the last week (Mar2021), his left leg down to his foot is also tingling and burning. The patient&#39;s primary care physician just retired, and he is in the process of finding a new one. The patient had no treatment or physician or emergency room (ER) visit for the reported events because being in the ER field, he can tell right now that it would be a waste of time of the effort to go into the ER as they would do nothing but tell him to take paracetamol (TYLENOL) and that is it. The patient did not like to take paracetamol and hates taking paracetamol. The patient clarified it is generic acetaminophen extra strength (Strength: 500 mg; Lot Number: P119682, Expiration Date: Mar2022, UPC Number: 5084417594) that he has taken (maybe every 6 hours oral) and it does relieve the pain so that is only so good. He does not know if in motion of the course of the day, something happened because at night laying still in bed is when he has pain. The patient did a lot of research before he made this call and the severity of the pain is enough to actually keep him awake for three days. He thought it was severe pain; maybe he should have told them to administer the vaccine in his right arm, but it was administered into his left arm. The only reason he made this call was because he wanted someone to know what he was having which could be just completely normal and he is sure every reaction is different and he expected the soreness because he remembers as a kid having shots. Also, this level of pain he is experiencing is what he wanted to report; imagine having  himself going three days without a full night of sleep and he wanted to report this to make sure Pfizer knew this if they were keeping track of numbers of how many people have a similar pain level. The patient also asked if there were other people who called and reported these symptoms and if there is any information or treatment recommendations. As of 08Apr2021, even up to five days after getting the shot, now going on seven days that he has had some pretty severe reactions. The patient called in after 3 nights of getting no sleep. The patient was calling today to see if someone was ever going to call him back and asking will there be a follow up call from someone to see if he&#39;s still alive. The patient had some pretty severe reactions and they have actually gotten worse. There also have been new developments. The patient had pain in his arm that pulses along with his heart rate. It is so bad that it kept him up for 3 nights and still wakes him up at night. The pulsing pain in his arm started on the first night and has gradually gotten worse. The pain in the arm that is enough that it keeps him awake at night only starts getting severe when he goes to bed. He has tried sleeping in an upright position and he has tried everything, and nothing seems to alleviate it. The patient took generic acetaminophen which did not work during his last phone call. The patient also tried naproxen sodium (ALEVE) and that doesn&#39;t work wither. It was absolutely debilitating at times to where he has a 50% deficit with the use of his left arm (Mar2021). The patient initially reported burning and tingling sensation that was on his left arm and went to his hand and fingertips but now it has progressed to the whole left side of his body including his rib line, hip, leg, and foot. He is a retired paramedic and is pretty sure he is not having a long stroke. The patient feels it is too long to have symptoms from a shot he got. The patient has a lot of friends in the medical field and he&#39;s been told even going to a primary care physician, it is kind of gray area when it comes to dealing with COVID-19 vaccines. The patient was having second thoughts about getting the second shot. He had been told he can take NSAIDS over the counter for pain which has not helped him; there is no protocol for diagnosing or treating anything that happens from the shot. People in the medical field have told him there is thin line now to treat side effects because of liability; some doctors won&#39;t even get into it, just refer to Pfizer because medical insurance will not cover any services related to COVID-19 vaccine reactions. The patient continues to explain that is why the federal government is the only one that owns the shot due to liability. The patient&#39;s main concern is calling and reporting and maybe getting some help in deciding whether or not to get the second dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. In his opinion, that is too long to have pain that he cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up. This all happened along with the shot, the same night and there are times where he can&#39;t work due to it. The patient asks if anyone is concerned with it and will someone feel bad because he doesn&#39;t get the second shot. His main concern is that people are underscoring or even lying about side effects, stating he can&#39;t believe he is an isolated case. The patient continued to ask if this is something he&#39;s stuck with, or if it is something he would have to deal with from now on from getting this shot. The patient regrets getting the first shot and stated that if he knew then what he would be going through now, he wouldn&#39;t have got it. The patient has no sort of history of being a hypochondriac and the feelings he is going through right now are sensations that he has never felt in his life. The patient continues to explain he doesn&#39;t even know how to categorize it other than mentally relating it to the shot since it all occurred in line with Mar2021 getting the shot. The patient further commented that if he ran a call with an ambulance right now with a patient telling him what i he was telling the company, he wouldn&#39;t even know what to do with them other than getting them comfortable and to a hospital. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Soreness on the around the shot site&#34;, &#34;Severe arm pain up where the rotator cuff is&#34;, and &#34; Has not slept due to pain; cannot sleep, the pain wakes him up&#34;. The outcome of the other events was unknown.

These are all advertised as common symptoms of the second dose so he did not seek medical treatment until 5/11/21, five days after. He went to the emergency room, his systolic blood pressure was over 200. A CT scan showed bleeding going from his basal ganglia to the right ventricle of his brain. His blood pressure had gotten so high that he had a hemorrhagic stroke. He has since been in the ICU. He had to undergo a ventriculostomy, was put onto a ventilator, and has now had a tracheostomy.  He still has not regained full motor function and will have a long road to recovery after the stroke.

                                                I&#39;ve had Covid (01/2021) and Monoclonal Antibodies (01/2021). Was told to wait 90 days before vaccination (04/29/2021 and 05/20/2021). After Covid I began experiencing severe tiredness, headache, brain fog and muscle pain. No issues after 1st vaccination. About 10 days after 2nd vaccination, the muscle pain started becoming severe. Getting up in the morning, muscle pain in legs (mostly things) started mildly, then became so severe it was impossible to put my full weight on my legs. Am able to &#34;walk it off&#34; after an hour or so. NSAIDS are somewhat effective. Other symptoms include tiredness, headache, muscle pain, generally feeling unwell, joint pain, diarrhea.

                                                31March2021 rec&#39;d the 2nd Pfizer shot. Next morning 1April, multiple stripes of severe muscle pain from both ears, extending down the rear corners of neck across top of both shoulders to the shoulder joints. The 2nd set of severe pain was thin stripes of pain on the left &amp; right sides of the spinal column from the neck to waist. The pain strips along spine disappeared in 3 days. The neck pain has continued to this day with varying intensity, sometimes random increases in pain.  7th of April 2021: Sudden onset of Covid like symptoms: extreme fatigue, extreme nausea, wild swings in perception of body temp from freezing cold which nothing warms me, to internal heat like a very high temp but not exhibiting any outward signs of fever. Felt like internal organs were heating up and nothing else like forehead or limbs etc.  The symptoms of 7April2021 kept up for at least 2 weeks. No symptoms occurred together, each symptom came for varying lengths of time before subsiding and the next symptom surfaced.  Towards the end of April the intensity of the symptoms was easing and eruptions were getting fewer with more time between.  By end of May only the neck pain remained. BUT.... then the other symptoms reappeared in stronger form and still ongoing.

A 62-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 06May2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0171) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included hypertension. Concomitant medication included unspecified blood pressure medications. The patient received the first dose of PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE on 15Apr2021 (Batch/lot number: EW0161) as COVID-19 immunization. Then, the 2nd dose on 06May2021. On that same day of 06May2021, he was feeling nauseous and had a very bad headache. He brushed it off as a side effect of the vaccine because that was listed as a common side effect of the vaccine on the CDC website. So, he did not seek medical attention for 5 days. It was later reported that the he suffered a hemorrhagic stroke that day after the COVID-19 vaccine administration. The patient was in the ICU after waiting 5 days to seek medical attention because the supposed to cause headaches, nausea and vomiting. But the nausea and vomiting was from his stroke, not from the normal side effect of the vaccine. They were suspecting that the bleeding in his brain started on the 07May2021. The patient had bunch of blood work (unknown results) done since the past two weeks. Outcome of the events were unknown

                                                I started to develop a headache and became a little nauseous right after. After two days, my fingers started swelling and hurting. I couldn&#39;t make a fist. It caused my immune system to go crazy. That lasted about 5 days. After taking Aleve and Tylenol, it helped reduce the pain. My kidney doctor told me to stop taking Aleve because it was interacting with my BP meds. The doctor from Northwest Arthritis prescribed Tramadol to help with pain. I still have pain, but it&#39;s tolerable.

                                                I fully understand that this is outside the side effect window.  However, on Sunday, March 14 I started to experience a fever (100.4), fairly significant fatigue,, tireness, loss of appetite and a slight headache.  The reason I am writing is that in addition to getting the vaccine, at which time I was triple-masked, I only left my home one other time to drop off mail at a post office (again, triple masked).  Neither myself nor my wife (the only other person I live with) left the house (other than she left once to pick up our grocery order, outside).  On Sunday, after the symptoms started, I went to a local clinic and took a PCR Covid test.  The results came back negative six hours later.  The symptoms lessened on Monday (the fever ranging from 99.4-100.4----my usual body temp is 97.6) and by Monday night the fever was gone.  By Tuesday morning not only was the fever gone, but so also were all the symptoms.  Again, I know this is outside the usual timeframe for side effects, other than maybe a skin rash, but I wanted to let you know because I think it is unlikely I contracted another virus because I go virtually nowhere, and am tripled masked whenever I go anywhere.

The next day my left eye hurt and would not stop watering. Yesterday it was worse, I had a crooked smile and more severe eye pain and watering, Went to Urgent Care and after ruling out a stroke I was diagnosed with Bell&#39;s palsey.  I have not been diagnosed with Bell&#39;s in the past.

On the 11th day It all came back and more. Dry and soar throat, headache , total loss of energy, no apatite, muscle aches. This has gone on now for 5 days.  On the 2nd day I had a covid test- came back negative. On the 4th day I had another at a different facility, came back negative. Could this still be a reaction to the first vaccine and should I have the second?

A 63-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Mar2021 (at the age of 63 years old) (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing bone cancer, ongoing pain from bone cancer, and nausea (has had nausea with the cancer). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient called about COVID-19 vaccine and mentioned that he received the 1st dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 25Mar2021 and experienced side effects not right away but shortly thereafter. He mentioned that he has bone cancer and he experience a lot of pain due to his bone cancer. He does not have an easy life as he experiences a lot of pain due to his bone cancer. He has a lot of pain to begin with because of the cancer that he has and now pain has been worse recently.  He does not know if it just the progression of the pain or if it is coming from the injection.  The patient confirmed that he experienced lists of side effects of more tired/tiredness, more headaches/headache, muscle pain, joint pain, injection site swelling and redness, slight nausea, feeling unwell, and swollen lymph nodes. He still feels very sick, is in a lot of pain, and not feeling well. He confirmed this list is from the paperwork he was given and adds that the only thing that he feels is light nausea that is not very severe.  He added that he has had nausea with the cancer, so this nausea would be very light.  But, he also he has a headache and tiredness. The patient added that his pain has increased, and the pain is the worst. The patient did not know how long it will take before feeling side effects from the vaccine or how that works.  The patient asked if the side effects is same for everyone or if it is different for everybody. He added that reporting the event is not going to help in finding out where he is going with this.  He stated he is at a crossroads, trying to determine if he needs to increase his pain medication since he now has more pain. He understands that Pfizer does not provide medical advice.  He states that he was asking Pfizer to see if Pfizer has an understanding of when these side effects might show themselves or when they would and how severe they would come. His second vaccination is due on 15Apr2021. Outcome of the events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

He got more confused, more dizzy, and worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s.   He was very thirsty and drank a lot of water (4 liters of bottled water).  He was then urinating and sweating a lot as a way of his body trying to get rid of something in his body.  He was urinating more than he normally does.  He started getting harder for him to breath.  He noticed he had a bad taste in his mouth similar to when he had the COVID virus.  He got a horrible splitting headache/migraine type that kept coming and going.  He still has the taste in his mouth, and it affected the taste of food.  These were all symptoms similar to when he had COVID.  The headache was worse than when he had the virus.  No appetite still, but still continuing to drink the water and not urinating like you did the first day and a half.  He is not having to drink as much as he did before and not feeling like he was dehydrating.  Does have the soreness from the vaccine or any rashes. He did have chills and low grade fever of about 100-101, which have resolved.  He also had a sore throat which he still has.   He had a very bad case of the COVID virus 3/1/21, which lasted for a week or two.  He still has some residual symptoms from the virus with balancing/dizziness or worsening of his Parkinson&#39;s disease.  His neurologist told him that he would recover from the cognitive effects from the COVID with his Parkinson&#39;s, but his motor skills may not return.

A 63-year-old male consumer (patient) received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: EN6198) via an unspecified route of administration into the left arm on 28Feb2021 16:30 (at the age of 63-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history included type 2 diabetic. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that he was calling to report a reaction to his first vaccine dose. He had no medical questions at this time and requested to be transferred to safety. 30 calls ahead, caller was agreeable to holding for the safety department. Got COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday afternoon 28Feb2021. Was okay after the fifteen-minute waiting period. Got home and took a nap. On 28Feb2021, the patient woke up at around 6:30 PM, he was feeling a bit nauseous. He drank ginger ale and went back to bed. On 01Mar2021 at around 01:30, he reported of everything hurt and thought he had the flu/ flu symptoms, could not lift left arm, chills, temperature got up to 99.2 and bed sweats where he had to change his bed and t-shirt twice. Never had a fever, but his temperature got up to 99.2. Last time he had the flu was 10 years ago, which was why he thought he must have the flu. Thought it was a coincidence he received his COVID-19 Vaccine and then got the flu. That morning, 02Mar2021, he felt great. On an unspecified date, he reported that his left arm was very swollen from shoulder to his neck, stiff arm and stiff neck, headache, dizziness, muscle and joint aches. Did not know what that was, but glad it was gone. His left arm was the injection arm. Arm was very swollen from his shoulder to neck. He felt his armpit and did not feel like his lymph nodes were swollen. Felt like a stiff neck and stiff arm. Did not have any trouble breathing. Did not have heart palpitations. No prior vaccinations within four weeks. He tested positive for COVID-19 Virus on 01Feb2021 around 4:30PM. Believes it was a PCR COVID-19 test. End of his isolation was 11Feb2021 and he tested negative. Was getting tested for a procedure that was scheduled for 03Feb2021. However, the procedure is now moved to 15Mar2021. No further details provided. Last vaccination was a Tdap and he did not have any problems with that. Tdap was forever ago and has no NDC/Lot/Exp to provide. Would like to speak to a consulting Nurse. Had first dose of covid vaccine and had bad reaction. Has surgery scheduled very close to second dose appointment of vaccine. Clarified surgery was scheduled before first dose of vaccine. Wants to know with having reaction to first dose and being close to surgery, should he get second dose. No unaddressed medical questions referred or forwarded to Medical Information. He was having surgery (hip replacement) on 29Mar2021 and was scheduled for his second Pfizer vaccine on 30Mar2021. Since he had several side effects with the first vaccine dose, he enquired that should he not get the second vaccine dose the day before his scheduled surgery. He was having a heck of a time getting scheduled for his second dose, window was supposed to be 20-25 and he was able to get it scheduled on the 28th, he had a severe reaction to the first dose, night sweats, no fever, but classic flu symptoms, lasted about 24 hours, started on 1:30am Monday morning is when he started having the symptoms. Had shot Sunday afternoon 28Feb2021. He was having a hip replacement on 29Mar2021, will it be a problem if he has another reaction, cannot cancel surgery. First surgery was cancelled because he tested positive for Covid on 01Feb2021, prior to vaccine, tested negative for covid on 11Feb2021, hip issues and surgery were scheduled prior to vaccine. Was it okay for him to get his hip surgery the day after his second dose of the vaccine. Investigation assessment was unknown.

Bloodwork done, EKG showed irregular rythm, referred to cardiologist. Feeling better at time of visit, all additional tests ok. Weeks of extreme fatigue and lightheadness occur for periords lasting 6-24 hours at average. Any major activity would cause debilitating weakeness the next day. Felt so badly one night, thought he was dying, didn&#39;t go to ER (was affraid of expense). Another day again we drove to ER, but started feeling better during wait time and decided not to stay.  Was going to return if not feeling good, but felt better for 3 days, longest period to date.

All symptoms continued to get worse for 2 weeks after initial dose. Took 1600 mg of ibuprofen daily to reduce symptoms with limited success. Stopped ibuprofen after 1 week due to upset stomach. Used natural anti-inflammatories (alpha lipoic acid 600 mg).Dizziness and balance problems improved and were mostly resolved by the end of week 4. Brain fog slowly improved and  mostly resolved by the end of week 5. Inflammation in head still present around right ear even after week 7. Inflammation is the worst sleeping flat on back. Must sleep in reclined position.

                                                he has cold like symptoms; Stuffed up nose; doesn&#39;t feel really good; pain in the site area; slept a lot and was tired; slept a lot and was tired; his stomach is nauseous and queasy; This is a spontaneous report from a Pfizer-sponsored program. A contactable consumer reported that a 64-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration in Jan2021 (also reported as &#34;around 19Jan2021&#34; or &#34;19Jan2021 or 20Jan2021&#34;, pending clarification) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient got his first COVID dose around 19Jan2021 (also reported as &#34;19Jan2021 or 20Jan2021&#34;) and now he has cold like symptoms. Stuffed up nose, doesn&#39;t feel really good and wanted to know if this part of the COVID vaccine. On the first day, he had pain in the site area, slept a lot and was tired. It has been 10 days since the shot and he had symptoms of a cold and his stomach was nauseous and queasy (also reported as squeezy). The reporter wanted to know if this was a part of the side effects or does she need to call his primary care. She was told about symptoms to watch for within the first seven days and this was well beyond the seven days. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient reports pain as severe, 10/10, in the mid-lower abdomen, constant with radiation to the right LQ. He reports N/V as well. Of note, patient is on chemotherapy (currently FOLFIRI/cetuximab) and follows with an oncologist for his colon cancer. His oncologist believes that the cause of his presentation is due to him taking Imodium for his chemo-induced diarrhea.  Patient remains hospitalized at this time.

                                                About 21 hrs after shot I experienced significant dizziness and almost fainted. I have continued to experience slight dizziness from time to time but only severe when lying down, rolling over while lying down, looking straight up, and sometimes bending over.  5 days after shot I decided to check blood presure and it was repeatedly around 175/100. I went to local doctor and he prescribed additional BP meds. BP now good (126/80) but I still experience dizziness from time to time. Yesterday when BP high I also had constant headache and some nausea. Today(3/12), almost week after shot I still experience dizziness to a minor degree off and on, but still somewhat severe when lying down, looking up, and bending over

I was very concerned, but I drink plenty of fluids and lot of food supplements that I was able to endure it.  This situation lasted for a little over a week and I decided to go to the ER, but first  tried taking Zinc.  The zinc was recommended by many of my customers at the pharmacy as a Covid reliver.   It worked on the first DAY!  I feel fine now and the diarrhea is gone.  I may have had Covid again or a reaction to the vaccination.  I had Covid last March that had the same explosive diarrhea, but it only lasted a day!

I fought against the symptoms.

                                                At about 10:30 on the evening of receiving the vaccine I started to get chills and became feverish. This ended at about 4 a.m. and did not return, but in the morning I had no appetite and had diarrhea. My appetite returned the following day but I also had an issue with my taste being off that lasted for 2 days after the vaccine. Basically with the second shot I got all of the symptoms I had when I got covid in November. After the first shot I only got about half of these symptoms.

                                                I had painful breathing in the upper right quad of my abdomen. The deeper I took a breath, the more it hurt. The onset was on that Thursday. I am a right side sleeper and I couldn&#39;t sleep on that right side. I went back to the surgeon who removed my gallbladder. No treatment was given because no cause of the pain could be found. I started feeling less pain while breathing while I was in the waiting room. Over the next 3 days, the pain got gradually less to a point where it was not hurting at all.

He stated he was not eating due to the pain, and that nausea and vomiting would occur when eating.  His wife and son both tested positive for COVID-19 per PCR on 1/29 (unknown what type of test).  He was tested on 1/25 prior to vaccination and was negative at that time.  He ended up going to the ER later that day and is recorded as having a fever and cough at that time, in addition to the pain as described above.  Pt tested positive at this time on admission testing (2/5/2021).  He is still currently inpatient at our facility.

                                                Patient received his first Pfizer COVID vaccine on 3/3/21. Patient was conscious with no apparent issues after administration. Patient was asked to sit down for 15-minute observation afterwards. A few minutes later patient was swaying back and forth in his chair and saying he was feeling faint. I repeatedly addressed patient by his first name and asked if he could hear me and repeatedly asked if he was okay. Patient began slumping down in his chair but was still conscious. Patient was not responsive but made eye contact with me. Patient requested water. After giving patient water and observing him drink he began looking nauseous and threw up. Patient then passed out in his chair. I supported the patient upright in his chair and made sure he did not fall down or injure his head. I then immediately tapped him on both shoulders and repeatedly called his name. Patient then became responsive and 911 was called. While waiting patient said he was starting to feel better and was able to support himself in his chair. I did not observe any injuries due to fainting. When the ambulance came patient agreed to be taken to the hospital.

                                                Slight soreness in left arm around and just below the point of injection.  This went away around 6PM on Tuesday, the day after the injection.  For about 2 hours around 10PM until I went to sleep on Monday night (the night of the injection), I had a slight fever but it was only slight.  I had a more intense fever (though for only 30 minutes) the evening that I had my flu shot last October when I visited my doctor for a check up, so I would definitely categorize the fever from the COVID-19 shot as very slight.  It was gone when I woke up in the morning.  After I woke up, I was a bit nauseous, but it was so slight (and I have not been nauseous for well over a year) that it took me awhile to actually recognize it as being nauseous.  This lasted for 15-20 minutes and then it disappeared.  On Wednesday morning, my heart went into an irregular heartbeat that felt different than what I feel when it goes into an irregular heartbeat.  I have no idea if there is any relation between receiving the vaccine and getting an irregular heartbeat but I thought I should report it.  I have recovered from all symptoms from the vaccination except the irregular heartbeat.  I put down as &#34;unknown&#34; if I have recovered  from the adverse events as I don&#39;t know if going into an irregular heartbeat was in any way related to the vaccination.

                                                Oral thrush with plaques in the back of throat and uvula. Difficult/painful swallowing. I have been treating myself empirically with Mylanta, Rolaids, gargling salty water alternating with diluted listerine, honey, and basically a soft diet. I experienced headaches, general fatigue, and diarrhea as well, no fever, cough,not even pain or swelling at site of injection. I must said that I am feeling better, but still have soreness when swallowing, and I have lost 4 lbs. I do not know if this is a common side effect,so I decided to report it, I am on Humira due to my AS.

This 65-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 22Mar2021 probably around noon (at age of 65 years old; lot number: ER8730) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed about 10 years ago and diabetes type 2 diagnosed about 10 years ago (as of 24Mar2021). He caught COVID a few months ago (as of 24Mar2021) and was sick for 3 weeks and then came out of that and at that time got a rash and came out of that and wanted to get the vaccine because he was age 65 and did not want this thing to kill him. Concomitant medication(s) included gabapentin 300mg, 1 capsule three times per day by mouth, taken for neuropathy in his hands and his hands hurt from 22Mar2021 and ongoing. He was given the gabapentin to stop his hands from hurting. He also had medications he took every day and had diabetes type 2, and also had high blood pressure that he took medication for. No additional vaccines were administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. There were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks of the Pfizer vaccine. The patient reported he saw his healthcare professional (HCP) for the first time the same day he got the Pfizer Vaccine on 22Mar2021 and saw the HCP that morning. When he left he felt fine that day 22Mar2021 and felt fine that night. That night he tore up his bedroom and cleaned it and felt fine. Then the next morning (23Mar2021) he went to work and felt fine for a while and then got to building. He started working and then felt like he was in slow motion and couldn&#39;t think and it was crazy and his mind was blank and he could not think and felt like he was in slow motion; couldn&#39;t think to do anything. The feeling like he was in slow motion and not being able to think began yesterday morning on 23Mar2021 and stopped yesterday 23Mar2021 also. Yesterday he came home because he runs saws at work and stuff like that and he couldn&#39;t think and couldn&#39;t be around stuff like that because he was cutting things and could get hurt. He had not had this happen before and the feeling as if he couldn&#39;t think and felt in slow motion was not ongoing today, 24Mar2021. Today he now has nausea and the nausea was ongoing and about the same as when it began. Also stated as today (24Mar2021) he felt kind of nauseated and couldn&#39;t do anything again today and thought he would stay home because of these small side effects of the vaccine that he wanted to report. He had no treatment for the reported events but just went home and laid down. The events did not require an emergency room visit. Regarding whether the events required a visit to physician office the patient replied &#34;Yes&#34;, he saw his HCP the morning of the day he got the vaccine on 22Mar2021. Patient was going to call the HCP to see if the medication she gave him would have these side effects and he had not taken the Gabapentin before; stated the HCP issued him Gabapentin that he began taking on 22Mar2021. He was calling the HCP to see if the reported events were related to the gabapentin as he had not taken that before. &#34;Feeling like he was in slow motion and not being able to think&#34; was recovered on 23Mar2021 and patient had not recovered from nauseated.

I have a steady temperature of 98.0  I do not have a sore throat or a runny nose.  although that is because of the Allegra.  sorry I forgot to include that in my meds list.   there has been no change or improvement so far.   I am in great physical and mental health prior to this.   very fit.    need motrin pills to cope and sleep.   what is most likely going on??

A 65-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8736), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 03May2021 (at the age of 65-year-old,) as a single dose for Covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history, family history and concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not experience any adverse event prior Covid vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccination. On 03May2021, it was reported that 5 min after the vaccine dose around 13:30 to 14:00 in the afternoon the patient&#39;s hands fell asleep, and the fire department had to walk him around for a bit. Six or seven days later after Covid vaccination on 09May2021, the patient was dizzy (time unknown), and, in the afternoon, he felt nauseous and experienced diarrhea and flu like symptoms, on the same day in the evening he also had low grade fever. The patient did not visit emergency room for events. The patient did not received treatment for dizzy and flu like symptoms. Therapeutic measures were taken, because of diarrhea he took Imodium (a week before he visited physician office) and Tylenol for low grade fever. Treatment for nauseous was not reported. No investigation assessment was reported. No relevant tests were performed. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Sars-Cov-2 antibody test: result was negative. The reporter did not specify event seriousness. No product quality complaint was reported. The patient visited the physician office after it was over to get doctors opinion. Everything went away and the patient did not know if it was a reaction or food poisoning and the doctor said it was a reaction to Covid vaccine. The patient reported that he was supposed to get second dose of vaccine and he would like to know that if he should get second dose or not because he recorded an Adverse event with DSU on 24May2021. The reporter also mentioned that since his second dose was on 24May2021 (reported as today), would it screw things up if he did not get the second dose on the date of report 24May2021 (today). The patient states that his provider says that his side effects are from vaccine and he would be putting him on medication for side effects. The patient also queried that would it screw things up if he waits for a week or so before going back to get the second dose. The patient dug through when he got back on 24May2021 (today), he was curious if it is advisable to go back after the reactions. Attempted was made to explain to the patient that we&#39; would not be able to tell him whether or not to go back for his second dose and that we suggest he reach out to primary care provider for more information.

                                                I was monitored the recommended 15 minutes and was fine. I went to the car, was being driven home, and about 20 minutes after the vaccination I developed an odd sweet/metallic taste in my mouth, followed by increased saliva, some difficulty swallowing, nasal congestion, and some chest discomfort. They symptoms were already getting a little better by the time we got home (about 30 minutes after the shot), but I took a Benadryl and the symptoms resolved within 2 hours. After that I just had the expected arm pain and fatigue until the next morning. Since then I have been fine.

COVID-19 vaccine NDC: Unknown, this was not provided on his handwritten vaccine card. Caller says he also had the flu vaccine 2-3 months ago and the flu vaccine also made him sick as hell, the same thing happened. unspecified flu vaccine NDC/LOT/EXP: Unknown. Caller says that his allergic reaction is that he has no energy and no appetite. He says after the flu vaccine he had zero energy and ended up losing weight. He says he has felt like this again since getting COVID-19 vaccine yesterday and has been in bed all day. He says he had a fever this morning and a splitting headache. He says his fever temperature was unknown, he had done no treatment for that, he laid in bed all day, and he has done no treatment for the headache either, though he is thinking about taking some Tylenol in a minute. He says he wants to get better and he might need to call his doctor for information about what to do to get better, he just wanted to see if Pfizer could provide any solutions for him. The clinical outcome of the events was reported as unknown.

                                                Pfizer vaccine injected 3:00 PM  3/10/21.  The next day, 27 hours post-vaccine injection, while in a store, patient noted at 6:06 PM onset of numbness/tingling Right foot/leg with difficulty standing/lifting foot.  He needed support of shopping cart to make it to car.  Once in car, numbness/tingling, heaviness/clumsiness of right hand/arm noted.  Then right side of lips/mouth affected with dysarthria.  Wife witnessed evolution and drove directly to Hospital ER/stroke center by which time patient was vomiting and required wheelchair to enter ER.  Stroke team evaluation neurologist concluded ischemic stroke and administered TPA.  During TPA infusion, all symptoms resolved remarkably so that dysarthria cleared, numbness resolved and dysmetria/fine motor incoordination/right hand/arm/leg/foot symptoms were markedly improved.  Patient admitted to ICU for one day and then neurocare floor for one day.  MRI showed 8 mm linear diffusion weighted lesion in right centrum semiovale which was deemed c/w acute/subacute infarct.  Attending neurologist in ICU and neurofloor noted that location laterality of MRI lesion did not correlate well with the right-sided patient symptoms, but could not identify other left brain lesions on review of scans.  EKG, TEE and echo studies showed no cardiac lesions.  Carotid studies were negative.  CT and CT angio were uninformative;  no hemorrhagic lesions or large vessel blockage.  At discharge on 3/14/2021 around 6 PM,  patient could walk, talk, and use hands essentially normally to outside observer although patient could relate intermittent brief episodes of possible numbness in lips or hands/fingers or slight heaviness of foot which is slight and decreasing.  Patient discharged on atorvastatin, amlodipine, fluticasone, Loratadine, 81 mg aspirin, Ibuprofen (for headaches) for further post-stroke follow-up.

                                                Vomiting; This is a spontaneous case received from a contactable Pharmacist. A 66-years-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EL3248), intramuscular, administered in left deltoid on 03Feb2021 at14:00 (the age of 66-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included neoplasm malignant from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and chemotherapy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162b2 on 15Jan2021 at 13:28 in the left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation. On 05Feb2021 at 04:00, after the second vaccination, the patient experienced vomiting. Patient thought the vomiting could be in part to chemotherapy he had; the last treatment was about 2 months before his first dose of the vaccine. No admission to the hospital was required due to the event. COVID-19 vaccine was accidently mixed with sterile water for injection instead of Sodium chloride 0.9% for injection. Error was made in part of education for diluent use. Clinical outcome of the event vomiting was recovered.

                                                Five days after my second vaccine, at about 8 am, I developed fairly diffuse abdominal pain, and retching.  I left work and went home.  This lasted for about 3 to 4 hours, then let up, but then developed about 45 minutes of profound rigors, which then let up, then my temperature (had been normal) went up to less than 102 F.  For the next six days I continued to run fever, never higher than 103, chills, and some migrating abdominal pain, no diarrhea, normal stools, constipated if anything.  Stayed home from work obviously.  On Sunday, and Monday am, still running fevers, my pain seemed to settle into my right lower quadrant.      My wife, a family physician, helped arrange a CT scan Abdomen and Pelvis, as we were concerned about appendicitis, maybe an abscess.  The scan revealed normal appendix, but several lesions in the right side of the liver thought highly suspicious for &#34;metastatic disease.&#34;  MRI recommended, and had this Wednesday that week, and it confirmed the lesions, with characteristics suspicious for metastatic tumors.  By Monday afternoon, my fever abated, and I felt much better.  Able to return to work.  The abdominal discomfort was improved, maybe due to constipation.  Friday of that week, I was able to get to see my primary provider, who is in Omaha, NE to review the situation, and we agreed a liver biopsy was needed.       A week later, Friday, Jan. 29, I had CT guided liver biopsy at  hospital in Omaha. 16 cores taken, and no malignancy found, but significant inflammatory cells, especially lymphocytes.  Meanwhile I have felt fine.  Decided to do a follow up MRI of liver, which was done Friday, April 2, and all the areas have resolved.    There is an entity called &#34;Inflammatory pseudotumors&#34; of the liver, and my condition fits with this.  It is very rare.     A consideration would be whether it would be possible to stain the biopsy to see if the lymphocytes carry antibodies to the corona virus.

I came to a few moments later when I heard my wife calling my name.  For the next two minutes or so I was very nauseous, but I did not vomit.  The nausea quickly passed and there were no further fainting episodes or dizziness.  I was a bit achy over the next 24 hours, but no further or additional symptoms to report.   ,

She stated that the dehydration and constipation could have been self induced. This started about last week and was home all week. It may have been around 29Mar2021, about 2 weeks after the vaccination. On day 3, her husband had headaches and fatigue on 17Mar2021. The patient was taking Tylenol pretty much every four hours for a week because he was in so much pain. The patient wear APAP machine at night. No history of all previously immunizations.

He went to a clinic yesterday for a PCR test and it came out positive. He&#39;s getting conflicting information as to what needs to be done, some people are telling him he has to wait for 3 months, other are telling him to notify his PCP.

His fever lasted almost 3 weeks using Ibuprofen and Tylenol twice a day ever day with his fever rarely breaking. I took him to the ER at Hospital on Monday, May 10th. They diagnosed him with Colitis after reviewing a CT scan of his abdomen. He was discharged back home later that evening where he continued on to oral antibiotics: Flagil and Levaquin for 10 days. He was in bed for over 4 weeks with no appetite and lost approximately 15 pounds. It made his chronic vertigo worse with increased memory loss and loss of dexterity in fingers.

                                                Pancreatitis in tail of pancreas; fever (101.2F) for four days; left side abdominal pain; diverticulitis; headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting on behalf of patient. A 66-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EP7533) as 1st dose single for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing high cholesterol which was diagnosed decades ago at least, kidney stone. Concomitant medication included simvastatin (strength: 20mg) from 2011 and ongoing. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. The reporting physician is the patient&#39;s primary care physician. The patient came to the physician&#39;s office on 16Apr2021 for the fever, left sided abdominal pain, and headache which had been going on for 4 days in Apr2021.  Physician reported that the patient thought his left-sided abdominal pain was caused by a kidney stone. Because of the high fever of 101.2 and the persistence of 4 days of fever, the patient was admitted to the hospital. Patient had an elevated white blood cell count of 13000.  The patient had a very high D-dimer test which kept rising. The patient&#39;s C-Reactive Protein was very high. white blood cell count was 12.6 on admission and went to 6.8 after IV antibiotics were administered. The patient&#39;s fever resolved within 24 hours of starting IV antibiotics and fluids. When queried for seriousness criteria, physician reported that the patient&#39;s headache was just nagging.  Physician reported that he doesn&#39;t have the patient&#39;s chart, but he is guessing that the patient&#39;s headache resolved within 3 days of admission to hospital. Regarding pancreatitis in tail of pancreas, physician reported that there was a possibility that the patient&#39;s abdominal pain was diverticulitis, it was unclear if the inflammation was from diverticulitis or the pancreas.  Physician reported that the patient had a GI consult.  Physician reported that the GI provider did an MRI on the patient&#39;s abdomen and the final word was pancreatitis. Physician reported that since the patient was hospitalized, all of the inflammatory markers, D-dimer, sed rate, CRP, have come down.  Physician stated something happened.  The patient has no risk factors for pancreatitis. He doesn&#39;t drink, isn&#39;t on any medications that would cause pancreatitis, doesn&#39;t have high triglycerides, and doesn&#39;t have gallstones; the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine was the only variable.  Physician is thinking that the whole inflammatory process was part of a reaction to the Covid-19 vaccine. Patient is clinically recovered, he was hospitalized from 16Apr2021 to 22Apr2021. Physician reported that the patient hasn&#39;t been checked radiologically but the physician is hoping to repeat the patient&#39;s MRI in a couple of weeks. He eventually got better and went home.  He is now wondering if he should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Physician is a little hesitant to tell the patient whether or not the patient should get the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  Physician does not know if the patient&#39;s adverse events were related to the Covid-19 vaccine and stated that risking another pancreatitis episode is a big deal.

Patient stated: he got sick on 06May2021 in the middle of the night, at 2:30 AM and he layed on the floor for almost 6 hours vomiting and finally he didn&#39;t have anything left, then the cramp started from dehydration in every muscle of my body, luckily not his heart, and that was with cold sweats, he could not get warm he kept trying he did everything. Also it was so uncontrollable that he could not walk either, the muscles cramps, he finally did - he fought that at 66 years of age, which sounds young but he was old, that he couldn&#39;t control number 2 either, because it was fully out of control and peeing, everything was just going out of his body, he could not stop it, there was no blood. He didn&#39;t know where he was. He finally fell asleep. He got up after that, got my cane and got into the kitchen I got a Water with nutrients and vitamins, that night he went to bed, everything was back to normal he was still having cold sweats and then eventually that went away, and he was not feeling well until the first week of May, not feeling himself. He received second dose late because he live by himself, he getting dizzy he need to go back and sit down, this is weird, he already disabled, he been disabled like this he forgetting things like this too, his daughter was a Nurse and told him he forgetting things, his mouth was getting dry ,one more question that&#39;s all how long? he have nausea a lot, he is on on medication for nausea - it crosses blood-brain barrier and he don&#39;t like it, but That&#39;s not even working anymore. How long does this nausea effect, what he felt wasn&#39;t all the time but now it&#39;s all the time, it&#39;s not a heavy nausea it&#39;s not like he going to throw up, it just feels like he have it all the time. He have systemic sporosis, he have raynaud&#39;s (disease), he have gastroparesis and an implant (stomach). He was been sick a long time, he used to being sick, nothing he can do about the headache and nausea, but he want to do this to help everybody with disability and children, his disabilities make it all worse. He was having symptoms and wants to know if they are normal. He does not see if on the paperwork. He feels bad. He was disabled and has gastroparesis, which was prior to getting the vaccines. He has nausea and everything else from the gastroparesis, but the cold, sweaty, and cold feeling occurred since the first shot. First shot was on 03Apr2021. He could not get another shot because he was too sick with his illnesses that he has. He has a Pacemaker for his stomach. All were prior to getting vaccine. He stated he was in the hospital twice for his dizziness but later clarified that he was only kept overnight once. They originally thought he had benign postural vertigo. They did the emily movements in physical therapy to move the crystals in your ears. It seemed to work ok, but today, it feels the same. He walks around and won&#39;t go too far. He is hoarse, but does not have a temperature and is not sore. No further details provided. He goes from being soaking wet to soaking and freezing. He said he is in a good mood, just does not feel good. He lost 15 pounds in 3 weeks or less since he has had the vaccine. He was not trying to. He was laying on the floor and a bunch of other things.

He was soaking wet with sweat, shaking and could hardly walk if at all and then not at all. He was on all fours. He grabbed nearest blanket and sat on top of that with a trash can on all fours. He had a heating blanket and threw it over the top to warm up and was shaking. He could not control anything. He was too shaky. Finally, he layed down on the floor, covered up and stayed warm. He kept wiping sweat off. People that have gastroparesis are immunosuppressed and he was scared of what would happen when he got the shot. He got first shot on 03Apr2021. 0n 04Apr2021, he fell off a ladder. On 05Apr2021, he started getting dizzy during the day. He was nauseated most of the time and still is up until now.

No further details provided on Meclizine. Dizziness came back at the time of report and was persisting with walking. He can walk ok, but still feels woozy. His legs feel weak today and were not previous day. His arms also feel weak. He used wheelchair for first two days after receiving the first dose. Then it improved. His arms stayed the same. Vomiting started 02:30 am. It was the worse that he had in his life. He could not catch his breath and started having diarrhea after that. He had complete muscle dehydration. His fingers and toes were cramped and his left arm was going out straight. He layed there an tried to untie everything. He drank Essential water to get everything back in his body. The cramps went away later that day. He was feeling good by the end of 06Apr2021. During that time, he thought he was going to have a heart attack because all of his muscles were cramping. He gets dehydrated quite often. This was prior to taking the vaccine because of his gastroparesis. He said he got C-Diff because the antibiotics they gave him for helicobacter pylori killed everything off. He only remembers the name of one of the antibiotics that did that, flagyl.

                                                My husband has had a fever and extreme exhaustion every day, all day. for 16 days, since he go the Pfizer vaccine. He is retaining water, does not sleep at night, has heavy night sweats, and is emotionally spent. He has no appetite and forces himself to eat. He tastes what little food he eats. He visited his family doctor, a gastroenterologist, and has been in the emergency room two times for sheer exhaustion and pain. He was released both times after tests. Each time, no one could find a cause and no one sent him to other doctors for help. They would not admit him because there was no guarantee he could see other doctors any faster than if he were at home making appointments. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist by the gastroenterologist, but that appointment  isn&#39;t until March 9, 2021. He will have faded even more by then.

The first 12 hours were the worst, but after 36 hours all symptoms were gone.   DETAIL The Feb 3, 2021 First vaccine - Phizer Feb 18, 2021      5:00 pm suddenly came down with shaking throughout my body and then chills.        6:00 pm shaking subsided       7:00 pm entire body aches from head to feet      Later in evening - fever throughout body Feb 19, 2021 feeling better, but still muscle and joint pain throughout body.  Some slight fever.  No appetite, but can smell chicken broth.  February 20, 2021 feeling better but tired      10:00 am COVID test at pharmacy.      Noon ate peanut butter and crackers      2:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      6:30 pm ate full Mexican dinner  February 21, 2021 feeling good with a good appetite.  NO SYMPTOMS.       9:30 am breakfast      1:00 pm sat outside for 30 minutes      1:30 pm lunch REFLECTION: During entire time, no difficulty breathing or coughing.  And the other symptoms came and went in 36 hours.  The symptoms I did have are the same as a bad reaction to the 2nd vaccine.  (my muscle aches are not a reaction to the vaccine).  Yet, my reaction was not immediate, rather it was 2 weeks and 1 day after my first vaccine.  Therefore, do I have COVID, or a bad reaction to my first vaccine? WAITING for COVID test results.  Second vaccination is scheduled for upcoming Friday, February 26.

A 67-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Lot number EN6200 , on 17Feb2021 at single dose in arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number ELI283) on 27Jan2021 and had no adverse effect. The patient was wondering if he hold the current record for the number of days consecutive for a person to have adverse reaction to the second vaccine because it was over a week and he could not move out of his bed. That almost killed him. His vision was also blurred. His weight was dropping rather rapidly because he was not able to eat. The outcome of the events was unknown.

A 67-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6203; Expiration Date: 30Jun2021) intramuscularly (in the muscle) in right shoulder on 14Mar2021 at age of 67-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medication included ibuprofen for an unspecified indication, but the reason for taken this drug was &#34;get up and get moving&#34;, the patient took it for many years. Received call from consumer regarding the Pfizer COVID vaccine.  He would like to speak with someone about the effects he had and any suggestions Pfizer may have to help him. There was no prescriber for the vaccine. He received the first dose on 14Mar2021 and on 19Mar2021, he started experiencing side effects. He said all 4 people in his household all got the vaccine and all had side effects. The moment the patient was helping his wife he felt like a sharp needle type pain going through the heart side of his chest. They were little ones, but it was uncomfortable. It caused him to panic. He hanged on to it and it went away in a bit. But 2 hours after that, he had chills and crawled in blankets and stayed until the rest of the night. He has not gotten up since 19Mar2021.  He has bone aches and leg and lower back pain aches. He has a headache on 19Mar2021 and started checking temperature on 25Mar2021. The highest was 104 degrees on 25Mar2021 and ever since (Mar2021) then he had 101 degrees or 100 and something. It also reported he began to have fever on 19Mar2021 (pending clarification). He was told to use Tylenol for fever reducer and started taking it. It also reported he has been taking Tylenol for the headache and fever only and it has not been working, it has actually caused him to have a rash on his face and skull causing dandruff and severe itching and bleeding, so he stopped it. He would like to take Ibuprofen and wanted to know if he could.  When he stopped taking Tylenol, his daughter gave him a lotion for face.  Face is clear and only one place is left that is behind his neck on head.  No further details provided for lotion that he put on the rash. He provided information on Tylenol Extra Strength 500 mg each. He took 2 for rash on 2 occasions every 6 hours and then he started only taking 1 because he has not eaten and felt bitterness in stomach and mouth and was uncomfortable (19Mar2021). The Lot is SSA011 and expiration is Oct2024. He has been taking Ibuprofen for many years and only taking one tablet instead of two. He needs to get up and get going and takes it to help him every day. He did not get tested for COVID, but his wife, son and daughter did and they all tested positive after receiving the vaccine. He assumes he has COVID as well since he has the same symptoms and lives in the same household. He would like to know if he can postpone next dose or can he quit.  Will this get better. If he could take Ibuprofen instead of Tylenol. The outcome of events &#34;sharp needle type pain that went through heart side of chest&#34; and &#34;chills&#34; was recovering, of &#34;fever/ highest was 104 degrees&#34;, &#34;bone aches&#34;, and &#34;leg and lower back pain&#34; was not recovered, of other events was unknown.

A 67-years-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, in local center, via an unspecified route of administration, in left deltoid on 10Mar2021 at 09:30, at 67 years of age, (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing sarcoidosis he has had for at least 35 years, oozing leg from 2019 and &#34;underlying health issues&#34;. He had bloodwork done 3 times and it came back negative for COVID-19: he had one done in Mar2020, one done in Jun2020, and one done three months before this report (Dec2020). Historical vaccine included flu shot in Sep2020 or Oct2020 with no problem and he gets it every year. Concomitant medications included olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide 40 mg/25mg tablets from 2019 and ongoing for blood pressure; amlodipine from 2019 and ongoing for blood pressure abnormal; oxybutynin for incontinence (&#34;to control his bladder so that he does not have to go&#34;), from an unknown date, almost one year before this report (2020) and ongoing; colchicine (COLCRYS) (not actually taking it as he is out of it), from the middle of Feb2021 for gout; allopurinol from the middle of Feb2021 and ongoing for gout; calcium carbonate (ACID BREAKTHROUGH FORMULA) for antacid therapy, from an unknown date and ongoing (&#34;has been taking it on and off for 20 years&#34;); ibuprofen, taking on and off for the last 5 years (now ongoing) for pain, from an unknown date; ascorbic acid (VITAMIN C ACID) from an unknown date (has been on at least the last 4 years) for cold or flu prophylaxis; ongoing fish oil (has been on for the last 2 or 3 years) for blood cholesterol (he was told it was supposed to help cholesterol), from an unknown date and metformin for pre-diabetes (&#34;his numbers are very low, but they told him to take it so that he does not get diabetes&#34;), from an unknown date (has been on it for about a year and a half). Past drug history included oxycodone-acetaminophen, which was last filled on 03Oct2011. In Mar2021, two weeks after the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine he did not feel the best: he felt fine the first week, but then, on &#34;Sunday&#34; [21Mar2021] the patient felt like he might be getting the flu, he experienced pain in stomach, stating that the pain is there but it does not hurt that bad, headache, defined as &#34;not that bad, just a mild headache; it is about the same, it is an annoying ache&#34;, and anything he eats turns to acid. The events didn&#39;t require ED or physician office visit. The patient added that there is a problem with his leg where it is oozing, started two years before this report, and they are going to give him antibiotics, cephalexin 500 mg capsule. His second vaccine dose is planned on 31Mar2021 and he is afraid that antibiotics could interfere with the vaccine efficacy. The patient didn&#39;t receive any treatment, as he thought that this would just go away in 2 to 3 days. At the time of the report the stomach pain was ongoing (&#34;it goes and comes&#34;), as well as the event &#34;anything he eats turns to acid&#34;; the outcome of the other events was unknown.

He felt like a panic attack, and felt uneasy driving.  He got home and sat for a while and noticed that his body was getting sore, and felt like he had the COVID virus and felt fatigued, joint pain that was worsening.  He did not have a fever and then had diarrhea and vomiting that lasted for a week.  He called an center after he talked to his doctor the first time, and they told him that he had to hang in there as 20-25% of their patient&#39;s were from the vaccine and that it would go away in a couple of weeks or so.   He possibly was exposed to COVID from somebody working in his house.   He took Ibuprofen for pain and soreness.  He is still having the fatigue and brain fog and sometimes can&#39;t get his words together.  He works part-time and is not able to do so at this point as a substitute teacher.    The symptoms are getting better, but he is still not back to his normal self.    He has lost a lot of coordination at this time, was an athlete and gets out of breathe walking 50 yards to his mailbox.

                                                Within an hour of receiving 2nd dose started experiencing headaches and dizziness. In addition to the headaches and severe dizziness I started having significant bouts with diarrhea, malaise, loss of appetite and have not slept well.  Within a couple days I noticed pronounced tremors in my right hand and I started losing weight from 180 pounds to 157, around 23 pound loss.  I contacted my physician and was alerted to make this report and have an appointment on March 1.

Headache, diarrhea, lost of balance, dizziness, and confused. Lasted about 24 hours. I though I had Covid again. 48 hours later I feel much better except my body feels like a truck hit me and  no energy.

As days progressed the pain worsened as well as the fatigue.  After the second vaccine (booster) he became lightheaded and dizzy.  Passed out at least once.  Needed help with shower.  Dizziness comes and goes, but is active more than inactive.  Appetite is small.

Continued vertigo, but no nausea, for the rest of that day.  Vertigo symptoms have continued, but eased considerably from severity at onset.

Condition is not severe enough at this point to inhibit any activities, but is still present.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was administered on March 11th 2021 at Walgreens Pharmacy, Pfizer Lot number EN6199. The side effects from this dose were mild nausea, shakes, chills, dizzy, somewhat disoriented and &#34;foggy&#34; brain. These disappeared the next day. My second dose was on April 1st. at the same facility. This time I had no reaction. On the morning on April 11th I woke up feeling miserable. The symptoms were identical to the side effects of the first dose, except worse. This time I also had a low grade fever. These symptoms dissipated in 36 hours. On April 13th I woke up to the same symptoms again, though milder, lasting about 8 hours. Today, April 21st,, I woke up with the symptoms one more time, lasting about 5 hours. As I am writing this I feel fine again. As a lay person I have no idea if these are all related. The whole scenario  seems rather odd to me. For your information, I had my yearly physical in late March 2021, all tests were normal.

In the night, had frequently interrupted sleep, chills, body aches, mild nausea.  The following day, tired all day; last night, had chills, felt abnormally warm, had reduced appetite.   Took Ibuprofin around 11:00 p.m.  Felt better.   In repeated thermometer readings, highest temp was 98.6, is normally in 97-range.  Had some chills and sweating which interrupted sleep a bit, but slept better than the previous night.  Still feeling a little tired today, but overall feeling better.

A 68-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198) on 26Feb2021, and the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN6208) in arm on 19Mar2021 , both at the age of 68 years old at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received flu vaccine in Oct2020 or Nov2020. The patient had his first dose of BNT162B2 on 26Feb2021 and about 4 days later he had stomach pain on 02Mar2021. It lasted about 2 or 3 days then the stomach pain let up. The patient thought the stomach pain was over. Then the patient received his second dose of BNT162B2 and in about the same amount of time after receiving BNT162B2, the stomach pain came back. On Mar2021, the pain was so bad he couldn&#39;t stand up. The patient went to the doctor and he was given 4 ground up Aspirin to take. The patient screamed when the doctor pressed on one spot of his stomach. The patient was taken to the x-ray room and his stomach was x-rayed. He was asked where the pain was and when the doctor pushed on that spot, his back arched up in the air because it hurt. The x-ray showed he had a big black spot in his stomach and the doctor told him it was a blood clot. The doctor on call said it was a blood clot and his regular doctor told him it was a blood clot. The doctor&#39;s determined the blood clot was from BNT162B2 because the blood clot happened right after he received the vaccine. Besides his regular doctor who is listed in the formal field, he also saw another doctor when he went in that day with the stomach pain. He was told his regular doctor was busy and he had to see another doctor. The patient didn&#39;t have any blood drawn at the doctor just the x-ray of his stomach. The doctor said he had a blood clot, a black spot, about the size of a silver dollar in his stomach. The doctor clamped her index finger and thumb together in a circle to show him how big the black spot was. The x-ray technician and two doctors told him it was a blood clot. He had the 4 aspirin ground up and the doctor told him the aspirin got rid of the blood clot. He also took some pills for 2 to 3 days but he can&#39;t recall the name of the pills. He says the x-ray tech zeroed in on the spot that was causing him pain in his stomach. The outcome of events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Considering the temporal association, a causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of blood clot cannot be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 68-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: ER8730), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 24Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included occasional headache. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took aspirin. Historical vaccine of the patient included the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection; Lot number: EN6202) via an unspecified route of administration (at 68-year-old) on 24Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunization. On an unknown date in Mar2021 patient had diarrhea since his second shot and all the tests his doctor performed had come back negative. He mentioned that diarrhea was a side effect of this vaccine and he was wondering if you have a cure for this or was this now his life. There was a couple other issues that had come up around that same time (Mar2021) and he was unsure if they were related and he had not talked to his doctor about them yet because he had been more concerned with the diarrhea but sometimes when he was eating, food seemed to get stuck in his throat and then it was hard to swallow so he tried to drink and then it was like his mouth does not work right and his lips would not close and water spills out. On 28May2021 the patient reported that it was actually a very bad day. He mentioned that diarrhea was persistent for 4 weeks and then it almost went away for a week or two and now was back and bad as ever. The outcome of events was not recovered.

Some shortness of breath.  Patient saw me a few days later feeling like he was dying.  He was treated with steroids and vitamin C along with glutathione IV treatment.  Started to feel better the next day.  A week later, felt nearly back to normal.

                                                Extreme diarhea, gas, and lower back pain beginning about 10:30 PM the day after receiving  the vaccine injection. The pain is centered in the area of the surgeries (L3- L5) There was no discomfort at the injection site after the injection. There was no significant physical activity or strain, and no extraordinary dietary changes prior to the reactions. the injection may not be the cause of pain and diarhea, but some of the possible reactions include &#34;..muscle pain.. and feeling unwell&#34;. My primary concerns are: 1) Will the back pain subside?  It is less now, and I hope it will return to normal in time.  2) Should I take any additional injections of the vaccine?

My wife called 911 and I was transported by ambulance to the ER at Hospital. While enroute I was given epinephrine and Benadryl. I was admitted to the hospital overnight for observation.  On February 4th I was evaluated by an allergy specialist who ordered a RAST blood test for food allergies since I had eaten shrimp that day.  Tests for all food allergies were negative.

                                                Not sure if delayed reaction because it was a week out.  Symptoms included delayed injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, 99.2 temp, injection site red (delayed and only on 7th day), nausea, feeling unwell, dizziness, weakness, and hives which were relieved with Benedryl.    Most of the symptoms began on Monday, February 8th and worsened on Tuesday, February 9th with hives.  There was no shortness of breath or respiratory issues.  Injection site was only tender on day of injection but tender and red on the 9th only.  Fatigue, headache,  hives continued on February 10th along with a slight bout of diarrhea.  Called clinic and they requested he go in and be tested for Covid-19 and results should be known in 2 days.  February 11th seemed to be better and as of 10:00 a.m. PST no hives but still itching and slight fatigue.  Again,  didn&#39;t know if it could be a reaction since it is a week out or something else.

The patient experienced  muscle and joint pain, fever, severe chills, severe shivering, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, severe headache, injection site pain and a severe feeling of sickness. This severe feeling of sickness was the worst feeling of sickness that I have had in my life, only equal to the most sick I have felt in my life, which was the last time I had the flu, which was almost 43 years ago. This began about 9 hours after I got my second vaccine shot. This lasted about 36 hours, the worst of it about 4 hours. Lab data sars-cov-2 test (unknown date): negative. No treatment received. Events were reported as non-serious. Outcome of the events was recovered.

                                                Patient was in to receive his second dose of the COVID vaccine. He reported no known issues after his first dose and remained in the pharmacy for the recommended 15 minute observation period following the vaccine without any problems. He reported to us today that around 45 minutes after having received the vaccine, he started to have a choking episode, something that he commonly experiences with his Parkinson&#39;s Disease, so he and his wife didn&#39;t think much of it. This seemed to evolve into nausea and dry heaves with excess mucus production that lasted for hours. Because of the duration, they decided to contact his insurance company&#39;s nurse line who recommended he go to the Emergency Department to rule out COVID and pneumonia  He was admitted to the ED and ultimately found to be negative for both COVID and pneumonia, at which point they decided that his Parkinson&#39;s exacerbation might have been the result of having received the vaccine. He has since been discharged and is doing well.

                                                Headache, feverish, chills, sick feeling with fatigue.  Slept much of day.  Didn&#39;t feel like doing anything.  Loss of appetite. Feeling of unease in my stomach.  Was nauseous right before bedtime.  Next day (on the 27th) I felt much better in the morning.  Didn&#39;t have the sick feeling.  Didn&#39;t seem to have the headache.  Had some appetite again.  So, I had a really bad day the day after the vaccination.

Things were better, I could move around and back to normal by 2 pm.

Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid, ascorbic acid (ASPIRIN [ACETYLSALICYLIC ACID;ASCORBIC ACID]) taken for cardiac disorder; atorvastatin (ATORVASTATIN) taken for blood cholesterol abnormal; amlodipine (AMLODIPINE) taken for blood pressure abnormal and multivitamins. The first shot knocked him on his butt. He slept for two weeks then he started to pass blood clots in his urine. He read that the vaccine can cause clotting and he doesn&#39;t know if that might have caused the clots right after the shot. He just needs someone to hold his hand about getting the second shot. He has to leave in a couple of hours to get it. He was asking do we see a pattern where people have had a bad first reaction with the first shot and they don&#39;t have a bad a reaction the second time around. He clarified he received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on 18Feb2021 at 1600 in the right arm. He was fine until Saturday (20Feb2021) when he woke up nauseous; really tired; could not get out of bed; and then really didn&#39;t do anything for two weeks. He added he couldn&#39;t stay awake even sitting up in his chair. He couldn&#39;t eat anything because the sight or smell of food made him gag, even in the grocery store. He added he also noticed he started to get the blood clots in his urine the second day after the shot (20Feb2021). On 19Feb2021, he mentioned he had a bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and he usually does not bruise. He stated he felt like he had all the symptoms of COVID. All of these symptoms lasted two weeks. When he finally felt better the only thing he wanted to eat was a burger and fries. He is still bleeding but it is not clotting anymore. The clots only lasted about a week. He also thought he was having a heart attack, but was too tired to go to the hospital. After speaking to his physician/specialist, they encouraged him to go ahead and get the 2nd dose. The patient  would like to know whether the benefits outweigh the risks for him to receive the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine based on his medical history. The patient would like to know whether one dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine provides some protection. The patient was asking whether he might die from receiving the 2nd dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The outcome of the events heart attack was unknown; events bruise on his arm about the size of a half dollar where he got the shot and blood clot in urine was recovered on 27Feb2021 while other events were recovered on 06Mar2021.

                                                The patient is a poor historian and history is obtained from him and his partner.  His symptoms have started yesterday after receiving the second dose of a Covid vaccine.  The couple went to eat a meal of Chinese food, and that evening the patient developed persistent nausea and vomiting.  He had multiple episodes of emesis.  According to his partner, he continued to have episodes of emesis this morning.  The emesis was nonbilious and nonbloody, described as watery.    The patient says he woke up this morning and may have felt some palpitations.  He thinks the palpitations may have been worse than usual.  He says he generally just felt unwell.  He could not get out of bed and move around very much due to the nausea and vomiting.  He says that for this reason, he activated EMS who brought him to the hospital.  Regarding his atrial fibrillation, he says he is mostly compliant with taking his medications, however he did not take any of his home medications today.In the ER, he was hypertensive to 141/111 and tachycardic to 141, tachypneic to 23.  His heart rate went up to the 170s and he was given multiple doses of IV metoprolol.  On labs, he had a leukocytosis with a white blood count of 12 and the D-dimer was elevated greater than 20.  CTA was obtained to rule out pulmonary embolism which was negative.  However, down in the scanner he developed an episode of unresponsiveness with questionable seizure symptoms.  He was treated with an LR bolus 500 cc but due to the findings of increased pulmonary vascular congestion, was diuresed with Lasix 80 mg IV x1.  Blood cultures x2 were obtained.

                                                I was hospitalized 2Xs immediately after receiving the 2nd Covid-19 vaccination for coronary artery blockages: 3/19 and again 3/22. I had been experiencing what I thought was heartburn and was referred to by PCP to a cardiologist who ordered a stress test that I passed. After suffering severe pain in my sternum from 11:00 pm 3/18-1:00 am 3/19 I went to the hospital. An EKG showed no coronary issues yet at 7 am I was taken to the cardiac catheter lab where it was discovered i had a 100% blockage. A stent was implanted and i was released around 4:30 pm the afternoon of 3/20. The morning of 3/22 I once again experienced severe chest pain and called an ambulance. I was told by the EMT my heart rate reached more than 200. I was rushed back to the same hospital where a 2nd cardiac catheter was performed. It was discovered that the stent implanted 48 hours earlier had a 100% blockage. It was opened and several additional stents were implanted. I was kept in the ICU for 2 days for observation and then released. No one I&#39;ve spoken with since can verify what caused the 2nd episode. Several people at the hospital speculated the cause for the 2nd attack may have been a single dose of Brilinta that had been missed Saturday evening because by the time my wife got me home from the hospital and settled our pharmacy was closed. She picked up my prescriptions first thing Sunday morning and I took everything as directed. My cardiologist agreed with  me that missing 1 dose should not have caused such an adverse reaction.

A 69-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 13Apr2021 (Lot Number: EW0158) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient had no covid prior vaccination. Concomitant medications included acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN EC); atorvastatin (LIPITOR [ATORVASTATIN]); carvedilol (COREG); fluocinonide (LIDEX-E); sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate (ENTRESTO); and warfarin sodium (COUMADIN). The patient had nausea, vomiting and diarrhea since getting the vaccine which progressed to a large GI bleed, had PEA (Pulseless electrical activity), was resuscitated and was currently in the ICU intubated. The events occurred on 14Apr2021 and all events resulted in hospitalization, considered as life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). The patient received treatment for the events which included transfusions, resuscitation, and current intubation. The patient underwent lab test which included Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay: negative on 19Apr2021. Outcome of the events was not recovered.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The causal relationship between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completely excluded considering the temporal association.

A 69-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0171), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 01May2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included pulmonary embolism shower, cholesterol and arthritis. Concomitant medication(s) included rivaroxaban (XARELTO) 10 mg 1x/day taken for pulmonary embolism from 2013 and ongoing; simvastatin 40 mg 1x/day taken for &#34;to keep my cholesterol under control&#34; from 2010 and ongoing and oxycodone hydrochloride, oxycodone terephthalate, paracetamol (PERCOCET) taken for Arthritis (and because of the blood thinners he could not take any other NSAIDs) from 2013 (started taking it right around time he got on blood thinners) and ongoing, 325 mg/5mg, 2 pills a day, sometimes less and sometimes more depending on his pain levels. The patient previously took the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EW0153), administered in right arm on 01Apr2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization and Zithromycin topical. The patient neither receive any other vaccines on same date of the Pfizer suspect nor within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. The patient reported that he had COVID like symptoms after getting his second shot and was taking prednisone along with the shot after going to urgent care for poison ivy. The patient wanted to know if this would be an adverse event. The caller was also taking Zithromycin topical. On 05May2021, 4 days after the vaccination, he went to urgent care where he was told he had poison ivy. Urgent care started him on Doxycycline and Prednisone. The prednisone was tapered from 60mg for 4 days, 40mg for 4 days and 10mg for 4 days. A week ago (Saturday), his niece visited him and they hugged and stuff. The patient&#39;s niece was not vaccinated. They sat outside. On 27May2021, the patient started feeling very tired, his stomach was upset and was very nauseated. The patient further reported that he was doing yard work a week ago this past Thursday and he thought he didn&#39;t feel right so he took shower and laid on couch in the dark all day. He stated that his stomach was nauseous, he felt out of sorts, he was flipping and flopping. That night he went to bed and woke up with a really bad headache to the point of where he thought of taking pain medication for the headache. He never had a fever. The patient did not want to take any COVID tests if it were to come back positive because he heard about the baseball players getting the Johnson and Johnson shot and having COVID and not having any symptoms and one of them had symptoms, but it only lasting for a day or two. The patient&#39;s brother-in-law and sister, who he lives with, also received the vaccines and were fully vaccinated at the time of his nieces visit and were in close proximity to niece. They didn&#39;t had any effects from hugging her so that was why he thought maybe it was related to him taking prednisone. The patient did not require a visit to emergency room but required an urgent care for poison ivy. There was no family medical history relevant to events other than brother-in-law and sister-in-law didn&#39;t have any side effects after hugging niece. The patient did not undergo relevant tests. The outcome of the event stomach nauseous, feeling abnormal and really bad headache was resolved on 28May2021; while Poison Ivy, very tired and stomach was upset was unknown. The patient thought his symptoms (stomach nauseous, felt out of sorts/ didn&#39;t feel right/ flipping and flopping, really bad headache, very tired and stomach was upset) maybe related to the Prednisone.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

This consumer reported for a patient. A 69-year-old male patient (age at vaccination: 69 year) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0172 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, in Arm Left, on 10Jun2021 at 12:30, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included blood pressure, cholesterol, ongoing pulmonary issues, he had Covid, and residual problems. Concomitant medications were not reported. historical vaccine included first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EW0172 and expiry date was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 21May2021, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient took Covid-19 Vaccine because he had a 98-year-old father and would like to see him. The patient had chills, shivering, muscle aches, nausea on 10Jun2021, and he slept all day on 11Jun2021. Saturday night he started to feel better. He was laid up from Thursday night until Saturday. He was in bed for almost 20 hours shivering. He was feeling better. He had Covid antibodies too. He needed to see people, and in order to see people he would only be embraced if he was vaccinated so he got the vaccine in order to be social. He was in bed freezing and sleeping. He had pretty heavy-duty arm pain and couldn&#39;t lift his arm over his ears. He started to complain of arm pain probably within 2 hours of the injection, and as more time passed the worse it got. At first it was like his arm was killing him, then he could barely lift his arm. By Thursday night he was shivering. In Arizona it was in the triple digits. He had 2 blankets, a comforter, and a sheet under than on him and he was shivering to the point where she had to lay on him to keep him warm. That lasted all night long and was just miserable. Then he got up for 5 or 10 minutes on Friday, then he was in bed the entire day until Saturday. It was unbelievable. They were so busy being sick they couldn&#39;t help each other. He looked pretty good by Saturday mid-morning at like 11:00 or so. The patient couldn&#39;t eat while was sick. On Saturday he made a cup of tea, toast, and an English muffin. He was definitely feeling better Saturday morning, and by Saturday afternoon he was pretty much himself. He was under a pulmonologist&#39;s care. He was seen by infection disease initially then he was put under the pulmonologist&#39;s care. He had X-rays to see how his lungs were doing, and they worked in conjugation with his primary physician. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Follow up attempts are possible further information is expected.

Patient with complicated medical history including stage 1B pancreatic cancer (was currently on chemotherapy mFOLFIRINOX), and a leadless permanent pacemaker implantation on 1-11-21 for long episodes of SR with complete heart block following symptoms of syncope (other cardiac history: CAD s/p CABG 2009, PAF, and HTN). Regarding ER visit for epigastric pain, nothing notable was found on workup and patient was to discharge home to rest. There were available doses of COVID-19 Vaccine following a vaccine clinic that same day, and patient was offered and agreed to a dose of vaccine. Patient was monitored for 15 minutes post vaccine with no notable issues. The following day, Monday 1-18-21, patient&#39;s caregiver called facility at 22:30 to report he had a fever of 102.8 degrees and that he had been &#34;feeling kind of bad all day&#34;. Patient was advise to seek urgent medical care and reported back to ED on 1-19-21 at 00:55. Patient wasd admitted for SIRS (tachycardia and febrile) -- patient also reported diffuse myalgia. WBC WNL, CXR unremarkable for infection, UA neg for bacteria, LFTs WNL, blood cultures negative. Procalcitonin elevated at 17.8 -- suggesting inflammatory response. Patient initially reported feeling better on the morning of 1-19-21, but around 13:00 began rapidly declining (confusion, unable to walk) and started experiencing EKG changes (9 beats of SVT). Patient then coded and resuscitation was attempted for approximately 30 minutes. Patient did not survive the code. Coroner has been notified and family is considering autopsy at time of this report.

                                                Vertigo -- intermittent, associated with head movement. Suddenly turning or changing the orientation of my head results in vertigo for several seconds. I experienced nausea for a few minutes after getting out of bed this morning.  I developed the same symptoms (but much milder) 8 days after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine on Dec. 23 (the morning of Dec. 31). Those symptoms mostly occurred when I went from supine or prone to any other position (eg, rolling over). They resolved after about 1 week. I did not report those symptoms because I didn&#39;t associate them with the vaccine. That vaccine was Lot # EH9899.

                                                Got shot at 8am 22 Jan. Slight soreness in arm developed later the same day, but no problem. Everything was normal and went to bed. Woke up approximately 2-3 h later with extreme vertigo, dizziness, imbalance, completely clogged left ear, tinnitus in left hear and nausea. Within about an hour I was hyperventilating and had cold tingling sensation in hands and feet. About 2am went to hospital. They did a bunch of tests including a CT scan which revealed nothing adverse. They kept me over night and gave me an MRI the next morning. Again nothing adverse found. I was released that next day with orders to see PCP. Got an appt 2 days later. PCP immediately started me on Prednisone and referred me to ENT doctor. Got an audio test 2 days later and because of the severity of my symptoms (sudden, acute tinnitus and complete hearing loss in left ear) ENT prescribed higher dose and duration of prednisone. I am on day 5 of the 24day course prescribed by ENT with no appreciable improvement. Still have no hearing in left ear and tinnitus, imbalance and trouble focusing and walking.  No causal link has been ascribed to the vaccine, but I am terrified of having the booster shot which is schedule for 12 Feb.

                                                I was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 13 March, 2020.  After getting my first injection I was fine all that day. The next I experienced headache and significant aches in my joints along with a general feeling of being ill as has been been reported.  After my second dose the headaches and joint pains began within a few hours.  I also had significant diaherra that lasted most of the day of the shot and into the next morning.  At first I thought the diaherra may have been from cheese I ate the night before but that has never lasted like this.

By 10:30pm was shivering with temperature of 101 fahrenheit, headache, sinus congestion with clear liquid running out of nose and nausea. Took two acetaminophen at 11:00 pm. About two hours later, nose stopped running and just had nasal drip. Could not sleep. At 3:30 am  (Tuesday morning) nausea subsided. At 10:00 a,m Tuesday still in bed but felt better. Checked temperature and still 101. Continued to take acetaminophen every six hours as recommended. Checked temperature  in the afternnon and it was 99. Checked temperature again at 9:00 pm before going to bed  and it was exactly 98.6.  Decided not to take more acetaminophen. Got up around 3:00 am (Wednesday morning) to use restroom and  checked temperature. It was 100.2. Took two acetaminophen and went to bed. That was the last time I registered an elevated temperature. Still feel weak and tired six days later.

                                                On January 28 around 9 am, I started feeling sick. About an hour later, I felt nauseated and then started vomiting. I vomited throughout the day, about 6 times. I assumed this was a fairly common reaction to the vaccine.  The following day (Jan. 29) I felt very weak and noticed that when I signed my name, my hand felt numb and I couldn&#39;t control it very well. On Saturday, my left leg began to feel abnormal.  I called a friend who is a retired doctor and he said that he had heard of some neurological reactions to the vaccine. By Sunday, I was having a difficult time walking so I called my GPs office and set up an appointment for Monday morning.  As soon as she saw my face without a mask, she said that I had had a stroke.  I had a slight droop on my left cheek and mouth which indicated to the doctor that a stroke had occurred. She scheduled me for a MRI the following morning, Feb. 3. As soon as the MRI was completed, my GP scheduled me with a neurosurgeon whom I was able to see the same afternoon. The diagnosis was a right medullary ischemic stroke. She ordered a number of tests to be run and scheduled me for March 9 to come back for the result of all the tests and blood work. Doctor referred me for physical therapy to help me regain the use of my left leg and hand.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) lot number EL9264 and expiry date unknown, via unspecified route of administration at the right arm on 29Jan2021 11:30 at single dose for Covid-19 immunization in a clinic (vaccination clinic at county government center) and not received in a military facility. Medical history included ongoing borderline diabetic (watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago), overweight (probably 10 lbs), cholesterol (abnormal), diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic/chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity which was probably 10 lbs overweight. The patient was told that he has borderline diabetic watch what he eats and do a little exercise and stuff couple years ago. Concomitant medication included pravastatin from Aug2020 and ongoing for cholesterol. The patient did not receive other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the administration date of the suspect vaccine. On 29Jan2021 after the vaccine was administered, the patient was real tired, kind of felt weak and right arm was sore which he expected. The patient went to bed early about 20:30 and slept solid until 30Jan2021 07:00; like he did not know anything was going on while he slept. On 30Jan2021, he got up and he wasn&#39;t really tired, but he was really kind of numb, like he could not get his faculties together. The patient informed that after about 3 cups of coffee later that day on 30Jan2021, he got kind of sick in afternoon. The patient was really tired, had chills, thinks he had a light or mild fever, was sweating, had some pretty good stomach cramps that felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t which lasted about 4 hours (30Jan2021). The patient&#39;s face did feel flushed a little bit on 30Jan2021. The patient thought he would have to go to the hospital for a time, but he waited it out and got better. The patient went to bed again early that day. On 31Jan2021, the patient felt better, but again not a lot of energy (pending clarification, also reported date 30-MAR-1871) probably because he had not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine on 29Jan2021. The patient still has a little lack of energy yet, but that could be because he did not eat a whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine. The patient informed that he had no swelling in his arm or anything, he was thinking that he survived. The patient was back to feeling pretty good again today. The patient thought that the vaccine was going to work. The events did not require emergency room/physician visit. The patient did not provide information with the primary/prescriber. The patient&#39;s second dose was on 19Feb2021. The outcome of the events stomach cramps, felt like he had to throw up and couldn&#39;t was recovered on 30Jan2021, not a lot of energy/little lack of energy, not been eating a lot since he got the vaccine/whole lot for that day and a half after the vaccine was recovering, while unknown for the rest of the events.

A 70-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 11Feb2021 15:00 (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included depression, diabetes, arterial sclerosis, panic attacks, high cholesterol/ blood pressure, and enlarged prostate. The patient had no knpown allergies. Concomitant medications included clopidogrel bisulfate (CLOPIDROGEL SANDOZ); clonazepam; tamsulosin; and ramipril. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL3247) via an unspecified route of administration administered in right arm on 21Jan2021 at 4:00 PM (at the age of 70-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Soon after the 2nd shot in Feb2021, the patient started having headaches, tiredness, muscle/joint aches. Three (3) days after it on unspecified date in Feb2021, he started having dizziness, panic attacks, visual blurriness, and his depression got worse. This last week on unspecified date in Feb2021, the dizziness with nausea, the visual disturbances increased to the point where the patient fell once, almost fell at least 5 times but caught himself, panic attacks increased, and on unspecified date in 2021 (also reported as yesterday) the patient had what was almost like a visual hallucination while riding in the car. Still dizzy today. His blood pressure has been elevated on unspecified date in 2021- most likely due to the worry about all of this. He does not know if these are related to the shot or something different is going on. There was no treatment for the adverse events. The events required physician office visit. No COVID prior vaccination and was not tested wih COVID post vaccination. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

                                                Got the vaccine, had no reactions.  Then about 4 days later he was going for a 2 mile walk and started out on the walk and had not done a 1/4 of a mile and he started to feel warm.  He had pain in his trapezius muscles into his neck, had a headache and had a bad pain in the pit of his stomach, joint pain in his knees and started to get vasovagal event, everything looked bright and the white things seemed to glow.  He then walked back to his vehicle slowly.  Since then every time he does anything exertionally, walking for any short distance the same symptoms seem to come on.  He also has a tired feeling.  He called his cardiologist and he suggested that he should try drinking a lot of water to hydrate himself.  His brother-in-law is a paramedic who also told him to hydrate before his vaccine.   He&#39;s been drinking a lot of water.  He does have a stomach issue, and has been having the nausea but believes that was preexistent to the vaccine.  He has not had any reactions around the injection site itself.  He did have some soreness in the arm for a couple of days initially, but had also gotten a regular flu vaccine through the hospital and had the same reaction with that.

                                                I received my shot at 10 in the morning on April 8th the I felt pretty good when I got home just a little soreness in my arm but at 3 in the morning I awakened to chills 101.3 fever and feelings of   nauseous in this and very thirsty I laid in bed. I am a dialysis patient I had dialysis schedule for 10 the next morning but I didn&#39;t feel well enough to go so they gave me a time later on in the day which by that time I felt good. I was able to drive there and I was good so when I got done with dialysis I could not walk I was too weak to do anyting I had to have my daughter come and get me and drive me home. That had to be a reaction between the injection and the diabetes treatment when does dialysis treatment I&#39;m sorry but yeah then I felt bad the whole rest of the day and I didn&#39;t feel good again until the next morning which is now.

On march 28th still diarrhea but after lunch felt ill and progressively got worse then at 4:00 PM vomitting started and it wouldn&#39;t stop and after 5 hours went to emergency room at PVH.  They recommended I stay for a variety of blood, stool , virus tests.  Admitted for 2 nights, no tests confirmed anything.  It is my opinion this was from the COVID shot interacting with y compromised immune system-Doctors can&#39;t conclude this.

Transfered on 3/13 to the facility. Noted increased SOB without CP, palpitations, cough, orthopnea or PND. No history of home O2 use but required 2-3L O2 during this hospital stay. Was noted on admit to Facility to have troponin elevation with unchanged EKG. Was started on NSTEMI protocol with heparin ggt, ASA, BB, and statin. Initially received one dose ceftriaxone/azithro for possible PNA. On admission, primary team held home BB. On arrival to Facility, troponin at 3.998 trended to 4.442 and then trended down. underwent CTA to evaluate for PE that was negative. CXR and CT showed pulmonary edema consistent with HF exacerbation and a proBNP 8613. Patient was given 40mg IV lasix x2. RRT was called twice, once for BP 80/50 treated with 500ml IVF, and second for CP that resolved with NTG and tramadol. Cardiology was consulted with goal to cath patient, however some concern for medication adherence going forward so they will reevaluate. Patient began to have tachycardia with rates in the 150s sustained and hypotension. EKG showed likely sinus tachycardia with wide QRS similar to prior EKGs. Patient has ICD in place that was interrogated and showed good function. IV metoprolol 5mg given x3 with rated decrease to upper 120s. Patient remained asymptomatic, awake, and alert. Per discussion with wife after transfer, patient BP has been in the 50s systolic at home for the last month. Cardiac cath was performed showing 99% stenosis of LCX. Did not tolerate procedure with nausea, vomiting, and altered mental status. RRT was called after cath procedure. He is nauseous, diaphoretic. He complained of chest pressure. STAT EKG obtained. Noted ST depressions in the septal leads significant from before. Cardiology concerned pt was having an inferior MI.

Patient had slight delirium and was not acting like himself. He underwent lab test included respiratory rate (RR) greater than or equal to 30 breaths per minute, heart rate (HR) greater than or equal 125 beats per minute, use of vasopressors to maintain BP, SpO2 less than or equal 93% on room air, PaO2/FiO2 less than 300 mm Hg on an unknown date, dialysis, chest X-ray showed bilateral fluffy infiltrates, covid test positive, CT scan had classic ground glass look for covid, CT of chest w/ contrast and no embolism, white cell count 6.2, hemogolbin 11.2, hemocrit 34.6%, platelet 110, sodium133, blood urea (BUN) 38, creatinine 3.7, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 1962, troponin 0.125, albumin 2.9, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 49, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 27, Pulse O2 low at 90 on 05Apr2021 and blood immunoglobulin G, blood immunoglobulin M (IgM /IgG) had unofficial result as a titer of 1 on 06Apr2021. He displays clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness. He came in slightly tachycardic about 120 bpm. Hypotension caused by hospital pulling too much fluid not by disease. No mechanical ventilation needed. Patient required oxygen because O2 saturation was at 90. Required 2-3 liters of oxygen initially and next day graduated to high flow. He was complaining of severe GI distress. Sonogram was negative. CT scan scheduled for tonight. He was on anticoagulation from prior DVT. Patient received treatment with remdesivir for COVID-19 and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, azithromycin, corticosteroids, decadron steroid for other events. No immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. Adverse events were resulted in emergency room, hospitalization and admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. The outcome of event COVID pneumonia was not recovered, whereas unknown for all other events.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the events.

Follow-up (17Feb2021) was received from same reporter and processed together with initial information.   A 70-year-old male patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) via unspecified route of administration on 13Feb2021 02:30 (at the age of 70-years) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE in arm left for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes, heart condition, blood cholesterol, stomach discomfort. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included Metformin for diabetes mellitus, Rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol, Chlorthalidone, Losartan, Clopidogrel bisulfate, Aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid], Pantoprazole for abdominal discomfort, Magnesium oxide for cardiac disorder (all were ongoing). The patient got the second vaccine on 13Feb2021 at 02:30 and felt absolutely fine. The patient went to bed at 10:30 which is pretty typical, the patient got up to go to the bathroom and realized that he was walking really funny. The patient don&#39;t have a long walk to bathroom, it just came upon him that he was just walking very fine like his legs were going higher than normal (feet going too high) and kind of falling back down and this was very weird state. The patient thought on that, &#34;it seem to be a neurological symptom&#34;. The next day, the patient was just exhausted. The patient came down and laid on the couch and the patient literally could not get his muscles to move properly to get off the couch, the patient just couldn&#39;t do it, and patient&#39;s wife had to pick him up. The patient stated he was very capable and so for him to be immobilized like that was strange. The patient kept trying to figure out why, why can&#39;t he get off this couch. So, that night and the patient slept all day basically and that night the patient slept great. Following day, the patient got up and was still tired and the patient did manage to finally take a shower which he was wanting to do, which worked in the right direction for the patient. The patient also had a rash in his entire torso, thighs, sides and back. The patient stated two things one was that &#34;nerve seemingly neurological thing&#34; and another was that the patient&#39;s total upper body had rash and on torso sides and back. The patient denied having rash on arm. The patient had gold tooth and it just started hurting crazy and then after that his mouth was full of like little sores something like that. The patient was able to get rid of them using warm salt water. The patient had lost about 5 pounds. The patient also had headache and fever and he was taking ibuprofen for it. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I had problems over the years with my prostate. After the vaccine I had been urinating every hour with little output. I had to be catharize because of urinary obstruction, which means my bladder was not releasing urine. Extreme pressure in my abdomen because the is no urine output. The condition has persists, I now have to self catharize daily. Which has prompted me to have prostate surgery this coming Friday 06/11/2021.

A 70-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: EL9261, Expiration date: Unknown), via an unspecified route, administered in Right Arm on 27Jan2021 09:30 AM (at an age of 70-year-old during vaccination) as a 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included hand pain, Diabetes, Sleep disorder, Iron deficiency, Blood pressure abnormal and blood thinner condition. The patient&#39;s family history was reported as none. The patient concomitant medication included metformin taken for diabetes from a long time and ongoing, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN) taken orally for hand pain from two or three months and ongoing, lisinopril taken orally for blood pressure abnormal from a long time and ongoing, acetylsalicylic acid (ASPIRIN) taken for a long time and ongoing, atorvastatin taken for blood thinner from a long time and ongoing, cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B 12) from a long time and ongoing, ropinirole taken for sleep disorder from a long time and ongoing, ferrous sulfate taken for iron deficiency from an unspecified start date and ongoing; insulin detemir (LEVEMIR) injected to his stomach at night daily for diabetes mellitus from a long time and ongoing.

The reporter called on behalf of his father and mentioned that his father was diabetic, and he had some questions about his medicine. He wanted to know if the symptoms of his father had after getting the vaccine are related to the vaccine or to his usual medications and what was needed to be done.

                                                After my first vaccine (EK5730--on 12/26/20), I had absolutely NO reactions. The second one was quite a different matter.   14 hours after the shot, I developed shaking chills. The next day I had myalgias and arthralgias pretty much all over. It was that &#34;run over by a truck&#34; feeling of the flu. Headache, fatigue followed. Appetite was down. No fever.   Slept for many hours.   Now in my third day after the vaccine and not feeling better.   Still, I remain grateful that I was immunized and am taking the optimistic spin that this kind of intense reaction shows my immune system is responding strongly and nicely to the vaccine.  It is miserable though, particularly since the first one was so benign.   I am a family doctor (MD) and am torn between discussing this in my weekly health column which may dissuade patients, some already on the fence, from getting vaccinated. I saw the FDA info confirming higher incidence of side effects with second shot, which was definitely the case with me.

The patient&#39;s medical history included diabetes (controlled by food not by injection), coronary artery spasm (blood vessels that occasionally collapsed), glaucoma, and asthma. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included albuterol for asthma, atorvastatin (LIPITOR), glyceryl trinitrate (NITROGLYCERIN) for coronary artery spasm, and numbers of eye drops (unspecified) for glaucoma. The patient had taken the COVID-19 vaccine just not too long ago and had good number of non-serious side effects. The patient was not really concerned with these side effects that she had. On 13Jan2021, the patient had the little bit of pain from the injection site but that&#39;s common with any injection, so he did not count it, but next day the events started, and he still had some, but they were subsiding. The next events happened the next day after administration (14Jan2021). The patient had the injection site pain and the arm is still weak, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, and feeling unwell on 14Jan2021. The patient was recovering from the events.

                                                On Thursday morning, 2/11/21, about 8 hours short of a full week after the vaccination, I experienced a sudden onset of chills/severe shaking, general achiness, headache, severe fatigue and loss of appetite.   I spent the following 72 hours mostly prone in bed, taking only minimal nourishment, and drifting in and out of sleep.  Now, three days after that onset, I am feeling significantly better but am still weak, perhaps because of lack of food.

                                                I had my 1st Covid-19 vaccination shot on 2/10/21. I had some unexpected side effects. I think I am supposed to notify my doctor and you guys will generate a report to the government. Here are the circumstances: I received the vaccine on 02/10/21. It was Pfizer Lot Number EN5318. I got severe abdominal pain (lower left side below rib cage) four days later. I also had very bad lower back muscle pain (left side at waistline). This lasted all day. On day 2 the pain was down by about half and the back pain was gone. On day 3 I had only slight abdominal pain. It was completely gone by day 4.

                                                About 8 hours after injection, I began having pain on right side of back just under ribs. Pain worsened through night, causing difficult sleep. On evening of second day, pain spread to right flank and right front of abdomen, causing entire right side of abdomen to experience significant pain. It is possible this is muscular pain, but after reading the Internet, I believe it is inflammation of the gallbladder. I have never before experienced gallbladder issues. The pain is much worse than the &#34;muscle aches&#34; described as a COVID vaccine side effect. There is no fever or other significant symptoms. Today (third day) I emailed my doctor. His nurse responded that it is hard to tell if it is vaccine related, and that if it begins to resolve not to be concerned about it, but if it gets worse I should be seen by the doctor. I am taking Tylenol and applying Voltarin topically, but neither helps much.

A 71-years-old male patient received the first dose BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), lot EL3246 , unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 13:10 (at the age of 71-years old) as a SINGLE DOSE given in left arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included ongoing vertigo, ongoing dizziness, ongoing balance problems, ongoing vision problems, ongoing stomach problems, he lost 80lbs in a year, but his weight is starting to go back up. He has had bad health for the last 3 years. He goes to the doctors all the time. In fact, he just went to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) to find out what was going on. He has had dizziness quite often, so there are days where he just don&#39;t feel good but, he thinks it has something to do with his eyes. When he feels bad, he will lay down and close his eyes, and all of his problems go away. He went to see a retina specialist because of his continuing vision problems. The ENT doctor told him he can&#39;t help him. Concomitant medications included 6 different medications.  The patient experienced side effects after getting the first dose of the vaccine. He got the first dose a week ago and he said that he experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills and diarrhea. The patient experienced nausea, feeling unwell, chills in Jan2021 and diarrhea on 26Jan2021. He had his shot a week ago tomorrow. He was up all night last night with diarrhea, he was up probably up 10 times. He was supposed to go in to get his teeth pulled today, but he just can&#39;t do it. He does have some chills and nausea. He is feeling unwell. He supposed that he is dehydrated in Jan2021. The diarrhea just started last night, 26Jan2021. He got up about 6:15 this morning and that was the last time he had diarrhea. He still has nausea, but he hasn&#39;t had any other diarrhea. He has some nausea from the time to time. He doesn&#39;t have any COVID symptoms that he can tell. He is feeling unwell, and has the nausea and chills, but he does not have any fever. He hasn&#39;t had a fever and he can still smell and taste and all of that stuff. One thing he did notice after he got his COVID-19 shot was that he did not have any symptoms of any kind. He never had pain in his arm, nothing. He received the vaccine on 21Jan2021, and he never felt a thing or anything that would associate with the shot. The consumer doesn&#39;t know if what he is going through is caused by the shot or not. Outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                There were no immediate reactions during the 15 minute wait period. 45 minutes after my injection, while at a different Walgreens where my friend received a Moderna jab, I was hit with a rush of side effects. The first was a deep gripping pain in the diaphragm area, like a punch to the stomach with some dizziness.   While seated, my left leg experienced increasing pain from foot to hip.  In short order, my left foot grew completely numb and this extended up my calf to my knee. My foot became paralyzed. Rather than go through a lengthy emergency room procedure, we drove back and luckily, the numbness did not spread. The intense leg pain remained steady. Breathing labored. At my friend&#39;s house, the left foot &amp; calf numbing and paralysis finally subsided 4.5 hours after injection. At home, some numbness returned but subsided. Sat. through Wednesday, 2-28 to 3-3-21:  Weakness in left leg. Cramping of calf muscle. The chest cavity pain began to intensify. Chills arrive plus daily headaches. These start to resemble reported &#34;normal&#34; reactions minus the special situation of the left leg. Pain while deeply inhaling, exhaling or bending increasing. Fatigue - partly from poor sleep.  Thur. 3-4-21  Day 7:  Still with strong muscle or lung pain, especially upper back. Painful to pull back shoulders. Periodic sharp pain in upper left inner arm, not at injection site. Still pain with deep exhale or inhale. Tried a short walk: After 200 feet, left calf tightening up and pain increasing in both hips. A short rest would clear it but would return with exercise. Lower back pain as well but some of that is pre-existing.  Basic circle of pain around rib cage. Skin (or deeper tissue?) on my upper back still very sensitive, resembling sunburn. Produces chills when touched. Sleep still nearly impossible. No sleep aids being used.  Fatigue, some headache and chills remain. During this period, I have resorted to pain relievers only twice in order to learn the nature of the symptoms.  Fri. 3-5-21  Day 8 During this reaction period: NO fever, nausea, diarrhea, loss of taste / smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose. Headache, chills, joint &amp; ribcage pain remain. Skin hypersensitive on my upper back. Symptoms today same as on 3-4-21. Moderate morning headache. On a 1.5 mile walk, slight improvement with the left calf muscle cramping. Occasional &#34;clearing&#34; cough, small amount of clear phlegm produced.

I am concerned because it won&#39;t stop. I am drinking lots of fluids so as not to dehydrate. I will call my Doctor if it does not stop after 7 days.

A 71-year-old male patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot EL9264) on 10Feb2021 at about 19:00 (at the age of 71 years), in left deltoid, for COVID-19 immunisation. No other vaccines were given on the same day or within 4 weeks. The patient declined flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine (PNEUMOVAX), he had never had another vaccine except maybe his childhood vaccines. Medical history included rotator cuff surgery and cataract removed in 2020. The patient exercised regularly, he was healthy, he walked for miles and didn&#39;t eat any non-sense, he did not eat out, he did not smoke. The patient&#39;s mother was 100 years old and fully competent. The patient had two sisters older than him, the oldest one had hypertension the second sister did not have anything that they were aware of. The patient&#39;s father lived until he was 98 years old. The patient concomitant medications were none. The patient was told to take vitamin D 50,000 units but didn&#39;t even take them (he still had 9 of them in the bottle and they gave him 13). The patient experienced fever on 11Feb2021, renal failure on 14Feb2021, pulmonary embolus on 28Feb2021, cardiac arrest on 04Mar2021, dehydration and not eating or drinking on an unspecified date in Feb2021. These events required ER visit and were reported as serious as involved hospitalization from 14Feb2021 to 04Mar2021 and as fatal events. The patient died on 04Mar2021. Clinical course of the events included the following information. The patient received the first vaccine on 10Feb2021, the next day he developed a fever. The reporter spoke with the patient&#39;s doctor who told to give the patient paracetamol (TYLENOL) thinking the fever was from the vaccine. On 12Feb2021 and 13Feb2021, the patient&#39;s temperature was 102. Then the doctor advised to take the patient to the hospital. The patient&#39;s temperature was still 102, he was in renal failure, and they had to dialyze him. The patient was otherwise healthy, the patient&#39;s last physical was in Dec2020 and the only thing it showed was that his A1C was 5.7. The patient had no cholesterol or hypertension. The doctor advised the patient to decrease sugar and carbs because the holidays were coming up. The patient&#39;s follow up was scheduled on Mar2021. The reporter felt that the vaccine has something to do with the patient renal failure. The reporter spoke with the doctors at the hospital who didn&#39;t want to commit to anything. The reporter believed this was an adverse event. The caller mentioned that she had her vaccine before and she was fine. The patient was admitted on 14Feb2021 and by Wednesday he was not eating or drinking, he was dehydrated. The patient&#39;s admitting diagnoses was elevated temperature and ruling out COVID. The patient tested positive for Covid on 14Feb2021 (COVID-19 PCR test). The patient&#39;s temperature was 99.8 and then kept creeping up, on Saturday it was 102. The caller gave the patient Tylenol cold and flu (lot T0CL001021, expiry date Oct2021) took the edge off but in three hours the temperature was back up again. The patient never complained of pain and didn&#39;t want to take Tylenol. On 15Feb2021 the patient&#39;s numbers were getting better after the fluid challenge and then his numbers kept creeping up after that. The patient had the fever a week until they had it under control. The fever went away, it was gone for like 5 days, then it spiked again. The patient was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (ZOSYN) for like 3 or 5 days and the fever went away but then it kept getting worse. On 28Feb2021, the medical personnel thought the patient had a pulmonary emboli but because of the renal failure, they couldn&#39;t do a computerized tomography on the patient. The doctors mentioned that the patient was in renal failure and they thought they heparinized the patient and he had a blood clot who led to pulmonary embolus, cardiac arrest, and death. The patient was diagnosed with a pulmonary emboli on 28Feb2021. The patient started de-saturating and the doctors intubated and sedated him that whole time until this. Dialysis was started on 01Mar2021 and the patient received it every day except 04Mar2021. The patient&#39;s blood pressure was normal, it hardly ever went above 120. The patient was on the medical floor from 22Feb2021 to 04Mar2021. When the patient was on the medical surgical floor, he was on high flow 5 liters. After the patient started desaturating, he went to the intensive care unit and was put on a non-rebreather on 45%. The patient&#39;s highest heart rate was after intubation was 135, but the patient&#39;s blood pressure was low so they started him on some vasopressors. They did the fluid challenge on the patient and his labs were a little better than the labs kept creeping up until the doctor inserted a shiley catheter for dialysis. Respiratory: Respiratory arrest and then cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure, they intubated the patient. The reporter assumed dyspnea because the patient was intubated. Tachypnea was when the patient was in the intensive care unit already intubated. Hypoxemia, they intubated the patient so the caller guessed it was for the oxygen saturation drop. Covid pneumonia: yes. Chest x-ray showed mild pneumonia. The caller requested a follow up x-ray and the doctors said they were going to do another one but the caller is unsure if they did or when. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19: remdesivir. Other radiological investigations: unable because of the patient&#39;s kidney function. They were looking at the D dimer and BMP to come up with the embolus since the patient couldn&#39;t have the scan. ARDS: no. Cardiovascular: The patient had a heart attack on 04Mar2021. The reporter thought it was from the pulmonary embolus which led to cardiac arrest. Arrhythmia: the caller guessed so, the patient was being worked on for 10 minutes before the caller got there. The caller saw a rhythm strip which showed a flat line and then she noticed ventricular tachycardia, then a flat line. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. Gastrointestinal/Hepatic, neurological, hematological, dermatological: none. Vascular: pulmonary embolus: yes, deep vein thrombosis, limb ischemia, vasculitis: no. Renal: renal failure: yes, acute kidney injury: no. The patient was scheduled for his second vaccine dose on 03Mar2021 at 04:15 but did not receive it. Time of death was 4:15 in the afternoon on 04Mar2021. The reporter considered renal failure, fever, dehydration, not eating or drinking, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolus as fatal and related to the suspect vaccine. The outcome of the other events was unknown. Cause of death was unknown. No autopsy was performed.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on current information available, the company considered there is a possibility that all reported events are consequence of COVID-19 pneumonia on the basis of advanced age. The positive COVID-19 test occurred 4 days after the first injection of suspect vaccine BNT162B2. No complete effect can be achieved for short time interval. The COVID-19 is more likely pre-existing colonization or intercurrent condition, unrelated to suspect vaccine BNT162b2.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Renal failure; Fever; Dehydration; Not eating or drinking; Cardiac arrest; Pulmonary embolus

                                                Patient received the vaccine around 10 am on 3-10-21. He mentioned to the vaccinator that he had a large anxiety of needles. After receiving the vaccine the patient went to the recovery area for the required 15 minutes. About 10 minutes later his breathing rapidly increased - eventually turning to large gasps of air. The patient then briefly passed out but then quickly woke up. He then started vomiting for the next 10 minutes. Eventually he recovered enough to walk with the help of his wife. The wife stated that he has had episodes like this from other vaccines and blood draws. He has never vomited from the episodes, however.

Awakened suddenly at 23:30, 8.5 hours after shot, by vomitus arising in throat, only just had time to lean over and vomit into wastebasket. A few dry heaves followed, and cough, possibly due to some vomit hitting my windpipe. Did not feel nauseous before, during, or after, though stomach remained a little quivery for a couple of hours. This could have been fatal if I had not woken up: I could have chocked to death on the vomit.

                                                The day after the vaccination I listless and had no appetite. I was very worn out. I felt like that for three days. Everything smelled bad and I didn&#39;t feel like eating anything. My sense of taste was still present. No energy or motivation for two weeks. I tested negative for both Influenza A and B and Covid-19 test was positive. I have gotten the second dose of the vaccine and I was very tired but only for 24 hours. I got the injection in the right arm.

                                                Within a few days of the vaccination, I developed extreme flatulence, with frequent and copious discharges of exceedingly foul-smelling gas throughout the day, sometimes as often as four or more times within an hour. My digestion seemed sluggish and irregular, and I experienced a sense of being bloated (which the discharges somewhat relieved).   All these symptoms continued for about three weeks. At first I thought they simply had to do with something I might have eaten, but this seemed not to be the case. Throughout, my diet, dietary supplements, residence, sleep, environment, and daily routine remained the same -- and the same as they had been for months before.  Additional information for Item 18: Finally, about two weeks ago, I began taking an Ayurvedic digestive medicine (Dashamularista), once daily after lunch, which helped greatly. The discharges of gas reduced considerably in frequency and copiousness and were no longer abnormally foul-smelling. As of this day, however, flatulence still seems somewhat more than usual. Of course, I cannot unerringly testify to a cause-and-effect relationship between the vaccination and the symptoms I have described. But I see no other likely candidate for a cause.   I should mention that within the last few days I have developed mild but disturbing inflammation in the joints of both hands, particularly the knuckles. I have not had this before. I have also felt somewhat listless. (This, however, is not a symptom new for me.) in the last few days I have also developed a mild edema in both feet. But I have had this before from time to time, and the present instance might be attributable to variables such as a change in weather. (In the past this edema was diagnosed as lymphatic in origin, not circulatory.)

Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100.; The next day after patient got the first dose of the covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). A 71-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Mar2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6207; Expiration Date: 06Jun2021) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included liver transplant, Patient&#39;s liver transplant was 6 years ago. A-Fib from an unknown date. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital in (Name). Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter believes that patients sister has A-Fib. There were no concomitant medications. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was None. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was None. Patient received a flu vaccine way back in Aug2020. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was Not provided. It was reported that the patient received the first dose of the Pfizer of the vaccine was on 24Mar2021, Wednesday, at 4pm. On Thursday, usual fatigue, that people get, Friday morning, diarrhea 1 bout, and dizziness, gave him water, HR erratic 80, 90 to 70 into 100, which as like AFib, BP went to 64/55, put in in w/c had him lay down, hand cold, weak, drain. He drank electrolyte water. started to take BP and HR and Oxygen level, his Blood pressure was 64/55, She called PCP, the nurse got on the phone and asked questions, and monitor what had happened, monitored Heart rate until 20 minutes it became regulated, in the 90s and staying in the 90s. If his heart rate goes above 110 call me back. continued to do the water thing, did not call her back, things started to normalize, BP normalized in 2 hours and heart rate about the same. The following day, Saturday, he had pressure low but not as low, again just watched and pushed fluids, and got better each day, fatigue got better that Saturday. No other incident following incident. Reporter called yesterday several people, cardiologist, transplant coordinator, PCP again to get advise and direction. She wanted to know whether this was an allergic reaction, even though it happened later, could he get the second shot, could it be worse following the second shot. The reporter was advised that their doctor/healthcare provider is in the best position to assess and advise as their doctor/healthcare provider was most familiar with the medical condition, clinical history, how the treatment had been conducted and any relevant information to the specific case. It was stated that, the patient took Pfizer covid vaccine (Verbatim) to get whatever protection he can from the virus. Patient is a liver transplant patient and (Name) wanted him to get the covid vaccine. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue. Early Friday morning, he woke up patient had one bout of diarrhea. Then patient went into A-Fib. Patient&#39;s heart rate was jumping from being in the 80s to 90s to 70s, to above 100, jumping all around. Patient&#39;s blood pressure was 64/55. The reason that reporter thought to take patient&#39;s blood pressure is because he became dizzy. As soon as patient got dizzy, reporter had him start drinking electrolyte water, and he lay down in bed. Patients hands were ice cold and he was weak and drained. Reporter called patient&#39;s doctors office, and talked to the nurse. With the nurse on the phone, reporter and nurse continued to monitor patients heart rate and blood pressure. The highest that patients heart rate got was 101. The nurse believed that patient was in A-Fib. Maybe after 15 minutes of patient drinking cold water, things started normalize a bit. Patient&#39;s heart rate was in the 90s at least it was fluctuating within the 90s. Later, patients blood pressure was still pretty low, it was low for 2 hours. The following day, patient also had low blood pressure. The patient continued to drink cold water, and the reporter was monitoring him. The patient did not go into A-Fib again the next day. Reporter has called several people. Reporter has called transplant people, and patients primary care physician. Reporter was asking them questions about the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they thought it was an allergic reaction. Reporter asked them if it could happen again with the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter asked them if they think that patient should receive the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. Patient received first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine at a (Name). Reporter asked them if they think that patient should be monitored for a longer time. Reporter asked them if patient could get worse after the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Reporter was told many different things by all of them. The doctor from would not recommend patient to get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, but the Doctor also would not recommend for patient to not get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. The doctor would not say either way, he would only say that he would like for the patient to be vaccinated. The doctor also said that he did not know if it was an allergic reaction, because he was not there to see patient. Patients primary care doctor told reporter that the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine is just a needle in his arm, patient just had side effects and that patient should go on and get the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine. Primary care doctor told reporter that he did not think it made a difference if patient received the second dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine in a clinical setting. The doctor told reporter that it would be smart for patient to receive second dose of Pfizer covid vaccine at a clinic or hospital setting or whatever. Reporter states that they are looking for some direction. Reporter knows that patient is doing a study with transplant patients. Doctor claimed that transplant patients have all done well with the first dose of the covid vaccine, but only 17% of people got an immune response from the first shot. Patient is hoping for better rates for the second dose of the covid vaccine. Reporter does not know if they are willing to risk patient receiving the second dose of the covid vaccine with patients A-Fib. Reporter states that regardless of what people think of A-Fib, A-Fib increases the risk of a stroke times five. Reporter does not want to purposely put patient into A-Fib. In Feb2020 when covid first came out, patient became ill and was hospitalized for sepsis and double pneumonia. Patient&#39;s A-Fib lasted 7 days, he was in an excellent hospital. Patients heart rate was up above the 170s. The hospital could not manage patients A-Fib because he was so sick. It was not Covid, it was stress. Reporter has memories of that, and reporter does not want that to happen again. The next day after patient got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine, he had a little bit of fatigue: Patient did not go to church on Sunday. Patient started feeling better on Saturday, 27Mar2021. Early Friday morning, patient had one bout of diarrhea: Reporter clarifies that patient experienced diarrhea and got dizziness.

After the A-Fib started, patients heart got more stable after about 20 minutes. Reporter then hung up with the nurse from patients primary care physicians office.

It was informed that patient had vaccination on right arm because he had a dialysis fistula in his left arm. Relevant medical history included also ongoing End stage renal disease, dialysis on 13Apr2021. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EP6955) and experienced arm pain and headache. Concomitant medications were not reported.  On 11Apr2021 the patient experienced shivering and quaking and chills, nauseous and vomiting, panic attack, &#39;was freaking out&#39;, soft pain in left side of chest, fast pulse , all provided as non serious. On the same day 11Apr2021 the patient also experienced difficulty breathing, low oxygen blood level,  potassium level increased and extra fluid in his body which led to the emergency room and admission to the hospital. Clinical course was described as follows: everything was going good until Sunday at 3:29 am. Her husband woke up shivering, quaking, and he was freaking out repeating oh my god, so she called emergency number.  When her husband found out that she couldn&#39;t get into the ambulance with her husband and ride to the hospital, so her husband refused to go to the hospital. She states that her husband also felt nauseous and vomited in this period of time. She stated that he had no fever, though. So fast forward to 8:30 am her husband was having difficulty breathing, and she called again and this time they had 7 paramedics come out to the house. She states that all of them were very nice. An EKG was performed because patient reported that he had a soft pain in his left side of his chest. She states that everything was cool with that, except his pulse rate was high. She states that he also had low blood oxygen level. She states that they strapped in her husband in and drove him to the hospital to the ER. At the ER they discovered that potassium level increased and she said that he had some extra fluid in his body. He was a dialyses patient so they gave him dialysis on Sunday evening. He had calmed down at that point and they were constantly taking blood from him. She found out about the COVID vaccine had potassium and phosphate as active ingredients and her husband shouldn&#39;t have that. She also informed that they had to give him a tranquilizer because he was having a panic attack during this whole episode. She says that they gave him alprazolam. Patient doesn&#39;t know exactly when the side effects went away because he didn&#39;t have a clock or a phone. Patient&#39;s wife also clarified that he vomited twice before going to the hospital but then he felt like he had to vomit afterwards but he did not. She stated that his breathing problems didn&#39;t stop when paramedics came and gave him oxygen. They made it to their house by 8:40 am, and he still had low oxygen level, they were still giving oxygen the whole time he was in the hospital. The patient was discharged on 13Apr2021. At the time of the reporting event outcome was unknown.

COVID-19 Unknown, Acute respiratory failure with hypoxia Yes, Palliative care encounter Not Applicable, Declining functional status No. DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY; Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission, Sepsis, due to unspecified organism, unspecified whether acute organ dysfunction present. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19,Respiratory failure. Sigmoid perforation with abscess. Hospital Course; 71-year-old male prolonged admission for acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. No history of colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung mets. Prior resection of bowel, prior chemotherapy. Required management in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure over the time that he has been admitted to Hospital (20 days). He had remained on BiPAP therapy throughout that time, received appropriate corticosteroids, and antiviral therapies. Approximately 1-1/2 weeks ago he began to develop mild left lower quadrant abdominal pain. In the last 48 hours this is significantly worsened. CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained on Friday, which displayed pneumoperitoneum, sigmoid abscess with sigmoid perforation. There is a prior anastomotic site distal to this. Given his overall complexity he was to be medically managed to avoid the need for OR and intubation.  He did well through the initial 24 hours of IV antibiotics, fluids and bowel rest. This afternoon he became increasingly dyspneic, required implementing nonrebreather mask, and subsequently developed severe rigors, tachycardia.  I obtained a stat follow-up CT scan which shows similar findings of free air within the abdomen. Given signs of impending sepsis, BiPAP therapy was initiated, bolus IV fluids were given. Blood gas, blood counts, lactic acid are pending.  He is receiving empiric Zosyn.  I discussed this with general surgery, whom is well-known to the patient. In agreement the patient likely needs surgical intervention. However given his overall complexity and in light of the fact that this area surrounds the ureter, and we do not have urology coverage. It was felt he was most appropriate to be managed in Hospital. Case was discussed with Dr. at Hospital, patient will be transferred there via air transit. At this time his blood pressure appears stable, he is tachycardia, is currently on BiPAP which will be transitioned to CPAP for transport. He has received several doses of Dilaudid, for improved pain control. No further advancement of airway was performed prior to discharge. Case was discussed with family at length, all risks and benefits of transfer were discussed with wife and patient. It is recommended to involve pulmonary critical care services including surgical ICU care as if requiring surgery he is high likelihood for prolonged vent needs.

DETAILS OF HOSPITAL STAY Presenting Problem/History of Present Illness/Reason for Admission Respiratory failure, acute, Hospital Course; Patient is a 71 yr.. male with history of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, prior bowel resection and chemotherapy. The patient initially tested positive for Covid in early March. His symptoms at that time are mild and resolved. He was later vaccinated and that month. He started having severe symptoms again on 4/3 for which he presented to Hospital. Since that time, he has received full course of Remdesivir and steroids. He had a CT scan performed on 4/23 which revealed pneumoperitoneum secondary to presumed perforated sigmoid diverticulitis with focal sigmoid abscess. Patient was weaned down to minimal nasal cannula settings but somewhat suddenly earlier on 4/25 patient had increased work of breathing, became tachycardia, and had rigors. Hospital ordered repeat CT scan which showed similar findings in the abdomen. Patient had been maintained on Zosyn. Repeat labs were sent which were largely unremarkable. Given concerns for worsening sepsis and potential need for surgery, he was subsequently transferred Hospital. On admission to hospital, he had a normal lactic acid and no leukocytosis. He did not have evidence of peritonitis. The decision was made to treat his diverticulitis conservatively. However, early on 4/26 the patient started to develop a lactic acidosis. An extensive discussion was had with the patient and his wife regarding surgery and the possibility the patient may never be able to separate from the vent given his worsening Covid pneumonia. The patient elected to undergo an exploratory laparotomy with with segmental resection of distal descending and loop transverse colostomy. However, as the days progressed the patient had worsening respiratory status that required deep sedation, paralytics and proning all of which were unsuccessful in maintaining his oxygen saturation greater than 88%. His wife, knowing that he would not want to have a prolonged course on the ventilator, elected for transition to palliative extubating with comfort care on 4/30 and the patient expired roughly 10 minutes after extubation.

Each attack lasted 15 to 25 minutes, and seemed to be alleviated by taking anti-acid (simethicone) pills. Quite likely related the vaccine: 11 days after the vaccine was administered, I experienced a rather severe headache, plus slight general weakness, and a raised temperature of between 98.9 and 100.4 degrees. The first 10 days I had discerned no adverse effects. This has lasted16 hours so far, with little alleviation.

The caller reports she should have given him Maalox but they had Dulcolax at home and the urgent care doctor said that was fine to take. Besides that he took 2 of Citrucel tablets and then managed to give him a little apple juice. He could not eat anymore his bowels are pretty messed up and he was going to the bathroom a little bit. He hasn&#39;t been eating very much. He was going to go to the ER Saturday night but it was a zoo in there, somehow he made it through the weekend. They have been putting frozen peas wrapped in towels on his stomach. He was miserable with pain. On Monday, 01Mar2021 he went to his primary care doctor and told him to go straight to the emergency room. The caller reports that, in fact, when she and her husband were at the primary care doctor, the doctor told them that, this is anecdotal info, that she (the doctor) received the Pfizer vaccine and it was about the same amount of time that she experienced the same kind of pain but hers went away after about 2 hours. Caller reports the doctor is young. With all the laxatives the patient had taken, he had the runs. They admitted him to the hospital and they ran all kinds of tests. His white blood cell count was 18000. Because he was in so much pain, his blood pressure was out of the roof. Patient is still in the hospital running tests. They are treating him with antibiotics. They think he may have a bug in his colon. To be on the safe side they are wearing gowns if someone goes into his room because they don&#39;t know what kind of bug/bacteria it is. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. The caller is waiting on a call from her husband&#39;s nurse. When querying weight caller states he&#39;s lost 10 pounds, he&#39;s 142 pounds if he&#39;s lucky. The patient received the first Covid 19 vaccine at around 4:15pm on 25Feb2021. At about 8:45 AM Saturday morning, 27Feb2021, the caller was still in bed her husband was getting in the bed and he said he didn&#39;t feel good, he never complains, so she knew something was wrong. He was making a bowl of cereal, he got the cheerios in the bowl and he went to get the milk and just that quick the pain came on just in the middle of his stomach. Kind of like in that area below your breast bone and ribs and rib cage, where it all meshes together. And the pain was just intense. He said it doubled him over and he broke out in a sweat. In the hospital he was given morphine and that didn&#39;t work, didn&#39;t help the pain. He was also given a &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, asked caller what was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34;, she said something to numb him. Lidocaine was in the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; but she is not sure what else. GI cocktail took a long time before there was even a bit of relief. Caller states the nurse said don&#39;t look at the &#34;GI cocktail&#34; it&#39;s kind of gross. The caller found out that she can only go during certain hours to visit. Caller reports yesterday her husband looked better and his pain level was under control. He was given like hydrocodone or one of those &#34;codone&#34; medications and the nurse said he had not complained of pain in 7 hours. But his white blood cell count was higher at 19500. The caller believes the combination between hydrocodone for pain and maybe the antibiotic is starting to work. But the white blood cell count was still so sky high, eventually the white blood cell count would have to come down if the medications are working. He is more comfortable because of the pain meds. Her husband has had several different times when he has gotten all sweaty and is wanting something to wipe his forehead, feeling warm/hot. The sweating has come back but he never had a fever. She reports her husband&#39;s and her own arm were a little sore. Soreness was more noticeable by 26Feb2021. When querying the outcome of her husband&#39;s sore arm caller states since the stomach pain he hasn&#39;t said anything about the arm pain. She thinks his arm was much more sore than hers was because he was complaining quite about that. Caller reports when they were asking questions at the hospital, like how would he get this bug, how did he get it, did it come from food, like drive thru fast food. The nurse said it could have come from anywhere even medicine. Caller and her husband made sure that all the doctors, all three doctors and they were baffled and they mentioned that he had received the covid 19 vaccine. The nurse said that it could have come from the Covid 19 vaccine. And now her husband is scared to get the second shot. The caller reports she thought with the mrn or whatever it is, with how the vaccine was made she didn&#39;t think there was medicine in the vaccine that could cause a bug to grow. That it could be from some kind of medication. The timing is suspicious. She reports they stay out of the fray and try to reduce the fray and stay out of the numbers. They miss every one of their family and friends. The medications he is on, he has been on for a long time. He takes medication to control his blood pressure. The patient also had a CT scan, the main reason for the CT scan was to make sure there wasn&#39;t a blockage in his bowels, but the CT scan came back normal. Within the first few hours of being at the hospital, they took his blood 4 times. They were told immediately that he was going to be admitted. They also did a Covid test, it was negative, otherwise he would have been moved a to a different floor. There&#39;s more stuff, his oxygen, he had to be put on oxygen and also his blood pressure, it was 214 over something, it stayed really high because of his intense pain. And now that he&#39;s there he has to have something for being a diabetic. They tested his urine. He has not been able to provide a stool sample. They are waiting for a stool sample to determine the type of bug he has. The nurse told her there are 2 bugs that are dangerous and highly contagious. Anyone who goes into his room has to wear a special gown. He was told in the hospital that he was dehydrated. He couldn&#39;t get anything down. Also on Saturday, 27Feb2021 he threw up like 5 times. He has had some spells of nausea, like when your mouth gets wet. Apparently he was going to the bathroom a little bit he had 2 full doses by the time he was checked in to the hospital Monday, 01Mar2021 at 1200. His bowels were empty that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been able to do the stool sample test. Event severe stomach pain and bug in his colon lead to emergency room and physician office visit. The patient was currently hospitalized. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures on unspecified dates which included computerised tomogram (CT): normal, covid test: negative, urine analysis: unknown results, white blood cell count: 18000, white blood cell count: 19500, blood pressure measurement: 214 over something (really high; was out of the roof), weight: lost 10 pounds. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of terrible terrible stomach pain and bug in his colon. Events terrible terrible stomach pain, bug in his colon, broke out in sweats, feeling warm was recovering, event vomiting 5 times was recovered on 27Feb2021, event nausea was recovered on 01Mar2021, other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021253476 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient;US-PFIZER INC-2021253512 Same reporter/product, similar event and different patient

Pt received covid19 vaccine on 2/16/2019 while inpatient, right before his discharge on 2/17/2021.Of note, pt was put on hospice care at the time of discharge to patient&#39;s home. He passed away on 2/26/2021. I could not find the death notice in the chart (which usually contains the medical cause of death). This was reported to us from an staff. The following describes his hospitalization: At facility, was noted to be dehydrated and reported to not have been taking his medications or having good PO intake. Per reports from nursing home, patient wasnoted to have difficulty swallowing&#34; and spit up meals and medications. SLP evaluation with concerns for mastication and dysphagia. At time of hospitalization his Na was at 153, also noted to have AKI2. His hypernatremia, aki, and dehydration resolved with fluid replacement. His potassium was also replaced. His constipation resolved with laxatives which also improved his abdominal discomfort. Also, his olanzapine was changed to disintegrating tablet which helped with his intermittent agitation. Currently, he was calm, amenable, and with medication compliance. To help with his poor appetite, his mirtazapine dose was increased to 30 mg from 15 mg. Pt was discharged on 2/17/2021 when family decided to place him under hospice care.

When he was halfway there he started developing a pounding sensation in his midsternal chest without radiation.  When he got in the car it was associated with significant diaphoresis.  Rapid response was called and the patient was brought to the ED immediately.  Initial EKG does show an acute lateral MI.  Patient additionally had 2 episodes of vomiting.  He denies any recent fever, chills, cough, runny nose, sore throat.  He denies any abdominal pain or urinary symptoms.  He has been compliant with his medications but his medical record states that he has a history of noncompliance.  He additionally was just seen by cardiology and was advised that everything was stable in the neck follow-up with me in 6 months.  He rates his pain as a 10 out of 10.

A 72-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the right arm on 16Apr2021 10:00 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 2nd dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included blood clot years ago, ongoing leukemia (in remission), coma, gout (he takes a gout medicine), neuropathic pain, pain, high blood pressure, thyroid (disorder), varicose veins and uses rollator (his wheelchair with a seat). Concomitant medications included metoprolol taken for high blood pressure from an unspecified start date and ongoing; levothyroxine sodium (THYROXINE) taken for thyroid from an unspecified start date and ongoing; hydrocodone taken for pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; imatinib taken for leukemia in remission from an unspecified start date and ongoing; gabapentin taken for neuropathic pain from an unspecified start date and ongoing; iron taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; folic acid (FOLATE) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; vitamin d nos (VITAMIN D) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; and ongoing unspecified gout medicine. The patient previously took morphine; he had a shot of morphine in the emergency room sometime before his COVID vaccine. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 on 25Mar2021 (batch/lot number: unknown) as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Vaccination facility was PRIVACY she thinks. Prior vaccination (4 weeks prior) were none. The patient&#39;s sister reported that they both had their second dose and she forgot to tell the other woman she spoke to about herself because the caller&#39;s focus was on her elderly brother who was 72-years-old. They both received their COVID vaccines in the morning of 16Apr2021, a Friday, and within hours her brother felt very bad. She went downstairs and saw her brother vomiting in the trash can and he just said that he hurt and that he felt nauseated. This continued for a few days, in fact it continued for 4 days. He was beginning to feel better on Monday, but he was still not up to par. Then Tuesday she guesses her brother was feeling better. On Wednesday night she went downstairs and heard him around 2300 to midnight talking to the dogs and then the next morning she found him unresponsive (22Apr2021). Her first thought was that maybe her brother had a stroke so she called 911. In the emergency room he had a CAT (computerized tomography) scan and at first they said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. But something very unusual was that her brother had a rapid heartbeat and his normal was around 60 but in the emergency room his heartrate was upwards to 120 to 130 to 140. He was then transferred to another hospital where they said the next evening that in fact he did have a stroke even though that first doctor said that he didn&#39;t have a stroke. The doctor didn&#39;t find any further information until 2 days later when the doctor thought her brother already had some blood clots that were thrown into the frontal, temporal and parietal region in his brain. She was a biologist so she can&#39;t say that the COVID vaccine caused this but she thought that Pfizer should be aware of his situation and then she was so focused on her brother that she forgot to tell the other woman the really bizarre things. She had asked certain questions to the doctor based on what her sister was telling her to ask. The caller asked the doctor if her brother was going to be seen by a neurologist and the doctor gave a rambling evasive answer and then turned on his heels and walked out and kicked her out of the hospital. They both had their COVID vaccines in the morning around 1000 or so and she doesn&#39;t know if he was vomiting still the next day or not but her brother felt really bad. He has chronic conditions and he generally just felt bad and he had thought that something was wrong with him. He felt malaise, fatigue, his head hurt and he was nauseated. He ate one bowl of soup that the caller had made for him but he wasn&#39;t really eating. That lasted for about 4 days and then he started to feel better on Tuesday, confirmed to 20Apr2021, and then he felt even better on Wednesday, confirmed to 21Apr2021, because the caller did take him on some trips. He doesn&#39;t drive. Her brother said that he felt feverish and the caller says that he felt feverish to the touch as well but the thermometer said that he didn&#39;t have a fever because it had an error sign when she took his temperature. Unresponsive: Her brother was fine Wednesday night around 2300, maybe midnight, she had heard him downstairs talking to the dogs and she knew that he was okay. Then the next morning, 22Apr2021, she found him slumped into his rollator (his wheelchair with a seat) and he was slumped over and had stuff that looked like had came out of his mouth and he had vomit on legs. He was unresponsive so she called 911 and said that she thought her brother had a stroke. The operator said to lay him flat and the caller was finally able to get him up and then his arm got hung up and the operator said again to get her brother on the floor and get him flat. She understands that this was important and she was able to do it but they all fell down, her brother, her and the rollator. Shortly after this the ambulance had shown up. The ambulance took her brother to the emergency room in town and they said that her brother&#39;s heartrate was fast. She gave them all of the relevant information but she didn&#39;t think to tell them about the COVID vaccine. They said that her brother&#39;s heart was acting eradicate and it was very fast. Again, his normal heartrate is in the 60s and it was going from 110 to 140s and it wasn&#39;t coming down. She told them that when he was unresponsive that she thought he was having agonal breathing. In the emergency room, her brother&#39;s breathing was still not very good and she heard the doctor say that her brother had stopped breathing but then he came back so that&#39;s when he was intubated in the emergency room. They did a CAT scan of his head and his neck and the doctor comes back and said that her brother didn&#39;t have a stroke. But that was not the case according to a different doctor&#39;s later assessment. Approximately around 1430 to 1445 on that Thursday, 22Apr2021, they transferred him to PRIVACY,  where he was in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). His heartrate conditioned to being very fast. He went from the emergency room to the ICU. Thursday when he got transferred to the ICU they didn&#39;t do any diagnostic tests that day, he was still intubated and his heartrate was still up into the next day, Friday, 23Apr2021. It wasn&#39;t until late in the afternoon that a doctor came in and said that her brother did have a stroke he has even had prior strokes too. They had done an MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) on Friday of his brain, which was not what they did in the first emergency room, that showed that he had a stroke in his temporal, frontal and parietal regions of his brain. At first caller states that on Saturday, he opened his eyes but he was still unresponsive essentially but then she says that this statement was wrong because he actually didn&#39;t respond that quickly. He has gone into a coma once before and when he had came out of it a very unpleasant thing happened that was very personal so she was not going to tell it. On Saturday and Sunday the doctor didn&#39;t want to answer the callers questions, this was a different doctor than the first ICU doctor and this one didn&#39;t have good bedside manner. Finally on Monday, 26Apr2021, her brother started responding. He was moving his legs with purpose, he had tried to kick the nurse, and he had made some words. The day before this, on Sunday the caller had brought the priest in to bless her brother and he sort of nodded and he seemed to make movements but he was still not able to talk. Monday he said what sounded like words and then Tuesday he made, what seemed to her like, meaningful statements. She was told that he had an ultrasound of his neck to see if he had any clogged arteries or veins and the nurse said that the test results came back good that their were no clogs. But this was where the whole story just becomes awful. Caller discusses how there were issues with a cousin having power of attorney from 2015 that was supposedly no longer valid according to the caller and she had spoke with administration and then she got kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday because of a question she had asked the doctor about her brother seeing a neurologist. The doctor said that the neurologist makes his own schedule and it might be 10 days or more if he even decided he wanted to see her brother. When the doctor asked the caller how would she like her brother&#39;s care to be she mentioned that he was in a coma before and was being treated for similar circumstances from PRIVACY and that he was seen by a neurologist and she said that maybe her brother should be seen by PRIVACY and the doctor walked out and within minutes she was being escorted out of the hospital for belittling the doctor and calling administration. Now they won&#39;t even let flowers be delivered to her brother. Unfortunately the person who has been involved with him the most, the caller, was now barred from him. She was not saying that this was all due to the Pfizer COVID vaccine but why were they saying that she has a blood clot too. She has had headaches but they may be due to stress. She didn&#39;t feel sick like her brother. She has a question and she was really scared about the answer. She was just now reading that if you&#39;re on immunosuppressant drugs then you&#39;re not supposed to have the COVID vaccine. She asked was that true. Well her brother was in remission for leukemia and he was on a cancer medication called imatinib. Caller declined to speak to medical information about this and says it was already too late because he was already taking it and she doesn&#39;t know why he didn&#39;t stop them. Her brother&#39;s friends have tried to call and they were all getting the same statement, which she believes the hospital was stone walling, but the hospital says that they don&#39;t have a patient by his name and they have even told the florist the same thing. So caller was unsure if her brother has been discharged or not. He didn&#39;t seem to be in the shape to be shipped to a care facility but she doesn&#39;t know. It was hard for her to piece it all together. The hospital wasn&#39;t feeding her brother enough before she left so for all she knows they could be starving him to death and holding nutrition from him. History/ Investigations: His medications were ones that he has been taking for years and she doesn&#39;t know exact start dates for any and if she needs to she can get the dosage information from the pharmacy. Her brother has hid his pills before and he puts them in different bottles, it was a nightmare. He takes a gout medicine and she doesn&#39;t know the name of it. Those were the main ones that he takes other than the cancer medicine she said earlier. And he also takes gabapentin for some of his neuropathic pain and he takes something at night and a few others she thinks. For medical conditions the only thing that she knows was that many years ago he had a blood clot but she can&#39;t really say what year it was. She does know that her brother wasn&#39;t on any blood thinners to he knowledge and not long ago he had an ultrasound of his legs to determine if he had a blood clot but she was not 100 % sure if he had that but she thinks he did. Her brother told her that years ago he had blood clots that were due to weight lifting causing varicose veins and later they collateralized and they found out that the other secondary vessels took over for pumping his blood so it wasn&#39;t a problem. Her concern was can someone from Pfizer talk to her about what&#39;s going on with her brother, she knows Pfizer doesn&#39;t have his records but how will Pfizer be able to determine if this was from the COVID vaccine. She guesses that she was curious about what may of caused the blood clots. She mentioned the COVID vaccine to one doctor and he didn&#39;t seem like she respected her knowledge. She asked was there anything that can be done to help her brother if it was a blood clot. She was upset that the hospital and her wanting her brother to see a neurologist and beginning with a claim that he didn&#39;t have a stroke and then a claim that he did. She thinks that they were not doing enough for her brother and they were just saying oh well, it was all due to a fast heart rate which can happen as a result of the COVID vaccine. She was going to be honest, she was exhausted and she can&#39;t keep talking for a long time. She asked if she can call medical information back later when she was more refreshed. Consumer further stated that her brother had complaints of feeling ill, feverish and having no appetite. Caller stated that the next Thursday she found her brother unconscious, heart rate was elevated 120 to140 beats per minute and that her brother had a stroke. The outcome was recovered on 21Apr2021 for the events Malaise, Nauseated, Fatigue, Headache and Appetite absent; recovering for the event Vomiting; and unknown for the rest of the events.

                                                Muscle pain and joint pain a few days after getting the vaccine; Muscle pain and joint pain a few days after getting the vaccine; Nausea; Upset Stomach; For getting different aches and pains, and he has back pain anyway; Injection site pain; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 72-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 20May2021 15:00 (Lot Number: EWO161; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing conditions of acid reflux, borderline high blood pressure, borderline cholesterol, pre-existing condition of arthritis (wrist and elbow) and diverticulitis. Family Medical History Relevant to AEs were none and any relevant tests were none. Concomitant medication included omeprazole taken for gastrooesophageal reflux disease from an unspecified start date and ongoing; atorvastatin calcium taken for blood cholesterol from an unspecified start date and ongoing; carvedilol taken for blood pressure measurement from an unspecified start date and ongoing. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect were none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect were none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) were none (Patient stated when he takes the flu vaccine, he gets the flu, but he hasn&#39;t had one in a long time and he had the pneumonia vaccine and that was fine). The patient wanted to know if the second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine can be taken later than 3 weeks and if the AEs that he experienced would be a restriction in getting the second shot of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. The patient wanted to know how long his reported AEs usually lasted based on Pfizer studies after the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine, if the side effects that he experienced are included in the commonly reported adverse events after getting the first dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 Vaccine. The patient said that after he got first shot for the vaccine, it was going good and then the next day where the shot was given, it started aching. The patient experienced injection site pain and different aches and pains, and back pain on 21May2021, muscle pain and joint pain a few days after getting the vaccine. The patient stated when that started, it trigged his arthritis in his right wrist, and he had joint aches. He said that can happen too and said it would go away but it did not, and it played around and made his joints ache and then it went away. He also experienced the pain on the left extremity, but it was the right arm was mostly his concern. He also stated that the pain somehow messed with his ankle joints and is also considering that this may be related to his pre-existing condition of arthritis (wrist and elbow). He stated that these AEs comes and goes away but was something that is persistent and that got him concerned about. The patient said that next morning it came back again, not heavy or as bad but off and on and kept changing. He stated that he uses his arm and exercises it and keeps using it. He stated that he also experienced nausea (5 or 6 days after the shot) and upset stomach but is mostly concerned with the arm, join and muscle pain which was predominantly felt on his right extremity where he got his vaccine shot. The patient stated that nausea could be part of his acid indigestion stuff, and that if he eats, it goes away. Patient stated the first time he had the nausea was the worst and after that, it was just kind of there, like a bad upset stomach. When he eats, it was all right again and that he can&#39;t be on an empty stomach and he can&#39;t eat a large amount. Patient said he takes medications for acid reflux and diverticulitis and he has to keep eating regularly and stated that the arm pain has never went away and it was still there. The patient did not have any emergency room/ physician office visit. The outcome of injection site pain (it doesn&#39;t stop him from doing anything) and different aches and pains, and back pain, nausea, upset stomach was not recovered. The outcome of muscle pain and joint pain was unknown. Therapeutic measures included acetaminophen (TYLENOL), 650 mg (Expiration: Jul2023 Lot: SJA033) for different aches and back pain which helped some but didn&#39;t take it all away. The patient was about to receive his second shot on 10Jun2021.

A 73-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 29Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was vaccinated at a hospital. Medical history included heart rate irregular and blood pressure high. Concomitant medications were none. The patient said he had an irregular heartbeat after getting his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021. He said he had to go to the Emergency Room on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He clarified he checked his blood pressure at home and his blood pressure was low at 91/73. He said he also had a high pulse rate of 160, or better, for 9-1/2 hours. He said the only thing he can attribute his low blood pressure and high pulse rate to is the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he hasn&#39;t heard anything about the COVID-19 Vaccine being related to having an effect on the heart, but he personally believes it was his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose that caused his low blood pressure and high pulse rate. He clarified after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine on Friday, 29Jan2021, he had a sore right arm after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, fatigue, tiredness, and nausea. He said on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he wasn&#39;t feeling well. He said he recognized a small amount of chills, feeling feverish without having a fever, and sweating. He said his wife checked his temperature a few times on Saturday, 30Jan2021, and he never had a fever, but he felt clammy. He said he had noticed the nausea more than anything else. He said he maybe should have checked his blood pressure on Saturday, 30Jan2021. He said he didn&#39;t check his blood pressure until Sunday morning, 31Jan2021, and when he saw his low blood pressure and high pulse rate, he called the hospital and eventually drove to the Emergency Room. He said by the time he had got to the Emergency Room his blood pressure had went up to &#34;100 and something&#34;, but his pulse rate never changed, and his pulse was still 160. He said the doctor gave him several medications to try to get his pulse rate to come down. He said the doctor had given him a medication that was supposed to bring his pulse down. He said then the doctor had to add something else in a syringe to go with the other medication to bring his pulse down. He said he wasn&#39;t sure of the medication&#39;s name. He clarified he never noticed his pulse rate was high until he took his blood pressure on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he felt the nausea start later Friday evening (29Jan2021). He said he already has stomach trouble anyways that he takes medicine for, so he took a pill, but the nausea continued. He clarified he took 1 Omeprazole 20mg capsule that was dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, but stated the Omeprazole 20mg prescription looked like it expired in 2017. He said he knows he has a newer Omeprazole prescription, but did not know where the prescription bottle was. He reported on Saturday, 30Jan2021, he just laid around. He said he did not feel as bad on Saturday, as he did on Sunday, 31Jan2021. He said he called the Emergency Room on Sunday morning, and went to the Emergency Room. He said he didn&#39;t feel his 160 pulse rate. He said he was told by the doctor in the Emergency Room that his fast heart rate had his heart beating like he was having a stress test. He reported he doesn&#39;t know if he wants to get the second COVID-19 Vaccine shot after what he experienced this past weekend. He reported he only takes blood pressure medicine that he has  been on for a while. He reported he had several EKGs done on Sunday, 31Jan2021, while he was in the Emergency Room. He said the EKG showed Atrial Fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate in the 160s. He reported while he was in the Emergency Room he was given IV Heparin, IV Potassium, Potassium pills, and Amiodarone in a pill and IV form. He said the doctor added another IV medicine in a syringe, but he doesn&#39;t know the name of the medicine. He said the doctor also gave him IV Morphine because he had pain in his chest. He said the doctor said his chest pain was being caused by his heart trying to go back into a regular rhythm.  He reported he was in the Emergency Room for 11-12 hours before he was admitted to the hospital. He said his pulse rate wasn&#39;t coming down and stayed at 160 for 9-1/2 hours. He said the doctor wanted to admit him to the hospital, so he could have a procedure to make sure the high pulse rate didn&#39;t damage his heart. He said on Monday, 01Feb2021, he had a procedure where they went through his wrist and put a dye in his heart to see if the stress from his high pulse rate damaged his heart. He said his heart wasn&#39;t damaged, so he was discharged from the hospital later in the day on 01Feb2021. He clarified his blood pressure was good by the time the first or second EKG was performed in the Emergency Room. He clarified he already had an issue with sweating before he received his first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. He said he is still sweating, but he doesn&#39;t know if that is because of the COVID-19 vaccine. Clinical outcome of high pulse rate and blood pressure low was recovered on 31Jan2021; nausea, fatigue/tiredness recovered on 02Feb2021; chills, feeling feverish recovered on an unspecified date; sweating was not recovered; while for the other events was unknown.

Three days following the first dose, I started to experience hematuria as well as constipation. It has happened before as a result of radiation treatment back in 2005/2006. Saw my urologist on 02/02/2021, and  had several tests, ruling out any return of cancer. Antibiotics improved the situation, which was getting closer to normal prior to getting the second dose. Again, three days following the second dose, hematuria returned and still prevails at various degrees. Also experience fatigue and weight loss.

Uneasy sleep, awoke the following morning in a sweat, with overall discomfort and nausea, began to retch and vomit for nearly 13 hrs. throughout the only comfort was to sit in a hot shower till the hot water ran out sometime falling into a deep sleep, I did this many times through the day, Accompanying this was a general fog and complete loss of equilibrium, extreme weakness. this made it difficult to move from bed to bath or anywhere in my home. I am writing this at 5:13 am Mar  6 and find it hard to gather thoughts.

                                                Patient received his first dose of Pfizer Covid 19 vaccine.  Patient was screened and given vaccine with no incident.  Patient was waiting in observation area for 30 mins post the vaccine.  About 10 mins post vaccination patient felt sick to his stomach and spit up into his mask.  He called pharmacy staff over and we gave garbage pale to spit up into.  He spit up approximately 10ml of orange phlegm and that was all.  He asked for water to rinse his mouth so staff gave him a little bit of water to rinse with.  Pharmacist stayed with patient and monitored him for additional adverse effects.  Pharmacist took patient&#39;s blood pressure which was 174/98 at 3:21pm 14 mins post vaccination and a second time 19mins post vaccination at 3:26pm it was 150/90.  Patient reported having history of acid reflux and he had just had orange juice and Jax (cheetos) so he believed it was due to what he ate.  We continued to monitor patient.  He stated he was feeling fine and wanted to leave.  Pharmacist asked to recheck his BP at which he declined saying he was feeling fine and the 150/90 is normal for him.  The pharmacist help to escort the patient to the front registers to make sure he was not experiencing anything else and at that time patient stated he felt fine and was leaving the store.

The patient did not know if he had bloody stool then, because he didn&#39;t turn on the light, but ever since then, it has been bloody. No BM&#39;s (bowel movement) since yesterday (09Mar2021). The patient was tired yesterday (09Mar2021). He just laid around all day on a heating pad. He had a dull ache in stomach since it started (07Mar2021). Still there today, but not that bad. The patient stated he had radiation treatment for early stage prostate cancer, they tried to prevent burning or damaging the rectum, but this could be related to that. On Sunday night (07Mar2021), about midnight, he got an awful, awful stomach pain that woke him up about midnight. He tried to move his bowels 2-3 times Sunday night (07Mar2021) and on Monday morning (08Mar2021) he was able to move them a little bit. His underwear he had from Sunday night had lots of red stains in them, and all day Monday (08Mar2021) he was having a bellyache. Every time he managed to move his bowels and it was bloody and seemed to get bloodier pretty much all day. Yesterday (09Mar2021), he laid on a heating pad and went to bed early about 20:30, he usually goes about 22:00. He managed to stay in bed for about 9 hours, and he usually can&#39;t sleep that long. He slept on his side. He started having dark thoughts (unspecified date Mar2021), stating that last Spring and early Summer he went through treatment for 45 days with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). On Monday night (08Mar2021), the patient had terrible cramps about midnight, with very cold sweat and diarrhea. The next morning (09Mar2021), every bowel movement was very bloody. Then all day Tuesday (09Mar2021) very lethargic. No more bowel movements until the following Friday. The patient stated he felt like I was trying to pass a blood clot. The patient stated he seemed to have problems with bowels all day yesterday (09Mar2021) and was not much better; he had really low energy (09Mar2021). Today (10Mar2021), he seemed to feel better, but not much. He had not eaten much (Mar2021) and was hesitant to put food in his system, since his system was not functioning very well. The patient had not been seen by doctor or in an emergency room. His wife was a retired nurse, and they have discussed if he was not better, they were going to call his primary care provider and urologist. The patient had coffee this morning (10Mar2021), and he barely touched it yesterday morning. So far, no bloody discharge, no discharge or bowel movements today. Three to four times in the night he did pass gas (Mar2021), and that was all that happened. The patient knew side effects were rare with this (vaccine) and unsure if these side effects were something reported; this was certainly unusual for him. The clinical outcome of bloody stools, dull ache in stomach, had really low energy, terrible cramps, very cold sweat, diarrhea, tired, and lethargic was recovering. The outcome of belly ache, decreased appetite, and gas, was not recovered. The outcome of other events was unknown. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

Have you had anyone called about vitamins or L-methylfolate reacting with it?&#34; Consumer added, &#34;I took it yesterday at noon the vaccine (Clarified as Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine) but this morning when I took L-methylfolate, you know the vitamin B capsule (Captured as L-methylfolate), my stomach started having problem like souring like tingling or agitating or whatever you know, belching a little bit, so I am asking has anybody else reported that. It is kind of confusing, its &#39;sour&#39; kind of tasted. I just want to know has anybody else called. I guess I should stop taking (L-methylfolate) that until what, three weeks or so. Consumer stated, &#34;It&#39;s like tingling like sour stomach and belching. You know sour stomach, belching you know. It&#39;s not nausea. I got sensitive stomach anyway.&#34; Consumer added, &#34;I have two stents in my heart and defibrillator.&#34; Consumer was informed. Consumer further added, &#34;I was just asking if you have anybody else report the same thing. I do not think it is an emergency but I do not know if this is bothering somebody else. I will stop taking (incomplete sentence)&#34;. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                On day 3 post shot, I started having strong pain in  the area of my spleen, both front and back.  This was accompanied by occasional chills.  The pain was bad enough that I was not able to sleep on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights after the Tuesday shot.  However, during most of the day Saturday, I was almost pain free. But the pain returned on Sunday  afternoon and I had a difficult sleep .   Monday, the pain level was diminished but did increase by the end of the day.  I took 2 ibuprofin at bedtime and 2 additional when I was awake 4 hours later. Today, Tuesday the pain is minimal, but still present.

A 73-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 73-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 17Feb2021 09:15 (Lot Number: EL3247) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID SHOT) via an unspecified route of administration (reported as injection) at vaccination age of 72-year-old in the left arm (reported as left shoulder) on 26Jan2021 09:00 (Lot Number: EL9262) as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s historical immunizations were reported that the patient never had a flu vaccine in his life before this one and the only other vaccines has ever had were the pneumonia shots and that was years ago. The patient did not receive other vaccine four weeks prior to the first administration of the bnt162b2. The patient received the vaccine in a military facility. The patient reported that he started having (after the second shot) dizziness on 18Feb2021 and pain in his back on 12Mar2021 that kept accelerating until he was admitted in the hospital. The dizziness was ongoing, and he was shaking all the time now, he has had never had the shakes. He added that if he stands up, he gets very dizzy, wobbly, very off balance and starts to drive his blood pressure up on 18Feb2021. He has been checking that twice a day and if he&#39;s up at all and walking around, his blood pressure goes up and his head starts pounding. It&#39;s the same and it&#39;s just wrong. The patient stated that they ran a series of tests, did a spinal tap and found out he had viral spinal meningitis and shingles which he is still experiencing. The wife reported that one of the side effects is that the patient has lost some hearing, so she stated that she was going to help a little. The dizziness began, he&#39;s got it marked down on the day he got his second shot on the 17Feb2021 but further stated he has a note on his sheet that he was busy all day, he believes it was the day after (18Feb2021 but also reported as 17Feb2021), that he began having dizziness. On 13Mar2021, the patient began to have stomach pain and stomach felt hard. The patient stated that his stomach felt hard and has not had a correct bowel movement since then. He added that his stomach and digestive system were not any better, it&#39;s persisting. He mentioned that it started just progressing from his back to his stomach. It started going up and getting in his head and having severe pounding headaches. He has never had a headache, never had a migraine, these were severe. He added that he had to be in a dark quiet room to get any peace and that continued until he got out of the hospital. He also mentioned that he was still having severe pounding headaches from 17Mar2021 they are not as severe as those were. He added that he went to the emergency room on 18Mar2021 because of the severe head problems and lower back problems. They checked him for kidney stones and had x-rays (they were ultrasonic) which they thought maybe he had passed a stone, but there was no evidence of it, other than a distressed left kidney. They scheduled him for another ultrasound on 23Mar2021. He mentioned that his migraines still persisted since 17Mar2021 and when he went back in on the 23Mar2021 for the ultrasound (unknown result), they went back to the emergency room and checked in. They did more tests and they said his white blood count went up to 17,000 and it was obvious his body was fighting something and that&#39;s when they admitted him to the hospital. The reporter stated that after they did the spinal tap on the 26Mar2021 and determined that he had the shingles and the spinal meningitis, they gave him a super dose of some medicine and discharged him home with 10 days-worth of medications that they said would help with his symptoms, but the virus would have to run its course. On Mar2021, the patient also mentioned that he has such hearing loss, ringing in his ears, that&#39;s a factor. The ringing is so loud that it does cut down on the quality of his hearing. He couldn&#39;t hear at all when he got out of the hospital but that has subsided. He stated that the tinnitus, that&#39;s what he thinks it&#39;s called, it&#39;s just non-stop and heavy in his ears. It started while he was in the hospital. He couldn&#39;t hear but didn&#39;t pay much attention to it. It was all muffled, so then when he came out of the hospital, he paid more attention that is was non-stop ringing which was about the same and it hasn&#39;t worsened. The adverse events required emergency room and physician office visit (virtual consult). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement up on an unspecified date in 2021, had multiple computerized tomogram (CAT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but they couldn&#39;t find any problems on an unspecified date in 2021, spinal tap showed spinal meningitis and shingles on 26Mar2021, white blood cell count was 17,000 on 23Mar2021 and x-ray (they were ultrasonic) with results of distressed left kidney on 18Mar2021. He had multiple CAT scans and multiple MRI&#39;s and the MRI was absolutely miserable with his pounding headache, an hour in that machine. Basically, that&#39;s why they had to do the spinal tap because they couldn&#39;t find any problems. The reporter stated that through the blood work they could see it, but with the CAT scans, x-rays, ultrasounds, MRI&#39;s, they all came back with basically nothing on them on an unspecified date in 2021. With the spinal tap, they knew within an hour, they found spinal meningitis and he did have the shingles. There is a big shingles spot on his chest, it was the only obvious thing and the only rash was on his chest. The patient doesn&#39;t remember when he first got the rash on his chest, he had so many electrodes on his body monitoring him, he thought it was one of those sticky things that was irritating him. When someone came in at the hospital, that&#39;s when they saw it. They said oh you have got shingles. The patient stated that it wasn&#39;t painful, he was in enough of other pain. It was about the size of a silver dollar and there&#39;s a little bit of stuff on his back, it goes around like a belt. They saw some little spots on his back, but it never bothered him. The patient reported that it&#39;s a lot better, its healing. He can still see the whole thing, it feels kind of rough and bumpy, but it&#39;s not painful, it&#39;s healing and its improved. The reporter agrees it started sometime in Mar2021 and it is ongoing. The patient mentioned that he was unsure if they did any urine testing, but they took so much blood and stuff, they didn&#39;t tell him anything about that. The events dizziness, back pain, headache, gait unsteady, migraine, meningitis, shingles resulted in hospitalization. The outcome of the events back pain, meningitis and blood pressure orthostatic increased were unknown, as for the events headache and shingles were recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not recovered.

The reporter stated that event on the day of the report, the patient still has the numbness down in his foot, his toe and on his left side but also originally within 4 minutes he was sat down and also within 12 minutes he was throwing up and they could not figure out what was wrong, he did &#34;fall on the ground&#34; (as reported, not further clarified). The patient was experiencing, not as strong but still experiencing, tingly and shingles and originally was numb. The patient is concerned about it. The patient only took the first one because that was on the Saturday and on Monday he went to the doctor and the doctor suggested to not take the second one because his blood pressure turned dropping, he does have the blood pressure and it was 107/70. The reporter said that the patient has allergy and since of that all he had anaphylactic reaction because he is allergic to Penicillin (as reported, pending clarification). He had tingling and shingles after the shot. He was very cold and sweaty and &#34;creepy&#34; (as reported not further clarified). The reporter called the nurse and they took over to have his blood pressure and it was 107/70. The reporter also added that just 4 minutes after the shot he had headache and dizziness and numbness bottom of his left foot and his toe, tingling under his foot and numbness under his toe. The patient did not take any treatment for the events but might take Tylenol for the headache. The outcome of the events his whole left side of his body went numb/still has the numbness down in his foot, his toe and on his left side, shingles, blood pressure turned dropping 107/70, headache and dizziness was not recovered while the outcome of the other events was unknown.

                                                Got the shot on Thursday at 2:00 PM.  Felt fine until next day around 1:00 PM.  Came in from work and had to lay down because I was very tired, upset stomach, low fever, and very weak legs.  All I could do was sleep.  I was sick for 6 or 7 days.   After about 10 days, my feet began to swell and my toes started turning purple and black.  My feet were extremely painful and I was unable to walk.  Over 3 months after the shot I am still having trouble with my feet.

                                                May 20 Had felt &#34;fatigued&#34; most of day - attributed it to having to rise earlier than usual and having not slept well. Evening of 2nd dose date I began to feel somewhat more fatigued. (Had also drank a shot of tequila before dinner and had a glass of white wine with. Was also smoking high quality cannabis in moderation.) At 11:00 pm I rose from my chair having been seated for probably an hour and symptoms hit me full force: chills, the mild soreness in my upper arm became moderate to severe and spread to my shoulder and lower back, whole body particularly joints (including fingers of left hand) aches, mild nausea. Rough night May 21 Symptoms continue with less severity. Especially notice pain in lymph gland areas - armpits, lower back, sides of neck. by evening (with the help of 1/2 Percocet (10/325) I was feeling ok and stayed up til 1:30am May 22 Awake @ 8am. whole body particularly joints still ache including left hand (exacerbated by phone use). Upper left arm &amp; shoulder still sore but mid-back left side more so. May 23 Pretty much back to normal. &#34;Flu symptoms&#34; ran their course. Still have a tough immune system at 73yo apparently (I rarely get sick at all)

It was happening once or twice a day. I was given essential oils to smell twice a day for one minute for 12 weeks. I am in week 8. Now I rarely smell the smell. Also I now have a constant ringing in my head. sounds like a TV was left on after the broadcasting stopped.

He spoke with his PCP and was told to quarantine and report any worsening symptoms. Wednesday or Thursday he began with vomiting and unable to hold down any fluids. His cough was nonproductive. On Saturday 4/17/21 he reported to Hospital ER with SOB, cough, vomiting &amp; diarrhea. He was diagnosed with COVID PNA. He passed away 5/7/21 of COVID PNA, respiratory failure. He tested positive the week of 5/7/21 again of COVID 19. I feel this needs to be reported as he had both PFIZER vaccines in January &amp; February and still ended up intubated and deceased from COVID 19.

                                                Patient did not report this event to the vaccination site for several months, which is why the report is just now being submitted.  Below is the exert from an email that patient sent me.  Upon asking his PCP about the reaction, he was instructed to reach out to the vaccination site to report the event.  &#34;I received my first Pfizer shot on January 28, 2021 at 2:00PM.   felt fine when I left after the fifteen minutes waiting period.  I felt fine when I went to work the next morning.  However, when I returned home from work at about 1:00 PM I did not feel well.  My legs were very weak, upset stomach, headache, rash and some fever.  I stayed on the couch the remainder of Friday and slept,  I slept on Saturday for a total of approximately 22hrs and the same on Sunday.  I went to work on Monday even though I still did not feel very good.  It was several more days until I felt near normal.   About 10 days after the first shot, both of my feet began to swell and my toes began to turn purple and black.  My feet became extremely painful.  I went to the emergency room where they drew blood and said I had gout.  I was given a prescription for a 5 day packet of steroids.   That helped, but my feet reverted back to the swelling and extreme  pain within 1 day of no steroids.  I contacted my primary care doctor who prescribed an additional 10 day packet of steroids plus two other prescriptions that I do not remember.  I was in extreme pain and needed a walker to function.   I have had two follow up visits to my primary care doctor.  He did blood work which showed several results were outside of the normal range, however the gout indicator was within the normal range.  My RA level was 32 which is very high.  And, never have  had my RA factor number high prior to the shot.  He referred me to a RA specialist, but the appointment is still months away.     My feet are still somewhat swollen and walking is very uncomfortable and a little unsteady.  Before the shot, I was doing well.  My blood work was fine.   It has been almost 4 months and I still do not know when my feet will return to normal. I am no longer using a walker.   My Primary Care doctor advised me to report my adverse reactions.&#34;  Patient did received his 2nd Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2/25/2021.  He states he &#34;did not experience any effects from the second shot&#34;.  At this point I am not sure if the COVID-19 vaccine is the culprit with patients RA level, but did want to report this event since patient indicates the timing of the vaccination and his symptoms appear related.

A 73-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 12May2021 11:20 (lot number: EW0173) at the age of 73 years old as 1st dose, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 virus on Jan2021 (completed his isolation and recovery; came out of quarantine on 10Jan2021), ongoing atrial fibrillation (Diagnosed 20 years ago in 2001), ongoing parkinson&#39;s disease (Diagnosed 12 years ago in 2009). There were no concomitant medications. The patient had no history of previous vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No vaccines administered on the same date with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No relevant tests reported. When the patient had the COVID-19 virus in Jan2021, the patient completed his isolation and recovery and then waited the suggested 90 days until he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. After he received his first dose of the vaccine (symptoms began about 12 hours after the shot, at the same time on the evening of 12May2021), he had a &#34;bad reaction&#34; which included fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit, nausea, tiredness and his blood pressure was up so he went to the hospital. The patient was admitted to the hospital for 3 days (from 14May2021 to 17May2021) and then released. He was scheduled to receive the second dose of the vaccine on 04Jun2021 (23rd day after the first dose) and he would like to know if it was advisable to proceed with the second dose or not. The patient wanted to know how effective was receiving only the first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine if he chose to forgo his second dose. The patient stated that he listened to all these people on the news one day, they said to get it, then one day, they said don&#39;t get it. The patient mentioned that they said wait 60 days then they said 90 days, so he had to make a decision and then waited 90 days after he was clear of the virus. The events required a visit to the emergency room but not to the physician&#39;s office. The patient received unspecified treatments as a result of all the events. The patient recovered completely from all the symptoms reported on 16May2021.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

A 74-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 15Dec2020 16:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient has no known allergies. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. He was an ER doctor and the medical director of his hospital. The patient was asymptomatic when he got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. 3 hours after the vaccine he began to get chills, HA, anorexia, myalgias, and extreme fatigue. This worsened and he slept all and had no appetite. On 19Dec2020 he woke up delirious with a fever and was ataxic, hypoxic, incontinent, and confused. The patient was hospitalized due to the events on 15Dec2020. The events also caused prolonged hospitalization due to the events. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient was tested for COVID via nasal swab post vaccination with unknown results. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was not recovered. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events as the patient required oxygen, plasma, and remdisivir.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, BNT162B2, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible causal association between administration of BNT162B2 and the onset of reported serious events might not be excluded, considering the plausible temporal relationship.  Fever, chills, headache, fatigue and muscle pain are the known adverse event profile of the suspect product.  More information such as detailed underlying medical conditions and concomitant medications are needed for fully medical assessment.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

The patient had symptoms start earlier in the day of Tuesday, 09Feb2021, after his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot (04Feb2021). The reporter said she and her husband didn&#39;t think anything of his symptoms at first. The patient had a temperature of 99.4 degrees on 09Feb2021. She didn&#39;t check her husband&#39;s temperature again after that time because the nurse at her husband&#39;s doctor&#39;s office said her husband&#39;s temperature was not at an area of concern. The patient was sweaty, off and on, starting 09Feb2021. She clarified he would be sweaty and the cold, but nothing extreme. The patient developed muscle aches, body aches, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting on 09Feb2021. She clarified her husband had fatigue, tiredness, and had trouble with a raspy throat. His raspy throat started Tuesday evening (09Feb2021). His raspy throat felt like he had mucus stuck in his throat, and he was unable to clear the mucus from his throat. The reporter called her husband&#39;s primary care doctor on the morning of 10Feb2021 because her husband was having trouble with a raspy throat, and difficulty breathing. She said on Tuesday night (09Feb2021) her husband had to sleep sitting up because he couldn&#39;t lay down with his breathing.  He was able to eat breakfast (clarified as oatmeal and an orange), lunch (clarified as soup and a salad), and dinner (clarified as soup and half a sandwich. She said her husband ate all the meat and half of the bread on the sandwich) on 10Feb2021. Her husband&#39;s primary care doctor wasn&#39;t available to speak to on Wednesday morning (10Feb2021), but the doctor&#39;s nurse said it sounded like her husband was having a reaction to his second COVID-19 Vaccine shot. The reporter said her husband&#39;s doctor instructed her later in the day to take her husband to the Emergency Room or Urgent Care if he didn&#39;t feel any better. Her husband&#39;s throat raspiness got worse in the evening of 10Feb2021. His breathing also became worse after dinner in the evening of 10Feb2021. The patient leaned forward over a couple pillows while sitting on their couch as it was easier for him to breath by doing that. They decided at 11:00PM that her husband should go to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was getting very weak, so she and her husband debated if she should call # for an ambulance, or if she should drive him to the Emergency Room. She said her husband was able to dress himself, but with some difficulty, and she assisted walking him from their house to their car. She said she had turned to walk away from her husband while he was at the side of their car, and then she heard her husband make a noise. He had appeared to have passed out. She clarified in the past, her husband had passed out prior to his pacemaker. She said she dialed #, and the # operator told her how to tell if her husband was still breathing. She said she couldn&#39;t tell if her husband was still breathing. She said when the ambulance arrived at her house, the ambulance staff worked on her husband for a long time. The reporter thought her husband had died at the time he had collapsed at the side of their car. The patient took a sugar free cough syrup Tuesday night (09Feb2021), and then again a couple times on Wednesday (10Feb2021) as treatment. The patient had thrown up a couple times, but found that the sugar free cough syrup soothed his cough the night before (09Feb2021). She said her husband had taken 2 TUMS early on Wednesday morning at approximately 2:00AM (10Feb2021). He had said his stomach was bothering him on 10Feb2021. He said he thought he may be constipated, so he took 1 Senokot (Clarified as GeriCare Senna-Plus Natural Vegetable Laxative with Stool Softener) on 10Feb2021. She clarified her husband had diarrhea on 09Feb2021, but felt on 10Feb2021 he may have been constipated. There were no adverse events required a visit to Emergency Room since Patient&#39;s wife stated she was getting her husband to their car, so she could drive him to the Emergency Room, when her husband collapsed and died or to Physician Office as they spoke with the nurse at her husband&#39;s primary care doctor&#39;s office. Weakness was reported as worsened. The outcome of events Sweaty, Cold, Muscle ache, Body Aches, Fatigue/Tiredness, Raspy throat/worsened, Difficulty breathing, Weakness was not recovered; and of the remaining events was unknown. The patient died on 11Feb2021. The patient&#39;s official time of death was Thursday, 11Feb2021, at 12:08AM. Cause of death was unknown. An autopsy was not performed and it would take 3 weeks for a death certificate to be issued. The reporter stated she thought it was important to notify Pfizer of her husband&#39;s passing because his side effects fell within the expected time period after receiving his second COVID-19 Vaccine.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Death

The consumer reported similar events for two patients. This is the first of two reports. A 74-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot no. E10142, via an unspecified route of administration (administered to the left arm) on 19Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose for Covid vaccination administered at facility. Medical history included 100% disabled, Covid from Jul2020, hospitalized from 21Jul2020 to 26Jul2020, blood plasma, and sore. No relevant family medical history relevant to AEs. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. The patient previously took remdesivir. The patient called to report side effects after getting the first Pfizer COVID vaccination. He got it on 19Jan2021. He had COVID before. Last summer he hadn&#39;t left the house for 20 plus weeks and their son who was living with them brought the COVID virus in to them. His son and wife were asymptomatic and suffered at the house and he was completely disabled, with underlying conditions had to drag himself to the facility. He eventually had to be hospitalized on 21Jul2020. He had blood plasma and remdesivir and stayed in the hospital from Tuesday through Sunday. After getting the treatment, he felt like superman. On 20Jan2021, he next day, about 24 hours later he started feeling sick again, he felt like when he had COVID back in Jul2020. It lasted for 24 hours, terrible headache, chills, aches, and a little diarrhea. He said after he got the vaccine, 24 hours later, his arm got sorer and sorer. He had 99.9 F fever and a terrible headache. He also put on a little weight on an unspecified date. No emergency room visit. No relevant tests. He called the facility the next morning and they told him to rest. He slept all day and the next day he felt like superman again. He called the facility that Thursday morning and they instructed him to relax and that it seemed to affect people who have had the COVID virus before, they have that reaction, and it should subside and it did. He stated his side effects were about 20% of what they were when he actually had COVID. The clinic told him that if he had any reaction to call and that Thursday he just relaxed. No other vaccines given the same day or 4 weeks prior. Never had any problems with shots, not really. He remembered when he went to specific area they gave him a whole bunch of shots with these guns and he was just sore a couple days, but that was it, no big deal. The patient underwent lab test which included COVID-19 positive Jul2020. The outcome of feeling sick, headache, chills, ache, diarrhea was recovering while outcome of other events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021107344 Same reporter/drug, similar events, different patient

Immediately I had burning sensation on the upper jaw inside the mouth as if I had drank real hot drink. It felt like the skin on the upper jaw is going to peel off. Then I brushed my teeth and took my tablets. After swallowing I got burning sensation in my Stomach. Both feelings subsided after some time may be half hour.

Then less frequently (bigger intervals - maybe 4 times) till about 5am 3/6/21.  Then it more or less stopped.  Headache left, and though the stomach was worked over, I was now feeling better. Other than a rough night. All this time I had been rehydrating  frequently - trying to keep pace with discharge . . . (fizzy water - no additives) sometimes cut with a very little cranberry juice.  Since then  BRAT and now back to almost normal.   4lb lighter . . . That&#39;s good.

                                                My father complained of heartburn the evening he received his vaccine.  He told my mother he need to sit  down and relax.  My mother walked into the other room to watch some TV while she allowed my dad to relax.  During that time, my mother fell asleep.  She woke up after an hour when she realized my dad was not sitting next to her.  She went to the living room where he was sitting and discovered he was not breathing and passed away.  EMT was called and they said they could not do anything for my dad since he was already gone.

Developed pain in my abdomen area quite noticeable 4 days later.  6 days later had major pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea.  Went to ER morning of the 7th day....spent 4 days in hospital.  Had a blood clot--Portal Vein Thrombosis.  Put on Heparin drip in hospital...and Eliquis blood thinners after released.  I have never been sick like that...never been on any prescription...always been healthy, walking 3-5 miles per day.   My family feels that there must be a connection with the vaccine.  One of my doctors said no...another said didn&#39;t think so, but unknown at this time.

I have 13 foil packets remaining  so I applied one per day for 11 days. Noted that flu symptoms are listed as a side effect of at least one of the dermatology treatments.   Apr 1 Flu (symptoms) continued   Apr 2 Since flu symptoms can indicate covid, I went to prompt care for a rapid covid test.  Negative covid. Except for diarrhea, the flu symptoms moderated. Results from the dermatology treatment became more intense and spread well beyond the area treated.      Apr 3 Took Pepto Bismo tablets for diarrhea.  Seems to have worked. Skin reaction has spread well beyond the treated area.   Applying antibiotic cream twice daily   Apr 6

This 74-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration administered on the arm left on 01Mar2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;maybe I don&#39;t know 6198, it&#39;s GN or EN&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included atrial fibrillation, broken back, breathing problem because of his heart and lung, his lungs have problem, he had some nodules in it, and kidney stone once 25 years ago, 5 little stones. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient had a reaction, it is the worst reaction he has ever had in his life, the pain he had, he was almost paralyzed and couldn&#39;t walk after vaccine and he had to get a wheelchair because he couldn&#39;t stand on his feet. He ended up in the emergency room. The vaccine put him out of work, and now he can work some. He is trying to make it up in two days, today and tomorrow to finish up. He was very upset and wanted to know why this happened to him. The patient stated that other people he talked to had no reaction, if they had a fever or anything it was gone in a coupled days, but he ended up in the emergency room. On 01Mar2021, patient had his first dose and at 02:30, he got out of the facility and came out okay with no problem. At 21:00, all of a sudden he saw that he could not stand up on his feet and he fell awake. He waited in the bed, people around him got worried. Eventually, he asked them to bring wheelchair, maybe he can drive. He drove home with his wife to the emergency from his house and he got admitted in emergency and he was screaming so bad, he did not believe in his life, he never heard somebody doing like this. He felt like somebody getting chills like somebody cutting his side, on his lower abdomen on the right side. It&#39;s underside of the lower abdomen, he had slight pain every single day, sometime excruciating, he took Ibuprofen for it. He thought he had a kidney stone because he had it once 25 years ago, 5 little stones, so they took him to emergency, took him to the CT scan. They didn&#39;t find anything, but the pain was excruciating and in the emergency room everybody thought the crazy man is here who is screaming. He couldn&#39;t control his scream. He couldn&#39;t walk, he couldn&#39;t move. Every movement was like you put a knife on the cutting, it was that bad. His second dose was due on 22Mar2021. He went to the pharmacy and asked them the number and let them know that he had a reaction like this and they called somebody and said to cancel the shot. They cancelled it. That day for 3 days, patient had the pain, it was slowly because he had to take eventually oxycodone. The doctor advised in the emergency room that nothing was wrong, just to slow down the pain but he was not allowed to take the oxycodone. He took the 10 mg oxycodone and the pain which was an hour and a half was a little bit down. After 3 hours, it was a little better, he didn&#39;t want to scream, it was gone but the pain was still there for at least 3 days, really bad. He was taking ibuprofen and a muscle relaxant. He did all those things and still I have the pain left and he did not know what to do with that. The lab test he had, he had been okay, he did not have any problem. He got the result on 22Mar2021. Outcome of the events pain and abdominal pain was not recovered and of the other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

He then arched back and started seizing. He was seated in a walker at the time, went very pale and seized for approximately 30-40 seconds. Emergency services were contacted by store personnel. We laid him down on the ground to decrease his fall risk. Approximately 5 minutes later he was verbal and responsive. EMS arrived and took over. I informed them of his vaccination and daughter relayed his health history. EMS then took patient to preferred hospital for evaluation.

As the day progressed, the pain worsened. On 2/12, I began to be concerned that I had somehow damaged the repair of my left side hernia. So that afternoon I went to urgent care to have it checked. The hernia repairs on both sides were totally intact and the doctor did not speculate on what else it could be but said to watch it and if it worsened, to go to the ER. Into that evening, the pain shifted to the right groin. By the morning of 2/13 the pain had greatly diminished but had shifted again to the left groin. On the morning of 2/14, the pain disappeared.

A 75-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6198, vaccine product manufacture date 24Feb2021 ) intramuscularly in arm (for route of administration: Caller stated the shoulder, caller forgot whether left or right, clarified as shoulder muscle. Caller thought it was in the left shoulder muscle but stated don&#39;t hold him to it. Caller said he was picturing himself sitting down, but didn&#39;t remember if its the right or left arm) on 17Mar2021 13:20 at age of 75-year-old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, two bouts with cancer, heart attack, pneumonia years ago (He said it was 3 or 4 weeks in the hospital when the caller had pneumonia, Caller clarified he was in the hospital for at least 4 weeks and home for 3 or 4 weeks, that&#39;s how bad caller&#39;s pneumonia was. Also the fact the caller is 75 years old, so basically caller&#39;s age and immune system) and a lot of health issues. Other medical history included gastritis. When relevant family medical history was queried caller said it was just like caller said, the pain was just constant. He could not take any kind of Aspirin, Advil or anything like that because caller has severe gastritis. Caller may try something topical cream to see if it would help or not. Caller stated he had Atypical Neuralgia and had not taken anything for the leg pain. Caller&#39;s stomach was extremely sensitive to any type of medication. The only medication the caller took is for blood pressure. If he took any medication it hits his gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal and central nervous system so he didn&#39;t take any prescribed medications other than Atenolol for blood pressure, once a day. Caller took Valium as needed for severe costochondritis, stated between the ribs was cartilage, the Valium was taken as needed. No further information provided. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.

Caller confirms he has not had any adverse event after a vaccination. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Caller stated he knew better than to have any other vaccinations. It was days before that, it was like on a Sunday, caller got an allergy shot, but they said allergy shot was not considered a vaccination. It was an allergy shot for dust, mold, histamines. Caller stated he may have skipped the allergy shot, confirmed caller did not receive the allergy shot. Shot was for mold, histamines and pollen, not a vaccination. No vaccines for flu or Pneumonia or anything else. The patient had problems a week after the first shot of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine, which was already reported to Safety. She had severe muscle pain, soreness and weakness in both legs from thighs to calves all the way down to ankles; not just the typical muscle pain, tiredness, nausea that lasts a day or so. On 24Mar2021, she started experiencing muscle pain and it has gotten progressively worse. She was not sure if she will get the second shot but she would beyond the 42 days; it&#39;s been about 6 weeks and didn&#39;t have an appointment with her rheumatologist until June.The patient talked to a nurse in the FDA. The nurse said there was no time limit to receive second dose Pfizer COVID Vaccine. Although, when the vaccination first came out caller was told the second dose Pfizer COVID Vaccine should be given no more than 6-8 weeks and the nurse was telling the caller the second dose could be given months later. Caller&#39;s first question, if caller decided to go the second dose Pfizer COVID Vaccine was there any time frame between doses that the caller would have to start over again with the Pfizer Covid Vaccinations. Caller received the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 17Mar2021 and was not sure if he will get the second dose because he was experiencing a little bit of a problem and was not sure if it is related to the Pfizer Covid Vaccine dose one or not, caller stated he would get to that. He has a couple doctors appointments, so if they rule it out. Severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs: Caller reported he was having severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs began about a week after receiving first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine. He knew most of the shots they say that you may experience muscle pain nausea and all that. That&#39;s basically it. Caller stated it is a throbbing, sharp pain that was 24/7 and it begun happening within a week after got the first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Experiencing muscle pain in both legs, to thigh to calves to the ankles, 24/7, not coming and going. Caller stated ever since a week from 17Mar2021 this has been happening from 24Mar2021 to the date of report. Severe muscle pain, soreness, weakness in both legs. If caller bends down, he had to put his arm on something to pull himself up. Sharp pain, throbbing, sore and if you pressed down on leg, made it even worse. If the leg was touched anywhere it was just really sore and tender and kind of like a sharp pain. Sharp pain wasn&#39;t as bad as the soreness. Extremely sore and tender 24/7 and hadn&#39;t stopped since 24Mar2021. About the time period it started and hasn&#39;t let up since then. If caller did any kind of work, trying to get muscles back in shape with exercise helps, but if caller did anything putzing around and pulling weeds, bending down exacerbates the problem. Any kind of activity exacerbates the problem greatly. Caller never had this kind of muscle pain. Severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs: Caller reported he was sore in his legs especially the thigh and calf area, down around ankles not too bad. But the thigh and the calf muscles are extremely sore and painful. Caller sated has not gotten any better, if anything may have gotten a little worse. Same or maybe a little worse, honestly, when first came on just felt like a little bit of muscle pain. Initial onset to now it has gotten worse, it hadn&#39;t gotten worse in the last few weeks. The pain was bad lets put it that way. Caller guesses the biggest thing it has a major impact on is his quality of life. Caller has gotten different surgeries and stuff and been able to move on. However, with this the caller was lucky to be able to do anything for half an hour to an hour and then he just has to sit down. Caller stated it was having a major impact on caller&#39;s quality of life. Caller like to have gone but doctor ordered blood work, didn&#39;t want caller to be exposed. Caller was holding off going to emergency room, didn&#39;t want exposure of going to the emergency room. Pain was pretty bad but not to the point of screaming out of caller&#39;s mind. Severe muscle pain and tenderness in both legs: Caller reports throbbing sharp pain in both legs. Chronic fatigue has gotten a lot worse: Caller stated he does have chronic fatigue prior to receiving the Pfizer Covid Vaccine dose one. Chronic fatigue has gotten a lot worse after receiving the first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Noticed two weeks after receiving the Pfizer Covid Vaccine caller felt the chronic fatigue more. Before, caller felt tired all the time, now caller is exhausted if caller does anything for half an hour to an hour, caller has to sit down and falls asleep for awhile. Chronic fatigue has gotten worse in conjunction with leg pain. The chronic fatigue worsening began maybe a couple weeks after receiving the first dose Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Caller stated you have to have Chronic Fatigue to understand. Everyone may be tired and if you want to call it a day they may go home and feel a little tired but with Chronic fatigue sleeping 8 hours a night, REM sleep, wake up and just feel totally exhausted. Some people were worse and can&#39;t get out of bed. He can at least get out of bed but Everything is an effort to move forward with chronic fatigue. Caller&#39;s Chronic Fatigue has gotten worse since receiving the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Whether this is related or not, caller is not in a position to say. Caller states he can report the sequence of events as they happened and let the determination be made. Chronic Fatigue has gotten considerably worse. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are needed; No further information is expected.

                                                Patient is a very pleasant 75y.o. year old  male with a known history of metastatic colon carcinoma currently receiving chemotherapy, presenting to the hospital with complaints of odynophagia and dysphagia with both liquids and solids over the past 2-3 days. Additional complaints included intermittent shortness of breath related to &#34;asthma&#34; - unchanged in character or severity from previously.. He denies any cough, chest pain, fever, chills, sweats. At presentation he was afebrile with stable vital signs and was maintaining an O2 sat of 100% breathing room air. Laboratory revealed a WBC of 40.4 with a predominance of neutrophils on the differential as well as toxic granulation (patient had just recently received Neulasta on 6/17), mild elevation of his alkaline phosphatase of 199 with a normal bilirubin, and normal renal function. CXR was negative for any acute pathology. For reasons that are unclear, testing for SARS CoV 2 by NAA was performed and was positive. The patient has a history of having had Covid in November 2020, and also received vaccination for Covid with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in April of this year. His any recent contact with anyone with Covid 19, and states that he has severely limited travel outside of his apartment to avoid social contact during the pandemic. ID is consulted regarding the above presentation. Significance unclear. This patient has little in the way of symptomatology to support a diagnosis of Covid 19. He had symptomatic infection with SARS CoV 2 in November 2020. Prolonged positive testing for SARS CoV 2 by NAA as been noted for months following Covid 19. In addition, prolonged shedding has been noted in patient&#39;s who are immunocompromised, although I would doubt that is the situation here as he is asymptomatic for Covid 19 (intermittent shortness of breath likely related to his underlying asthma as she is maintaining an excellent O2 sat breathing room air at this time and has a negative CXR). I do not think any therapy for Covid 19 is indicated at this time. Would doubt he is shedding infectious virus, but will continue isolation for now
