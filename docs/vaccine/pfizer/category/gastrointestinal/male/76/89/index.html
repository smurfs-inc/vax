                                                I developed stomach, intestinal pain, cramps. A continuous aching with a sharp pain about every 20 - 35 minutes. Lasting  36 hours. This was in my lower abdomen below belly button on the left side. Really quiet frightening, in that this was not in any material regarding side affects. I considered the emergency room  Saturday night but didn&#39;t t go. Began to subside Sunday afternoon, leaving me sore to the touch. Only a little tenderness remains in the area. I have seen no physicians. I cannot speak to any permanent damage.

                                                Exactly one week following the injection I experienced sudden onset of significant vertigo that required immediate bed rest. There was also minimal nausea and headache, intermittent. Slept well, but had a very difficult time walking from bed to toilet during early morning  due to the symptoms. Slightly improved by 7 AM in the morning. Intermittent episodes of the vertigo during Friday and Saturday, decreasing in intensity. Was able to exercise on stationary bike on Friday and Saturday PM. No symptoms Sunday AM (now). Will symptoms recur?

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 08:40 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient just recently had surgery he had a hernia removed and a week after that; he had the operation done arthroscopically and a week after that; the lower right abdominal area was swollen and he was in a lot of pain and he ended up going to the hospital and they admitted him in the ER and they gave him some Morphine and hooked up to all kinds of stuff and eventually they found out that an artery had been nicked and they went in and fixed that and his hemoglobin has been going up and down. At any rate he had surgery again and they cleaned out all of that blood and they didn&#39;t find any more leaks but the patient&#39;s wife was wondering if it would be okay to have the booster for the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 (Thursday). The patient&#39;s wife confirmed that all of this happened since him having the first dose of the vaccine, but it was not related. The patient&#39;s wife also reported that the patient&#39;s height shrunk, and he was 5&#39;11.75&#34;. The outcome of artery had been nicked was recovered, and unknown for the rest of the events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is no reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to BNT162b2. These are more likely associated with the surgical condition and post surgical complications.

                                                Collapse of lung; Diarrhea; very weak; lost his appetite; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 intramuscular, administered on right arm on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9261) at single dose (at the age of 78 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history included had vascular problems in his legs, and his legs were very clogged. The doctors couldn&#39;t do anything and tried to do a catheterization. Thyroid was not okay, and now his doctor increased his thyroid medication. The reporter blamed the hospital for doing something wrong when her husband was there the last time. She said the hospital made a mistake and gave her husband the wrong medication. She said the first time her husband was at the hospital, the hospital didn&#39;t give her husband his thyroid medicine. She said the second time, the hospital gave her husband the wrong dose of medication. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) dose 1 on 10Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously took flu vaccines in Sep2020. On Mar2021, the reporter&#39;s husband was okay at first. She said now her husband had diarrhea and pooped in his clothes. She said her husband was very weak and lost his appetite. She clarified her husband&#39;s symptoms started probably 2 weeks ago, and her husband was worse, and like a different person now. She said her husband used to eat at the table, and now he just sits in his chair, and after 5:00PM he wants to go to bed. She said she was not sure if her husband&#39;s symptoms were related to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband was supposed to have heart bypass surgery on Monday (22Mar2021), and his surgeon called on Saturday night (20Mar2021) and called off her husband&#39;s surgery. She said the surgeon said her husband had a collapsed lung. She said her husband had a chest x-ray in late Feb2021 and his lungs were clear. She said everything that happened to her husband, happened after he had his second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her husband&#39;s collapsed lung (19Mar2021) was related to his second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, her husband did not have a problem with his lungs. She said her husband&#39;s surgeon can&#39;t figure out why her husband&#39;s lung collapsed. She said she can&#39;t prove his collapsed lung was a side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine, but her husband never had sick lungs in his life. She said she knows her husband doesn&#39;t have the COVID-19 Virus because he had to be tested on Saturday (20Mar2021) for the COVID-19 Virus before he could have his surgery on Monday (22Mar2021). She said her husband&#39;s COVID-19 Virus test was negative Saturday, but he has all these problems. The patient&#39;s wife was afraid to give her husband Pepto Bismol, so she didn&#39;t give her husband anything. She said her husband has an appointment on Thursday (25Mar2021) with his primary care doctor to talk about his symptoms. The outcome of collapsed lung was unknown and other events were not recovered.

                                                Initially mild pain and tenderness Left arm shoulder muscle. On third day after second vaccination,  should symptoms gone but I started to develop diffuse myalgias.  By 4th day, began having problems with my memory. I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms.

An 80-year old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 07:00AM (vaccine location: Arm, Left Upper) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing parkinson&#39;s disease (probably had Parkinson&#39;s disease for 8 years, but was formally diagnosed 6 years ago) and peripheral neuropathy. The concomitant medications was reported as sinemet for parkinson&#39;s disease and gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy, about 6 years. Patient said 36 hours after having his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, he had massive diarrhea on 14Jan2021 at 04:00PM. He said the diarrhea only happened one time. He said he went on a BRAT diet for a few days and then back to a regular diet. He clarified the diarrhea was brown. He said he had 1 incident of blood in his stool after that on 15Jan2021. He said he couldn&#39;t get an appointment with his doctor, so he went to emergency room. He said he was at the emergency room from 8:00AM-4:00 PM. He said the emergency room doctor told him he probably didn&#39;t have any recurrence of blood in his stool, because the blood was caused by his episode of diarrhea the day before. He said the emergency room doctor postulated that his diarrhea was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine because there was a 36-hour delay between receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine and having diarrhea. The outcome of diarrhea was recovered on 14Jan2021. The outcome of blood in stool was recovered on 15Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EK9231; expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 19Jan2021 11:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high cholesterol and blood pressure abnormal from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included propranolol hcl for blood pressure and an unspecified cholesterol pill. The patient previously received influenza (Flu shot) on an unspecified date (years) ago for immunization and experienced light headed. The patient reported that his blood pressure went up the day he hook the vaccine to 200/93 and he was real concerned about that. He took a blood pressure pill and was having some sharp pains in his right eye (he had 3-4 at different times). He was anxious feeling and could hear it blowing in his ears (which happens when his blood pressure is high). He stated he has never had his blood pressure that high and has never had any heart problems.

Its location was mid-chest (near the heart).  It was moderate at first but became more intense with time.  By around 6 PM, Feb. 24, the pain was still building, but had migrated lower in my torso closer to my stomach.  The pain reached a peak around 3 AM,  Feb. 25, 2021.  and from that time kept diminishing until it was essentially gone by about 6 PM on Feb. 25, 2021.  Even at its worst, the pain was not so intense that I felt I needed medical treatment.  I always felt during this episode that the pain was completely manageable.

He know it is not supposed to be that long. He could not sleep for two days. His face and palms got really red. He did not have a fever. He walked the floor and only slept 2 hours in two days. On 31Mar2021, he goes to a pain center and got shots in his neck. He asked the doctor if his shot had anything different than he had been getting and he confirmed that it was no different. He never had a reaction before the one he got on 31Mar2021, and thought it may have been the virus shot. He said one other thing happened and is not sure if it had anything to do with it or not. He just started to feel worse and worse. Today is the first day he felt better. He is 80 and has not been this sick. It got really bad but today it is much better. He did not sleep for two days and last night he slept and feels better. For the indigestion, it got worse before it got better. For constipation, he got relief last night and that is why he feels better today. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required- He had a previously scheduled office visit for pain center. The outcome of the events was recovering. The event insomnia was assessed by the reporter as medically significant.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Developed watery diarrhea; malaise; weight loss; collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). An 81-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included allopurinol (ALLOPURINOL), losartan potassium (COZAAR), tadalafil (TADALAFIL), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN), simvastatin (ZOCOR). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 details: (Product= COVID 19) for covid-19 immunisation, Lot number= EL1284, Administration date= 31Dec2020, administration time= 11:00 AM, vaccine location: Left arm, dose number= 1, Developed watery diarrhea about 5 days after the dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. Adverse event: watery diarrhea improved somewhat but worsened again after the second dose of vaccine, along with some malaise and weight loss, since 05Jan2021. Extensive investigations eventually revealed collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies in Jan2021. May well be coincidence, but interested to know if others have been reported. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Anti-diarrheals, budesonide. The event outcome of collagenous colitis was recovering, watery diarrhea was  not recovered, outcome of other event was unknown. Covid test post vaccination covid test date=19Jan2021, which was negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies and bnt162b2 cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Parkinson&#39;s disease from an unknown date. The doctor told him to make an appointment with his Parkinson&#39;s doctor and tell him, maybe that has something do with it. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced burning when he urinates for 2 weeks, a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach on Jan2021. He was wondering if it could be from the shot or if it is something else. He had an appointment with his doctor on Monday and he told him about it. The doctor gave him an antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg that made him dizzy, he does not know if he will continue to take it but it helped the burning, the burning was not as bad. It was in a brown clear pharmacy bottle. The burning when he urinated is going away but the pain in his stomach comes and goes and it is right on his navel, it was described as a real hard pain. Patient would come back 03Feb2021 per vaccination card. Outcome of the event burning when he urinates was recovering while unknown for a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach. The events were considered non-serious.

                                                Diarrhea; his arm was a little sore; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). An 82-year-old male patient received his first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3247; expiration date: unknown) at the vaccination age of 82-year-old intramuscularly in the left arm on 25Jan2021 14:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination (COVID-19 immunization). The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were none. The patient did not received other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to vaccination. The wife reported that her husband got the first dose of the Covid-19 Vaccine on 25Jan2021 about 14:00 and did not have any reaction except his arm was a little sore on 25Jan2021 18:00. It is sore if he rubs the area, but has gotten better She said that last night, he developed diarrhea at about 22:30 26Jan2021. She inquired if this is a coincidence, he got the diarrhea or is it a side effect from the shot. She added that the diarrhea started about 36 hours after he got the first dose. He had the diarrhea at 22:30 26Jan2021, he had it again at 02:00 27Jan2021, and again at 07:00 27Jan2021 and he has not had it since. She said that her husband was saying he thinks it was getting better. She mentioned that after he received the vaccine, they waited for 15 minutes to make sure there was no reaction. She added that the vaccination facility type was health department drive through vaccination. The adverse events did not require emergency room or physician office visit. The outcome of the event was recovering.

The headache gradually improved after the initial injection and he only has a little headache left currently. Patient had a headache the first couple of days, it was real light until now, he was still kind of not back to normal.

He got sick and was heaving for 7 hours, then he was dry heaving after throwing up so much, it was green bile. He knew he was getting dehydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte at 7pm that night. He had to stay a half hour after getting the vaccine since they wanted to monitor him a little longer since he takes blood thinners an other crap.

I just feel super weak but not like if you have corona. Now, I can sleep under oxygen and it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore and when I get up I don&#39;t need oxygen anymore and I can breathe freely.&#34; Wanted to know how long will his symptoms last. He was as weak as a rag, has a little fever that comes and goes, does not go over 101, stated he was taking Eliquis does not know if that was important or not, slept with oxygen but has not had any trouble breathing. Wondering if this was standard. The action taken for apixaban was unknown. Outcome of the event &#39;didn&#39;t have appetite&#39; was unknown and not recovered for the other events.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

Family heard a thud in pt&#39;s bedroom and found him on the ground with left gaze. EMS called, placed pt on a C-collar and brought to ED as a stroke code activation. On presentation, pt with left gaze and right hemiparesis and LLE weakness. He was non-verbal and not following commands. Head CT showed no acute hemorrhage. CTA with perfusion did not show a large vessel occlusion or significant hypoperfusion. Clinical picture suspicious for ictal event so he admitted to the NSICU for further workup.

                                                right hand swelling, right knee swelling, right ankle swelling, facial swelling of left cheek Narrative:  Following 1st COVID-19 vaccine dose on 12/17/20, patient seen at Emergency Department on 12/21/20- 12/22/20 for eval of new left cheek swelling and right hand/ankle swelling. Hand x-ray did not show signs of fracture, head CT did not show any signs of new strokes, and labs showed mild BNP elevation. Per ED note, &#34;Based on the patient history, physical, and initial vital signs - the patient&#39;s initial presentation is concerning for heart failure/volume overload-&gt;pulmonary edema and bilateral pedal edema.&#34; He received ipratropium neb x1 and returned to facility. Neurology consulted (12/22/20), &#34;It is difficult to determine whether the patient has a new facial palsy or whether this is recrudescence of his previous stroke deficits. Given the swelling of his left face it is quite possible that there is inflammation causing some partial left facial nerve dysfunction that would not include the forehead. The pattern of weakness is, however, also consistent with what would be expected from his documented right MCA stroke. At this point it is appropriate to consider this a possible complication of his vaccination (Bell&#39;s palsy has been reported in some after Covid19 vaccination). However, I would not recommend any specific treatment for the facial weakness as the etiology is still somewhat unclear.&#34; Patient admitted to hospital 1/2/21-1/8/21 for mild hypothermia with possible AMS and found to have adenovirus. Head CT negative for CVA. Sepsis/toxic/metabolic w/u was unrevealing. Given IVF for diarrhea; C diff negative. Discharged to facility. Patient received 2nd COVID-19 pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21 in Right Deltoid w/o complications (lot#: EK9231, exp. 04/30/2021)

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                Patient vaccinated with first dose of Pfizer with subsequent infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Initial H&amp;P reads in part as,  &#34;Patients symptoms began on or around Thursday 3/11 when he began to feel  fatigued. After two days of fatigue, he presented to an urgent care facility on  Saturday 3/13. He was noted to have a fever there and was diagnosed with a  presumed UTI, though patient reports at bedside that he has not had any  dysuria. He was treated with nitrofurantoin and increased his furosemide  temporarily per urgent care&#39;s recommendations. He then presented to the ER  on 3/15 with continued fatigue and a low blood pressure at home. We were unable  to clarify the method by which the blood pressure measurement was obtained  and/or if it was repeated. Antibiotics were changed to cephalexin at that time  despite a relatively clear UA. His daughter brought him back to the ER today  (3/18) due to persistent issues with low grade fevers in the 100-100.5 range,  significantly worsening fatigue, anorexia, and oxygen levels of 92-93% on  nonproductive cough. Does not have a home O2 requirement. In addition, he  endorses feeling chilled during the admission evaluation. Denies any chest pain,  nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, constipation. # Fever Progression of symptoms from Saturday 3/13 may constitute original presentation  of Covid-19. Presentations on 3/13 and 3/15 with dyspnea and fatigue. Initially  thought to be UTI and was treated with nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. UA on 3/15  in ED was negative for leuk esterase and nitrites. Tested positive for covid-19  on 3/18 with lymphopenia, 90-92% on room air. No home O2 req. Given duration  of symptoms and worsening fatigue and fevers, will admit for treatment of Covid- 19. Also considered CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation as explanations for  dyspnea. Possible CHF exacerbation as well given 1&#43; bilateral pitting edema to  mid-shin and JVD to ear lobe. Suspicion for COPD is low given no report of  increased sputum production and questionable history in chart to begin with.  Would be beneficial to clarify history with collateral history 3/19.&#34;

                                                My Father had been in his usual state of health when he received his first Pfizer Covid-19 shot on 1/12/2021 and his second dose on 2/2/2021.  He complained of being tired and chills on 1/13/2021 and again on 1/20/2021.  He was diagnosed with a UTI and placed on antibiotics on 1/27/2021.  After the second covid-19 shot on 2/2/2021 my father had a change in his condition on 2/4/2021.  He became very lethargic, more confused and unable to speak and was send to the Hospital.    He spent from 2/4/2021 to 2/12/2021  in the hospital being treated for a UTI and also was said to have had a Transient Ischemic Attack.  He went to a rehab facility for Physical Therapy from 2/12/2021 to 2/19/2021 after which he returned to the Assisted Living Facility.
