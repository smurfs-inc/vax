This was in my lower abdomen below belly button on the left side. Really quiet frightening, in that this was not in any material regarding side affects. I considered the emergency room  Saturday night but didn&#39;t t go. Began to subside Sunday afternoon, leaving me sore to the touch. Only a little tenderness remains in the area. I have seen no physicians. I cannot speak to any permanent damage.

Then a week ago I came down with what appeared to be an intestinal bug. My subjective sense is that my immune system got confused and is now mounting random immune reactions  - chills and fever, severe back pain, diarrhea, etc.

Next morning 3/25, woke up and tried to get out of bed.  Legs were so weak they gave out and I fell out of bed on the floor.   I had no strength to get back up to get on the bed.  My wife could not lift me, so she called 911 for a &#34;lift assist&#34;.  Paramedics were told I received the 2nd dose of the Covid vaccine the day before, so they picked me up off of the floor and put me back in bed.  They took my vitals - blood pressure was 116/73 and temperature was still 102.6.  Paramedics offered to take me to the hospital but I refused.  Paramedics told my wife that if my breathing became labored, she should get me to the ER or call 911 again.    I was not able to get out of bed the whole day on Thursday 3/25, because I was so weak I could not stand up, and I also had body aches and had to use a urinal because I could not walk to the bathroom.  My wife gave me Tylenol and the fever finally broke late evening of Thursday 3/25 and I started to feel a little bit better.  I had not eaten all day, but my wife made sure I stayed hydrated with water.  On Friday morning 3/26 I was able to sit up on the side of the bed, and I was able to walk with the assistance of a cane to the bathroom.  Extreme fatigue affected me all day Friday, but I did feel better.  Fever did not come back after it broke.  Saturday 3/27 - still experiencing extreme fatigue, but feel better overall.

On an unspecified date Feb 2021, the patient experienced this is different feeling than what he normally feels. The reporter stated, Yes, he takes a lot, I would rather not because its lot he is diabetic and he takes blood thinner and statin and its very long list, but these are different so those, the reason I called because this is different feeling than what he normally feels when he gets ups in the morning, and that&#39;s why I thought maybe it because of Covid. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included glycosylated hemoglobin, diabetes, I do I have to look up the result and the date, the date was 30Jan and it was blood draw for his A1C. The outcome of event different feeling than what he normally feels was unknown and other outcome of the events was not recovered.

A 76-years-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE: Solution for injection), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 25Dec2020 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9261; Expiration Date: 31May2021) as single dose for an unspecified indication. Medical history included myocardial infarction from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (He had 2 heart attacks and open heart surgery and he is sick of this already), cardiac operation from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (He had 2 heart attacks and open heart surgery and he is sick of this already) rhinorrhoea from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 28Dec2020, the patient experienced diarrhea, stomach aches, he&#39;s got the shakes, his right back, shoulder and back of his neck, his legs, his trunk of his body are sore, everywhere his muscle are sore. Patient says the 25th of last month, 25Dec he got his first shot, that was 14 days ago and 3 days after he got diarrhea it was pretty severe but then that cleared up and he was ok for few days and then he got stomach aches, the stomach aches woke him up at 5o&#39;clock in the morning and then he had the stomach ache 03Feb. It was 3 times he had the stomach aches. Today he&#39;s got the shakes but he also has Parkinson&#39;s so a lot of things amplify his Parkinson&#39;s, so he is not overly concerned about the shaky thing. shaky thing happens periodically to him but it is pretty bad today. What he did to rectify is he took his normal medicine and he has taken an antacid on those days when he had the stomach ache and one other thing, the second thing was the stomach aches and also his right back, shoulder and back of his neck, his legs, his trunk of his body are sore, everywhere his muscle are sore and he is having a runny nose, the runny nose is the last thing but at the same time the runny nose was happening prior to taking the shot so that might not be related. He is calling to see if those things are associated with the vaccine. During that time period of time he took his temperature and he did not have a fever at any time. The action taken in response to the events for bnt162b2 was not applicable. The outcome of events was unknown.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. A 76-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 intramuscular on 25 Feb 2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6198) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization administered at clinic. Medical history included hypertension, blood cholesterol increased, myocardial infarction, colon cancer (had surgery for that and also had chemotherapy), coronary artery disease (30% blocked coronary artery), covid-19 from 19May2020 to an unknown date. Concomitant medication(s) included lisinopril for hypertension; amlodipine; rosuvastatin for blood cholesterol increased; evolocumab (REPATHA), subcutaneously at 140 mg (twice a month) for blood cholesterol increased. The patient reported, he was diagnosed positive with COVID-19 on 27May2020 from which he seem to have recovered without any residues of symptoms or side effect. He received first Pfizer COVID vaccination at noon time this past Thursday 25Feb in a vaccination clinic set up, the following day Friday the 26 he woke up the next morning and entire body was so sore from head to toe and could hardly get himself out of bed, but when he got up, he was having difficulty walking, so anyway he stayed in bed all day on 26 and 27. He initially had a slight temperature, some chills, slight cough, runny nose and those symptoms except for the cough seem to have resolved, what hasn&#39;t resolved is about every 30 or 40 minutes or so he had been having to urinate ever since 26Feb2021 night, his mouth has been constantly very dry. Still urinating every half hour 45 minutes and ongoing. Mouth has been very dry and had a couple of areas where it seems like maybe he had bit his lip or something, maybe when he was sleeping. It was nothing like that in mouth anymore but the mouth is still constantly so dry like dehydrated and no matter how much of fluid he drank that doesn&#39;t seem to help it and what in fact has also caused was on yesterday morning he had been a little constipated on Friday night and then yesterday morning had a severe case of diarrhea. Now he had not had another bowel movement since yesterday morning as no appetite and feeling so lousy, and so tired and fatigued. He had been feeling even much worse since getting the vaccine. He still feels very fatigued, very sore all over, very tired, still have the slight cough and he would say that&#39;s about it. Outcome of events for cough, pain and tiredness was not recovered and for the rest of the events it was unknown. No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

Treatment team COVID-19 virus infection Principal problem HPI: For complete history and physical see the H&amp;P dictated by Dr. on 4/28/2021.  This is a 76-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with upper respiratory symptoms for three days.  He reports having cough, sneezing, runny nose and poor appetite.  His caregiver had Covid recently and he was exposed.  He was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.   Hospital Course:  Patient was admitted inpatient to the medical surgical floor.  He was not on telemetry.  Patient reports that his caregiver had recently tested positive for Covid and he was exposed.  He has been having upper respiratory symptoms including cough, sneezing, and runny nose.  His COVID-19 test was positive.       He was started on the COVID-19 treatment protocol which included IV remdesivir and IV dexamethasone.  He underwent a CT scan of the chest which showed small patchy areas of groundglass infiltrates in the peripheral portions of the left and right upper lobes and also the posterior aspects of the right lung base.  These findings are probably due to pneumonia.        Hospital course consisted of gentle hydration with IV normal saline.  He was also started on antibiotic therapy oral azithromycin and IV Rocephin.  He had completed the course of antibiotics while on the unit, therefore, at the time of discharge no antibiotics were prescribed.  He initially was hypoxic and started on nasal cannula oxygen to maintain pulse oximetry greater than 92%.  Eventually, oxygen was weaned and pulse oximetry on room air has remained in the 95-96% range.       He has a history of diabetes mellitus and while on the unit blood glucose levels have fluctuated.  His point-of-care glucose have been in the 80-500 range.  He has had numerous episodes of hypoglycemia and insulin has been adjusted.  The fluctuations of the blood glucose levels may be secondary to IV dexamethasone.  At the time of discharge he will continue dexamethasone 6mg daily for the next three days.  He was advised to increase insulin 70/25 insulin five units daily for the next thre days.  After that time he can return to his normal dose of insulin.  He also had been treated with IV remdesivir and had completed the 5-day course.      On examination today he has been asymptomatic.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting.  The initial lab studies showed an elevated creatinine level, although he has a history of chronic kidney disease.  At the time of discharge the creatinine level trended downward and he was advised to follow-up with the primary care provider for possible repeat BMP in 1 to 2 weeks.  All other lab studies have been within normal limits.        The systolic blood pressure has been in the 120-150 range.  The most recent systolic blood pressure was 151/66 mmHg with a heart rate of 66 bpm.  He denies any lightheadedness or dizziness.  He was advised to continue all of his current medications.  While on the unit he was in isolation secondary to COVID-19.  At the time of discharge he should maintain social distancing/isolation, mask wearing and good handwashing.  He will will need to follow-up with the primary care provider.  He was also advised if the oxygen level dips below 89% he will need to return to the emergency department.  At this time he is resting comfortably, offers no complaints and is stable for discharge.       Patient is alert, oriented answering all questions appropriately.  He is continent of bowel and bladder.   Heis able to make his own decisions.  He is able to performhis own ADLs.  .

                                                I had a severe reaction to my 2nd Pfizer shot with projectile diarrhea for 3&#43; days! This seems unlikely since it occurred 9 days after the shot but there&#39;s no other explanation. This left me so dehydrated that I went into AFIB and had to visit Emergency Room.

The surgeon who took care of my rectum - his office ordered a stool sample. I picked it up and took it back the same day - positive result for C Difficile - oral solution of Vancomycin - 2.5 ml every 6 hours for 10 days. I see the surgeon for the post op check on July 13th and maybe he&#39;ll re-test at that time.

A 77-year-old male patient received BNT162B2  (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient woke up and had  severe acid reflux, trouble breathing for about 15 minutes, couldn&#39;t catch his breath, was wheezing and sounded like an asthma attack.  He felt like something was stuck in his throat. It cleared in 10 seconds and he could breathe and swallow fine.  He took a Benadryl as treatment and drank water.  He also felt tired. The patient further reported that he had the covid vaccine shot. He did not know if he was having a reaction, but he was taking a nap, and he guessed he regurgitated. He had a difficult time catching his breath, it was like it was stuck in the throat. He vomited lying down. He felt the stomach acid come up into mouth after he was able to breath better. But before he was not breathing at all. This never happened before. He was lying flat, he guessed he threw up. He had a large lunch, maybe too large. It was like he was getting something caught in in throat. The patient also reported that his throat was burning and mentioned that he slept on a triangular pillow. The outcome of the events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected. Information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EN6202 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Feb2021 16:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma and stage 4 kidney disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 27Feb2021 (Saturday), patient was not feeling well and on 28Feb2021, he had diarrhea, chills, shaking all over, severe headache and started throwing up. Reporter stated patient had all the symptoms of the reactions and then &#34;you go again to the serious, more dangerous symptoms, he has all of them&#34;. Throwing up, fever, chills, diarrhea and then he get real hot and then he started sweating and it was another day on 01Mar2021. On Monday (01Mar2021), reporter called to take patient to the hospital with high fever. The ambulance put him on IV and oxygen right away. They gave him fluids and were monitoring everything because he was dehydrated and then he stayed in the hospital for some time. He had x-rays, they monitored his blood pressure and heart rate, and the doctor was concerned about his heart rate and blood pressure. Doctor decided to check his urine and he did and he had a UTI on 01Mar2021, and so he gave him antibiotics for that (treatment unspecified). Patient seemed to be better after having the fluids and everything so they let him come home. During the night on 01Mar2021, he had another attack and it was the same thing that he had before. The shaking and the chills the fever and throwing up and the doctor said that it was a reaction from having the vaccination and reporter just wanted to report that he did and reported actually thought he was going to die. Reporter tried to call again the ambulance since she thought that he was not going to make it. The doctor put on the report and he did not put on there that he was in there because of suspected of (incomplete sentence) and then told the reporter himself that he had a reaction from the vaccine. The report stated that patient was in for a UT, but the reporter stated that, once does not call an ambulance for a UTI and she (reporter), have UTI&#39;s all the time. After the reporter got the patient home, he was even much worse. Patient could not breathe and he was struggling to breathe on 01Mar2021. He was shivering, shaking, having diarrhea, throwing up, soaking wet, and she had to change his clothes twice, and his fever was 103.1 F around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning of 02Mar2021. The pharmacist gave medicine for vomiting. Reporter called the hospital and the nurses were busy and they could not take it so 24 hour nurse called. She was finally able to get him comfortable enough that she didn&#39;t have to call again. She thought she was going lose him. She said she felt twice he was going to die, when she called. At the hospital they told him he was having a severe reaction to the vaccine but also had a UTI and they gave him antibiotics. Patient contacted her nephew who is a medic in the military and RN and he said patient has Covid and thinks reporter has Covid too because the virus was in the vaccine. The nephew explained that patient just could not fight it off and said the vaccine acts like that. It made sense because it is inhibit in it then your body will learn to fight it off, like if you come in contact with it and that makes sense but the woman never explained. The nephew further stated to reported that patient&#39;s immune system or whatever was not able to fight it off. So, he said he has to have Covid and when patient heard that after all they had fought to stay away from it and then what were they supposed to do. Patient got the vaccine and ended up with it and that is what reporter have found out and it was very disturbing. Patient was running a 103.1 earlier on the night of 02Mar2021. He was moaning a little bit on Mar2021. Reporter thought patient had severe allergic reaction to the vaccine because he had all the symptoms and stated there was no doubt in her mind (referring to it being an allergic reaction) as it was too soon after the vaccine. Outcome of the event of dehydration was recovering, while for the remaining events was unknown. Reporter was asking if patient should take the second shot.

At first, I attributed this to a weight management plan that I am on, but late recalled the symptom described in my covid response reporting texts.  I Have yet to receive a Covid update text today, so I am submitting this report.  I am scheduled to see my PCP tomorrow.

A 77-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in the left arm on 19Feb2021 08:40 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included atrial fibrillation (Afib) about 10 years ago (2011). Concomitant medication included unspecified medications including blood thinner and Afib medications. The patient takes 6 medications: some of those medications for 40 years, some for a bit less. There were a couple more added for his heart because 10 years ago he had a case of Afib and the doctor who has now retired took him from 3 meds to 6; and has had no issues for the last 10 years. The patient had his first dose on 19Feb2021 at a clinic and was due/scheduled for his second on 12Mar2021. The patient had severe reactions to the first one so he wanted to know if he should accelerate second shot or stay within three weeks. His reaction was for the first two weeks, he had severe nausea, etcetera, which was getting better that week. He gives 20-minute presentations each morning and the participants in the presentation were nice about it but they say that the patient has fog and thought he should see if he should go in sooner as they were worried about him. His only symptoms remaining after two weeks of severe reactions was that he was very sleepy. All that was left was being tired and mentally in a bit of fog (also reported as mental fog). The patient only had pain to the injection site for a day and was not an issue, then it didn&#39;t take long for him to start getting extremely tired and have nausea. He says all he knows was that from the sheet listing severe reactions, he had every one during the first couple weeks (unspecified), though he never had a fever. He says this week he felt better and he was starting to eat, this was not normal for him to be tired all the time, but at least he was not sick. He says he didn&#39;t treat the pain or nausea, because he was healthy as a horse, and has no problems with a vaccine, shots don&#39;t bother him other than having soreness the first day. The patient was just foggy and tired. The patient was recovering from nausea. The patient recovered from injection site pain on 20Feb2021. The patient has not recovered from mental fog/bit of fog and tired. The outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

A 77-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 24Feb2021 (Lot number was not reported) at the age of 77 years, as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included BNT162B2, dose 1 on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. On an unspecified date the patient experienced spiking of his blood pressure, sore arm, legs swollen, pain on one leg, on and off nausea, not feeling right.  The patient had lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: 190/80.  The clinical outcome of the events was unknown. The clinical course was reported as follows: 77-year-old caller reported receiving his second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 24Feb2021 and experienced a &#34;sore arm&#34; after. He explained that a week after vaccination, on the Monday, he &#34; woke up with his legs swollen and pain on one leg&#34;. He stated he also experienced spiking of his blood pressure (BP), however on Monday 03Mar2021 he went to the ER since his BP rose over 190/80. He explained at the ER, he guessed they got him more call, and he received a prescription of &#34;water pills&#34; to take for &#34;a couple weeks&#34;.  He added then, there were moments when he &#34;didn&#39;t feel right&#34;. He specified he would be &#34;good&#34; in the morning then he &#34;just didn&#39;t feel right&#34; in the afternoon. He reported about a month later, 13Apr2021 he had a &#34;second incident with the spiking&#34; of his BP, which led him to the ER. He explained his cardiologist then changed his amlodipine prescription to &#34;5mg in the morning and 5mg at night&#34;. He explained he would take 1 pill of Amlodipine 10mg in the morning before vaccination. He added he would take 5mg of amlodipine for a year before being increased to that 10mg a day.  He explained before vaccination, he &#34;never experienced such spiking with his BP and considers himself healthy for his age. DSU agent reported his BP is generally around 120/70 and he routinely use the treadmill. He mentioned he now seems ok, has not have a &#34;violent&#34; BP spike, but has &#34;not felt 100%&#34; yet. He added some days he is &#34;fine&#34; and others he has &#34;on and off nausea&#34; or he &#34;feels his legs are swollen in the evening&#34;. The main reason for his call is to see if Pfizer have any experience with people who have covid, the long haulers, with the effects for quite a while, that are 3 months in. He was wondering whether or not any long hauler folks that have had on and off side effects attributed it to the vaccine.    Information about Lot Batch number has been requested.

A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN9581), via unspecified route of administration on 06Feb2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The relevant medical history included gout. Concomitant medications included colchicine for gout and a lot of unspecified medications. The patient took a COVID vaccine yesterday and this morning he was bleeding through the &#39;raw&#39;, it came out from his rectum through feces on 07Feb2021. He stated that the next shot was between 27Feb and 19Mar (Clarification unknown). So it was one day between those two days. He said he still was just a little bit, not like he was. No treatment was received for the event. The outcome of the event was recovering.

A 78-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, batch/lot number: EL3248) injection to upper left arm just below shoulder at approximately on 29Jan2021 10:00 at age of 78 years old at single dose for vaccination. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. Relevant medical history included: for ongoing asthma and adult onset maybe 25-28 years ago. He did not have when he was a kid. He did not have allergies. Part of problem was lives in an area that had a very high allergy problem; a lot of people in that area have allergies; for sleep apnea, used CPAP machine; for diabetes from 2006 and onset date approximate. A1C is where doctors want it to be. Went through half a dozen pills and stuff for diabetes that worked for short time and stopped: Names/Lots/NDCs/Expiries: Unknown, does not have this information to provide. He was pretty good at judging carbohydrate content in meals to make adjustments to Humalog and Toujeo dosing as needed; for ongoing overweight, weight gain started after oral injectable product for diabetes stopped working, he went on different insulin product and gained 30-35 lbs. Oral injectable product: name/lot/NDC /expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide. Different insulin product: Name/Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, does not have product or this information to provide; modestly high blood pressure; history of intestinal blockages (occurred quite some time ago, no continuing); had operations in the past. The adverse events (AEs) following prior vaccinations: Adverse Event: He was pretty sure he hit the floor before the needle was even out of his arm when he was administered gamma globulin vaccine which he thinks was around year 1972. The company he worked for at the time had a hepatitis break out, a couple of employees had hepatitis, so they had him receive the gamma globulin vaccine. Vaccine/Brand Name: Gamma globulin vaccine/brand name unknown, whatever it was that was available for hepatitis at the time which he thinks would have been 1972. He is pretty sure in those days they used horse serum in the gamma globulin vaccine; the doctors at the time felt pretty sure that the reaction was to the horse serum aspect of the gamma globulin vaccine. Lot/NDC/Expiry: Unknown, he does not have product or this information to provide. Vaccination Date: Thinks would have been in 1972, further details unknown. Patient&#39;s Medical History (including any illness at time of vaccination) Provide other relevant medical history including but not limited to these conditions: diagnosed allergies, compromised immune status, respiratory illness, genetic / chromosomal abnormalities, endocrine abnormalities (including diabetes) and obesity: All relevant information documented in formal fields of other conditions. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was reported as none. There was no history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). There were not any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. He was supposed to have the Shingrix vaccine but decided to hold off on that until after he got the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. He had the Flu vaccine around Sep2020 or Oct2020 when the senior version came out. Ongoing Concomitant medications included: losartan 100mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure, furosemide (LASIX) 20mg daily from 2019 for high blood pressure causing some fluid buildup, fenofibrate 134mg daily for years for triglycerides, finasteride 5mg daily for years for benign prostatic hyperplasia, multivitamins, boosters of other vitamins (advised by PCP since COVID pandemic started), insulin lispro (HUMALOG) fast acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes, insulin glargine (TOUJEO) slow acting insulin taken as needed for diabetes. It was reported patient stated, he had his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago Friday 29Jan2021 at 10am. He had a sore shoulder and fatigue. At midnight he suffered abdominal cramping by 7am. He took himself to the ER and called his doctor who met him there. He had an intestinal blockage. His peristalsis shut down. He spent a couple days on an NG tube, had x-rays and imaging study, they found a small bowel blockage. It seemed very coincidental within 18 hours of the vaccine. He had them when he was younger. His physician who was an GI specialist said he had 2-3 other patients with similar reactions. He spoke to the safety team regarding this. He was due for his 2nd vaccine a few weeks. Right now his bowels were very irritated, not consistent to bowel movements. He was still on a low fiber diet. Asked if there was any evidence people are having gastrointestinal reaction. He had had blockages in the past, that was his weakness. Asked what to do about 2nd dose. He had asthma, diabetes type 2, mildly hypertensive. This consumer had his first dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine 29Jan2021 at approximately 10:00. On 29Jan2021 at about 23:30, he had went through usual drowsiness and took a nap. Around midnight 00:00 30Jan2021 he started having abdominal cramps that became very severe. He was taken to the Emergency Room where he was admitted to the hospital from 30Jan2021 until discharged home evening of 03Feb2021. Severe abdominal cramps: His peristalsis stopped, just shut down. As a result he had an intestinal blockage. He had nasogastric tube placed for 4 days. He was scheduled for surgery with a gastrointestinal surgeon who he happens to know personally. He had called that gastrointestinal surgeon before he was admitted to the hospital. The gastrointestinal surgeon thought he heard some sounds, so he delayed the surgery. That night the intestinal blockage broke up. He was discharged from the hospital before they normally would have released him to get people out as quickly as possible due to risk of contagion in hospitals. Both he and the gastrointestinal surgeon are very concerned about him having the second dose of Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine as scheduled which is due in like 1.5 weeks. The plan at this time is for him to go on a liquid diet 2 days before the second dose so that there is nothing in him to create intestinal block. Outcomes of events: Bowel movements are irregular because just starting to get back into eating really for a few days. The first few days home he was on a soft diet of basically jell-o pudding and broths. He is on an ultra-low fiber diet right now so it&#39;s a different diet than he is accustomed to. Some of what he is eating goes right through, other times there is no bulk to come out; he kind of feels like he is constipated but it is just that there is nothing there. Doctor later this week will determine how much he can normalize his diet. Metamucil which a lot of diabetics do, doctor did not want him to take that until everything settles down. He feels bruised; his guts just feel bruised; he thinks from just the pressure there and getting in and out of the hospital bed was horrible. When he called doctor before he went to the hospital 30Jan2021, doctor told him this is coincidence, that this patient was the third that he has had who in 24 hours has had significant intestinal or bowel reaction; that he is not the first who has dealt with severe gastrointestinal problems following the Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. Caller clarified he has no first hand knowledge of those other patients/events/products, this was just mentioned to him by the doctor over the phone. He had no further information to provide for this report; but doctor might be able to provide further information. Relevant Tests: they did a COVID test when he was admitted to hospital 30Jan2021, gave results when he left the hospital-took them 6 days-unknown result. They did X-rays and scan of his abdomen to monitor intestinal blockage-results unknown. Blood work done but nothing remarkable there-results unknown. His blood pressure actually was low while in hospital-specific results unknown. Glucose levels were very high while in hospital which he is sure was because they had him on an IV drip that must have had glucose in it because he was not eating anything and when in pain and anxiety his sugar goes up-further details of results unknown. Patient had no further information to provide regarding testing/investigations/lab work, blood work, imaging, x-rays, etc for this report. Outcome of events were reported as unknown.

The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient just recently had surgery he had a hernia removed and a week after that; he had the operation done arthroscopically and a week after that; the lower right abdominal area was swollen and he was in a lot of pain and he ended up going to the hospital and they admitted him in the ER and they gave him some Morphine and hooked up to all kinds of stuff and eventually they found out that an artery had been nicked and they went in and fixed that and his hemoglobin has been going up and down. At any rate he had surgery again and they cleaned out all of that blood and they didn&#39;t find any more leaks but the patient&#39;s wife was wondering if it would be okay to have the booster for the COVID vaccine on 18Feb2021 (Thursday). The patient&#39;s wife confirmed that all of this happened since him having the first dose of the vaccine, but it was not related. The patient&#39;s wife also reported that the patient&#39;s height shrunk, and he was 5&#39;11.75&#34;. The outcome of artery had been nicked was recovered, and unknown for the rest of the events.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: There is no reasonable possibility that the reported events were related to BNT162b2. These are more likely associated with the surgical condition and post surgical complications.

                                                Collapse of lung; Diarrhea; very weak; lost his appetite; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.  A 78-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 intramuscular, administered on right arm on 03Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL9261) at single dose (at the age of 78 years old) for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history included had vascular problems in his legs, and his legs were very clogged. The doctors couldn&#39;t do anything and tried to do a catheterization. Thyroid was not okay, and now his doctor increased his thyroid medication. The reporter blamed the hospital for doing something wrong when her husband was there the last time. She said the hospital made a mistake and gave her husband the wrong medication. She said the first time her husband was at the hospital, the hospital didn&#39;t give her husband his thyroid medicine. She said the second time, the hospital gave her husband the wrong dose of medication. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) dose 1 on 10Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient previously took flu vaccines in Sep2020. On Mar2021, the reporter&#39;s husband was okay at first. She said now her husband had diarrhea and pooped in his clothes. She said her husband was very weak and lost his appetite. She clarified her husband&#39;s symptoms started probably 2 weeks ago, and her husband was worse, and like a different person now. She said her husband used to eat at the table, and now he just sits in his chair, and after 5:00PM he wants to go to bed. She said she was not sure if her husband&#39;s symptoms were related to the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said her husband was supposed to have heart bypass surgery on Monday (22Mar2021), and his surgeon called on Saturday night (20Mar2021) and called off her husband&#39;s surgery. She said the surgeon said her husband had a collapsed lung. She said her husband had a chest x-ray in late Feb2021 and his lungs were clear. She said everything that happened to her husband, happened after he had his second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. She said she was not sure if her husband&#39;s collapsed lung (19Mar2021) was related to his second COVID-19 Vaccine. She said before getting the COVID-19 Vaccine, her husband did not have a problem with his lungs. She said her husband&#39;s surgeon can&#39;t figure out why her husband&#39;s lung collapsed. She said she can&#39;t prove his collapsed lung was a side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine, but her husband never had sick lungs in his life. She said she knows her husband doesn&#39;t have the COVID-19 Virus because he had to be tested on Saturday (20Mar2021) for the COVID-19 Virus before he could have his surgery on Monday (22Mar2021). She said her husband&#39;s COVID-19 Virus test was negative Saturday, but he has all these problems. The patient&#39;s wife was afraid to give her husband Pepto Bismol, so she didn&#39;t give her husband anything. She said her husband has an appointment on Thursday (25Mar2021) with his primary care doctor to talk about his symptoms. The outcome of collapsed lung was unknown and other events were not recovered.

                                                After duing light work on Saturday morning. I sat down for a few minutes and felt a little light headed.  My stomach became quisy and I had to go into the bathroom, became nauseated and had to vomit. I had a quisy stomach most of the balance of the day.  I experiecnced a restless night. However, by mid-morning  Sunday I began to feel better and have had no additonal inegative effect.  The only other  unexplained  item was that on Sunday I checked my blood presure and it was 154/ 85. This is very unusual,  as due to the nifedipine I take for my DES, my average for years is around 125/80.  Today, Tuesday, I checked it again and it still  at 158/87.  I have an appointment with my cardiologist  in 2 weeks and will discuss this with him.

On third day after second vaccination,  should symptoms gone but I started to develop diffuse myalgias.  By 4th day, began having problems with my memory. I could not figure out some instructions on a computer program. I had some trouble recognizing a common object in my hand.  Then mild ataxia.  Excessive sleepiness in 2-3 hour intervals.  On 8th day, developed  abdominal pain similar to diverticulitis. And became very constipated. I had forgotten to take the Parnate and missed two doses. I had forgotten to take Metamucil and Miralax. these led to the constipation and abdominal pain.  On advice of psychopharmacologist, I resumed Parnate  and started to feel better.  I resumed laxatives and good effect. Abdominal symptoms abated in two additional days.  I had gone to ER  but seen only informally by my medical friends. After 3 hour, and getting better, I left.   Blood tests were normal.  No exam.   Since 02/27/2021, I have felt perfectly normal.   Recovered.

                                                Diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). A 79-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 16Feb2021 (lot number reported as EN9581 and EL1282; pending clarification) at the age of 79 years old, as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. There were no relevant medical history and concomitant medications. On 23Feb2021, seven days after the vaccine shot, the patient experienced diarrhea and it was just resistant (diarrhea won&#39;t stop). The patient had been in the hospital (was admitted) from Friday morning (26Feb2021) to 01Mar2021 due to the event; and yesterday morning (02Mar2021) the patient underwent endoscopy and colonoscopy with unknown results. The adverse event required a visit to the emergency room. The patient did not receive any vaccinations 4 weeks prior to the administration of first COVID vaccine. There were no additional vaccines administered on same date as Pfizer COVID vaccine. The patient has not recovered from diarrhea as of this report.    Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

Patient drove himself to the hospital for evaluation and treatment on Saturday, March 27th where he collapsed in cardiac arrest. he was resuscitated and stabilized on life support. He died of multiple organ failure on Monday March 29th. The official diagnosis was Severe Septic Shock. It is unclear if any infective agent was identified. It should be noted that sepsis is a condition in which immune dysregulation is inherent and includes cytokine storm activity. The possible correlation between vaccination and the subsequent development of sepsis should be investigated.

A 79-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, dose 2, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6204) as SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included prostate cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and major radial prostatectomy from 04Feb2021 to an unknown date. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EN9581) on 17Feb2021 for COVID-19 immunisation and experienced chills, low grade fever and fatigue. There were no concomitant medications. The patient got the second dose of BNT162B2. The patient was fine, had no problems until 15Mar20201 (4 days afterwards), the patient stated, &#34;I started getting chills, shaking uncontrollably , nausea, fatigue, a little bit of everything. I wouldn&#39;t be calling you but this has not subsided. It&#39;s been 3 weeks now and I&#39;m not feeling well. It ebbs and tides. I&#39;ve been taking a diary. I went to the ER last Monday because I was wheezing in the morning and had shortness of breathe in between all the other symptoms. They did all kind of blood tests, covid test which was negative, chest x-ray showed bronchitis. Blood work and ultrasound of my bladder with unknown results. They sent me home with a inhaler, steroid and an antibiotic and every day since then it seems like at night 9, or 10 o&#39;clock I start feeling better and sleep through the night. My fever is 97.7 degrees fahrenheit but about 2, 3 or 4 o&#39;clock my fever ticks up a little and I start to feel lousy, my stomach feels. I feel like I have hot flashes; a feeling of warmth with achiness and lack of appetite. So I take my Tylenol 7 or 8 o&#39;clock at night my temperature is 97.7F. I haven&#39;t had 1 good day since. I&#39;ve been to my doctor, ER, I&#39;ve talked with the CDC. What information do you have for people who have had long term symptoms/side effects? What am I supposed to do? Someone from Pfizer needs to give me advice. If not I&#39;ll go to  the news network. I don&#39;t feel well. It&#39;s directly related. No one has given me relief or help. It&#39;s impacting my life. I&#39;ve been sick every day.  Is there someone above you who can tell me what to do? I took their (Pfizer&#39;s) vaccine that was recommended. It was your vaccine. Not mine. Someone has to have an answer for me. Unless you want to go and have lawsuit and the news. Just think about it, if you had to go through the symptoms of having the flu everyday. Please relay this to someone. If I don&#39;t heard back within a week, then I&#39;m going ballistic. It&#39;s not going to be pretty. Someone has to get back to me to help. I want someone to tell me that I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m not the only experiencing this. There has to be an answer. I took your vaccine. You are responsible. I want to know. I can&#39;t be the only one in the whole world who is feeling like this. I&#39;ve been to the ER and the doctors. I&#39;ve had every side effects but theirs go away in a few days, but mine hasn&#39;t. I need advice, that I&#39;m not nuts, something that will help me get better. I want to feel better. It&#39;s effecting my family my life. Doesn&#39;t it seem odd? I can&#39;t be the only one? Someone has to know something. They (drug companies) like to hide the facts. I am sick because I took BNT162B2 vaccine. I need someone to get back to me.&#34; After the second dose of BNT162B2, the patient has been experiencing an achy feeling, heat throughout the body, shivering, shaking, trouble walking, and some fever. He reports taking Tylenol, and that helps, but he is still having symptoms that come and go and it has been 3 weeks since the second injection of the Pfizer covid-19 vaccine. He reports going to the ER for treatment after the second injection, and a COVID-19 test was negative and they did not find anything else other than the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine that would be causing his symptoms. The events hasn&#39;t gone away, it&#39;s now about 3.5 weeks and he hasn&#39;t had a good day since then he has been experiencing chills and fever. It goes away for a couple hours, it goes away till around 9 or 10PM at night, then he is good at night, then in the afternoons around 2PM or so the fever kind of comes back and instead of chills he is getting warm flush, when taking his temperature he notices it ticks up. He is taking Tylenol every 6 hours. He would like to know if this is normal and have others reports this? The First time he experienced the chills and fatigue it was on 18Feb2021. Then the second time the chills, fever, fatigue, and nausea started on 15Mar2021. The events were described, &#34;Fever: It is not as steady, when it ticks up, it is never going past 100F, it&#39;s been like 98 and 99, that&#39;s when he starts to feeling so  bad. He provides todays temperatures, this morning 97.5F he usually runs low, then about 10AM 97.7, then at 11AM 98F, then an hour ago it was 98.8F and he can  feel the difference. Nausea: It occurs when the temperature ticks up, it&#39;s not really nausea but its uneasiness in the stomach, not necessarily nausea but he feels no appetite. It has the Same pattern as the fever. Fatigue: Yesterday morning he got a blood test and he did not have a fever he was normal 97F, but he could barely take 10 steps, the fatigue varies, it does not coincide with the fever. Looking back over the 3 weeks, the fatigue is better now. On 21Mar2021 he went to the ER because he was feeling so bad, there was a little bit of wheezing and shortness of breath, they did lab work and a chest X-ray, they sent him home with an antibiotic and a steroid inhaler. The chest X-ray showed Bronchitis. Blood work results are Unknown. He clarifies that the ER sent him home the same day after 9 hours, he was not admitted to the hospital.

                                                Two weeks after the first Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the patient experienced vertigo-like symptoms with severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. He was admitted to the hospital where he stayed for a few days. After treating for vertigo, symptoms subsided. These symptoms have recurred several times since then. He was hospitalized again last week for several days. He also made another trip to the ER. Other times he was treated at home with prescribed medicine. He had symptoms of encephalitis. After multiple tests proved inconclusive, we now suspect this was an adverse event brought about by the first Covid-9 vaccine.

An 80-year old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, Lot Number and Expiration Date unknown) via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 07:00AM (vaccine location: Arm, Left Upper) at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history included ongoing parkinson&#39;s disease (probably had Parkinson&#39;s disease for 8 years, but was formally diagnosed 6 years ago) and peripheral neuropathy. The concomitant medications was reported as sinemet for parkinson&#39;s disease and gabapentin for peripheral neuropathy, about 6 years. Patient said 36 hours after having his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, he had massive diarrhea on 14Jan2021 at 04:00PM. He said the diarrhea only happened one time. He said he went on a BRAT diet for a few days and then back to a regular diet. He clarified the diarrhea was brown. He said he had 1 incident of blood in his stool after that on 15Jan2021. He said he couldn&#39;t get an appointment with his doctor, so he went to emergency room. He said he was at the emergency room from 8:00AM-4:00 PM. He said the emergency room doctor told him he probably didn&#39;t have any recurrence of blood in his stool, because the blood was caused by his episode of diarrhea the day before. He said the emergency room doctor postulated that his diarrhea was caused by the COVID-19 Vaccine because there was a 36-hour delay between receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine and having diarrhea. The outcome of diarrhea was recovered on 14Jan2021. The outcome of blood in stool was recovered on 15Jan2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

                                                In the mid-afternoon of the day of the vaccination (Feb. 24, 2021) I developed something that felt to me like heartburn which I do not normally have.  Its location was mid-chest (near the heart).  It was moderate at first but became more intense with time.  By around 6 PM, Feb. 24, the pain was still building, but had migrated lower in my torso closer to my stomach.  The pain reached a peak around 3 AM,  Feb. 25, 2021.  and from that time kept diminishing until it was essentially gone by about 6 PM on Feb. 25, 2021.  Even at its worst, the pain was not so intense that I felt I needed medical treatment.  I always felt during this episode that the pain was completely manageable.

An 80-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EM6207), second dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Mar2021 15:00 (Batch/), single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing Diagnosed with COPD 3-4 years ago and is not taking any medication for it, (blood pressure) hypertension from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing had been taking Atenolol for blood pressure. Concomitant medication included atenolol. The patient had the first dose of bnt162b2 vaccine (Lot EN6023) on 27Feb2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced hypertension aggravated. He went back to doctor and had been taking Atenolol for blood pressure. It has always been dose 50/25. His blood pressure was up just a bit and he cannot verify who this girl was that changed it to 100/25. He did not like the way he felt and eliminated it and went back to the previous dose. He had two over a period of 2-3 days. It is in a pharmacy vial.  He does not have a lot or expiration for the Atenolol 100/25.  The date his blood pressure was up was for the past couple of times.Usually, it is 120/60-70 and  then it jumped up to 150/60-70 and that is why it needed to be changed.  It was filled on 18Mar2021, which was after first vaccine but before second dose. Patient got deathly sick over the weekend on 02Apr2021. He had the shot on 20 Mar 2021, and it has been more than the two days you could have a reaction. He was deathly sick. On 02Apr2021, he had just about all of the symptoms; sweaty, chills, face red, and hands red, indigestion, constipation and could not go to the bathroom. He was about as sick as he had ever been.  He know it is not supposed to be that long. He could not sleep for two days. His face and palms got really red. He did not have a fever. He walked the floor and only slept 2 hours in two days. On 31Mar2021, he goes to a pain center and got shots in his neck. He asked the doctor if his shot had anything different than he had been getting and he confirmed that it was no different. He never had a reaction before the one he got on 31Mar2021, and thought it may have been the virus shot. He said one other thing happened and is not sure if it had anything to do with it or not. He just started to feel worse and worse. Today is the first day he felt better. He is 80 and has not been this sick. It got really bad but today it is much better. He did not sleep for two days and last night he slept and feels better. For the indigestion, it got worse before it got better. For constipation, he got relief last night and that is why he feels better today. NO ER or physician&#39;s office required- He had a previously scheduled office visit for pain center. The outcome of the events was recovering. The event insomnia was assessed by the reporter as medically significant.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

When to call 911 or Proceed to the closest Emergency Department: If you are experiencing life threatening COVID-19 symptoms including but not limited to: high fever, trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, blueish lips or face.How to Improve Your Breathing with COVID-19               Try to spend as little time as possible flat on your back! The largest part of your lungs are in the back of your body. When you lay on your back this causes fluid to pool in those parts of your lungs making it harder to breathe. Laying in different positions or sitting up will allow all the different parts of your lung to expand properly. You may notice it is easier to breathe immediately or soon after changing positions.                One of the best positions for this is called &#39;prone position&#39; which is laying face down on your belly. This position makes it easiest for the biggest parts of your lungs to expand easily. This is called &#39;proning&#39; and the more time spent proning the happier your lungs will be. Laying on your sides or sitting up in a chair is also helpful for breathing and changing positions helps keep your skin healthy.   Tips to Help with Repositioning ? Try placing pillows under the chest, hips, and lower legs when lying face down ? Trying different arm and leg positions can assist with comfort  ? Eat your meals sitting up in a chair when possible ? When laying on your side, a pillow behind you will help you not to roll on your back if you fall asleep ? If a position is too uncomfortable move on to another; comfort and rest are important parts of recovery ? Switch positions in a rotation to help all the areas of your lungs expand        After Visit Summary (Printed 3/30/2021) Additional Documentation  Vitals: BP 158/83Important   (BP Location: Right arm, Patient Position: Sitting) Pulse 58Important   Temp 36.9 °C (98.5 °F) SpO2 95%  More Vitals

Treatment team COVID-19 Principal problem Chronic anticoagulation  Persistent atrial fibrillation (CMS/HCC)  COVID-19  Confusion  Hypoxemia Hospital Course: In his hospital stay we managed his medical issues as follows;   Confusion/Syncope in the setting of COVID-19 infection Chronic atrial fibrillation/sinus node dysfunction Hypertension Prediabetes Patient received first dose of vaccination on 3/16 and afterwards started having muscle aches and body pains, later on found out to be having Covid 19&#43; test, he might be having Covid infection before vaccination as well and symptoms showed with vaccination.  On 3/24 he was found out to be having confusion, family called EMS.  They tried to debride patient on his feet and he collapsed for about 10 seconds.  He did mention that he usually get dizziness/lightheadedness upon standing from bed.  Although patient has a history of A. fib but remained rate controlled during hospital stay, we held his antihypertensives including HCTZ and ARBwhile continued his Eliquis.  I believe his syncope was likely due to dehydration with decreased oral intake in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 symptoms. Before discharge is blood pressure was rising so his ARB were restarted while decision regarding HCTZ will be made by primary care physician. In regard to his COVID-19 infection, initially was started on 2 L of supplemental oxygen but his oxygen demand decreased rapidly and most of the time he remained room air, he was not showing any dyspnea, cough, fever or any other generalized symptoms of Covid 19 infection.  He did get plasma and remdesivir while inpatient, decision was made to discharge him on 3/26 as patient was symptom-free.  He also had received first dose of vaccination. I believe that he would need further remdesivir.  We will continue him on steroids for now after completion of dexamethasone for next 8 days he can recent resume his home medication of prednisone.

A 80-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EL9262), via an unspecified route of administration on 28Jan2021 at 15:00 as unknown, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. Patient said he was calling about the Pfizer shot that he got yesterday (28Jan2021) at about 3pm. He stated he experienced some of the stuff they have on the list. He got the shot around 3PM and around 7PM that evening he started having chills, his hands were shaking really bad so he covered himself up really good and once he got some warmth to his body and about an hour later the chills calmed down and he started getting a fever his temp, the highest it got was 101.3 and it did come down after all night. He had a cold rag on his head the whole night. He had some joint pain, headache and tiredness, the headache was not severe. He had some diarrhea he does not know if that is associated with that or not. He did have some food, he ate that so he doesn&#39;t know if that is the cause of the diarrhea but it would not have caused all the other symptoms. He didn&#39;t have any redness where they gave the shot at all everything was fine on that end but he figured he better call to report it since he seen these are on the list. It was reported that slight headache was pretty mild now and it was not severe, he could just feel it in there but it is pretty much gone right now. Diarrhea went through the night and in the morning. He went 3 different times but now he thinks he is cleared out and needs to get some food back in him. His card says Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. He does not see an NDC number or expiration date. He saw healthcare clinic site. Patent received vaccine because wants to be protected like all the other seniors. He went through night and that was pretty bad but he was starting to feel better now. He was tired it drained him he still feels pretty out of it but he is starting to feel better. He asked is there any concern about any of this stuff. He said everything was starting to quiet down now he doesn&#39;t think that would be necessary unless he had a relapse and he does not think that would happen at this point. The outcome of the event chills was recovered, slight headache was recovering and outcome of the other events was unknown.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                crying; feeling nausea; depression; feeling dizziness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s wife). An 80-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 17May2021 09:00 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8729) as 1st dose, single for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included heart valve replacement from 12Mar2021, kidney infection, had a heart bypass and is diabetic. The patient has no concomitant medications. The patient got the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 17May2021, and the next day (18May2021) he woke up with dizziness. The reporter asked how long the symptoms last after the Covid vaccine. He is sort of getting nausea when he tries to get up. He was also real depressed. It kind of started the next day after the vaccine (18May2021), but Wednesday she was concerned because the patient was crying a lot which is unusual for him. The nausea started today (25May2021). He hasn&#39;t been up and about. The dizziness is about the same. They called his primary caregiver who started him on some antidepressants. She picked up the information sheet that was given to them with the Covid vaccine and read there that dizziness was a side effect and a feeling of impending doom which is sort of how he was feeling. Now that&#39;s why she was wondering when the symptoms would be over. She doesn&#39;t really think he needs anything. He has never been depressed. She thinks now it is a side effect from the vaccine. She thinks the depression has improved. He is not crying anymore, but somebody is with him all the time. This was his first dose of the vaccine. He is supposed to go back on 07Jun2021 for his second. The outcome the event depression was recovering, event crying was recovered on an unspecified date and the other events was not recovered.

An 81-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on 15Jan2021 18:00 on Arm left at single dose (Lot # EL3249) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant medications were none. He did fine right after, his arm wasn&#39;t sore, he felt fine. The next day he had nothing, no soreness, nothing, he felt great the next day. Dizziness started in the morning 17Jan2021 when he got up he said good morning and then said he would bring her back a cup coffee then he became very dizzy and leaned against the wall for support and then he fell, he was okay but he fell. He did go the emergency room because he fell and hit was head and it was bleeding. They told him it was not related to the vaccine but it is one of the things that are on the form that could happen. She says it was okay if it caused it she is just looking for a reason.  Now today (18Jan2021) he feels fine she wants to know what causes that side effect. She says she is supposed to be getting her vaccine too. He had one bad dizzy spell and then it went away, and she thinks he got kind of nauseous with it. It says this can happen, it said it could happen right after but in his case it did not, it happened within probably 34 hours or something. Outcome of the event dizziness has recovered completely at this point. Outcome of other events was unknown.

                                                Developed watery diarrhea; malaise; weight loss; collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient). An 81-years-old male patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), via an unspecified route of administration on Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included was none. No covid prior vaccination. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included allopurinol (ALLOPURINOL), losartan potassium (COZAAR), tadalafil (TADALAFIL), acetylsalicylic acid (ASPRIN), simvastatin (ZOCOR). Historical vaccine included BNT162B2 details: (Product= COVID 19) for covid-19 immunisation, Lot number= EL1284, Administration date= 31Dec2020, administration time= 11:00 AM, vaccine location: Left arm, dose number= 1, Developed watery diarrhea about 5 days after the dose. No other vaccine in four weeks. Adverse event: watery diarrhea improved somewhat but worsened again after the second dose of vaccine, along with some malaise and weight loss, since 05Jan2021. Extensive investigations eventually revealed collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies in Jan2021. May well be coincidence, but interested to know if others have been reported. AE resulted in: Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. AE treatment: Anti-diarrheals, budesonide. The event outcome of collagenous colitis was recovering, watery diarrhea was  not recovered, outcome of other event was unknown. Covid test post vaccination covid test date=19Jan2021, which was negative.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, the company considers that a causal relationship between collagenous colitis on colonoscopy biopsies and bnt162b2 cannot be excluded due to plausible temporal association.

This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. A 81-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Solution for injection), Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 02Feb2021 (at the age of 81-year-old) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization.Medical history included Transverse Myelitis which is a virus of the spinal cord (from age of 11 yr), wheelchair user, difficulty walking (from the transverse myelitis). Reporter and her husband both received the first Pfizer Covid vaccine on 02Feb2021.The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On11Feb2021, patient experienced dry heaves, pain and bloating in his stomach, his extremities felt cold and he was shivering, had night sweats and wasn&#39;t eating or drinking. He has been feeling progressively worse since Feb 11th, but she stated she has been taking his temperature and he did not had a fever but had been very thirsty. He had not been able to walk the last couple of days and had to use his wheelchair. Last night on 10Feb2021, he probably drank gallons of water due to his excessive thirst. His doctor told him to take acetaminophen and ibuprofen, which he did, but it didn&#39;t help. His symptoms have progressed such that the reporter dropped her husband off at the ER today. Reporter stated that he now did have a fever and is awaiting results of a chest x-ray and lab work (performed on 16Feb2021). He was having difficulty breathing, but his oxygen levels were normal. Reporter read online about two people in (city) developed transverse myelitis after receiving a Covid vaccine, but she was not sure which vaccine they received. She was calling to report this information to Pfizer and to see if these types of reactions have been reported and at 10 days post initial vaccination. The patient Is currently in the emergency Room and has not been able to eat for 5 days. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 82-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Batch/lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Jan2021 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Parkinson&#39;s disease from an unknown date. The doctor told him to make an appointment with his Parkinson&#39;s doctor and tell him, maybe that has something do with it. There were no concomitant medications. The patient experienced burning when he urinates for 2 weeks, a sharp pain where his navel is, and pain in his stomach on Jan2021. He was wondering if it could be from the shot or if it is something else. He had an appointment with his doctor on Monday and he told him about it. The doctor gave him an antibiotic, Ciprofloxacin 500 mg that made him dizzy, he does not know if he will continue to take it but it helped the burning, the burning was not as bad.

A contactable consumer (patient) reported that an 82-year-old male patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number was reported as &#34;EUO150&#34;/&#34;LU0150&#34;), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on 13Apr2021 11:15 (at the age of 82-years-old) as a single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The vaccine was administered at the hospital. The patient medical history included blood pressure, allergy, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD), liver genetic deficiency, and had allergy mice, cat, dust and trees. The patient previously took sulphur and aspirin and makes him bleed because his blood was already thin. Concomitant medications included amlodipine taken for blood pressure; cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC [CETIRIZINE HYDROCHLORIDE]) taken for allergy; cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B12 [CYANOCOBALAMIN]) taken for an unspecified indication; all were start and stop date were not reported. An 82-year-old caller received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine yesterday (13Apr2021), around 11:15 am. He added he was monitored for 15 minutes post injection and then used the public transportation to run some errands and return home. He said he received the injection on his left arm had soreness in this arm after vaccination. He explained around 3-3:30 pm he was walking to get the bus and then felt very tired to the point he wanted to sit on the pavement. He also described it as feeling exhausted. He explained he was so tired on the bus that he was falling asleep and almost missed his stop. He said he also began having joint and muscle pain on the bus. He specified he got home around 4 pm and he then experienced tiredness, headaches, muscle and joint pains, hot flashes, chills, and felt nauseous but didn&#39;t vomit. He specified he felt so hot, he had to turn off the heat and remove his clothes, but then he had chills/cold chills and had to turn the heat back on and thought he had a fever. He said around 11 o&#39;clock he had appetite. He added he had cramping all through the night to the point he wanted to cry. He couldn&#39;t sleep. He specified the pain was in his hands, legs, feet, and joints. He also said he felt tired like he had worked for 12,000 hours and was not able to move. He said he had weakness to the point he couldn&#39;t get up to go to the bathroom. He said he had the headaches all through the night. He was feeling unwell, dizzy. He explained he felt like he was going to die; he was worried about his body. He said he still feels tired. They told him he would only have a sore arm, which he did, but everything else was sore too until about 08:00 today (14Apr2021). He explained that he didn&#39;t have all these issues before vaccination. He explained how disappointed he was with his reaction to the vaccine given that he was reluctant to the unapproved vaccine at beginning because he wasn&#39;t the person that take a lot of injection and medications, and so finally after his primary physician to influence him to get the vaccine. He mentioned he lives alone, healthy, vegetarian, never smoked, never took recreational drugs, does acupuncture, and takes little medications. He explained most people and his acupuncture doctor said he shouldn&#39;t get much reaction from the first dose and the reactions to the second dose are more prevalent. He added he was told that people have mainly experienced soreness in their arm after this vaccination with the first dose. He asked if his symptoms were reported after getting the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Everyone told him the first vaccine is a whiz. That it was easy. The second vaccine is the one that have side effects on. He also stated that he almost called to get an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Said that if he had these reactions with the first one, he does not want to take the second vaccine. Sometimes he regret that he have taken it now because he did not expect all of this to happen to him and they just told him that he will have a sore arm on left arm. He was in kind of shock to experience all of this and he was G6PD (Intent: History). He cannot take Sulfur and Aspirin because that makes him bleed because his blood was already thin but that would be no problem also have a liver genetic deficiency (Intent: History). He was allergic to mice, cat, dust and trees (Intent: History). So, he told all what he had that they knew in the beginning they said none of those things will affect. He take B12 (Intent: History) too once a month, he get injection for allergies for his cats and trees and grass once a month but they told him none of the things will affect him. The outcome of the events was unknown.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

On Wednesday, January 20, 2021, at 9:22 AM, I received my first dose vaccination of Pfizer COVID-19 Lot# EL3247 at the Health Clinic Site.  At approximately 4 PM that afternoon I experienced the first of a number of episodes of watery, gassy, non - bloody diarrhea which was heralded by great urgency but was accompanied by neither  fever, abdominal pain , nor any other systemic signs or symptoms.  There was no anosmia, headache, nor respiratory difficulty.  I continued to feel clinically well and I had no change of my daily activities.  I experienced no change of appetite.  I experienced two or three such urgent episodes daily for the next eight days. At no time during that week did I have a formed stool.  I cannot recall the last prior episode of watery . gassy diarrhea since it is not an experience which I have experience for, likely, decades.  During the 7-8 day period, my wife and I ate exactly the same foods. My wife experienced no diarrhea, cramping of frequent stooling. She reports that all of her stools have been normal. After three or four days, I spoke with several internists who suggested that I obtain a   SARS-CO-V-2 NAT, NP Swab test. Since I had been symptomatic for a number of days. I self quarantined and moved out of my wife?s and my bedroom. During all that time I wore a face mask and increased the frequency and duration of hand washing. NO SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by PCR.  It is now 48 hours since my last watery, gassy stool. I have just passed a normal appearing, non -melanotic, formed stool.  Sincerely,  Patient

                                                Received first dose on afternoon of 1/22/2021.  No apparent side effects initially.  Then in early morning hours of 1/25/2021 he woke up throwing up, then dry heaving.  Found some Tums (only thing we had) and gave that to him.  He went back to bed and went back to sleep - nothing further for 3 days. Then on 1/28/2021 he again began feeling nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. Again, it lasted a short time and was over.  Since then there have been 2 other episodes of random nausea, but this time without vomiting.  This is from a man who does not throw up EVER.  Then, sometime after the first shot, which was received 2 days after we returned from a trip to see family, he began having explosive diarrhea. Up until this time he had been suffering (for months or years) with chronic constipation - which we had been working with the doctor with to alleviate.  I do not know the exact date this started, as it   is not the kind of info Dad was keen to share, but I do know that it was NOT happening before the vaccine, as we were traveling and I would have had to make emergency stops for him (this has been so bad he has at times had to change clothes because he could not get to the restroom from his living room).  As I became aware of it I began gradually taking him OFF  stool softeners and osmotics we had him on, to the point that he now takes NOTHING and  yet he still has explosive diarrhea DAILY and multiple times.

The patient went to his eye doctor for an eye exam, and he was not real comfortable because he was semi-nauseous. The patient had experienced fatigue, tiredness, and nausea since receiving his first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. The patient reported he also had chills. The patient had an increase in a congested cough recently. The patient continues to feel fatigued, tired, and nauseated. The patient felt like he should have gone to the Emergency Room, or seen his doctor when he experienced the side effects after the vaccine, but he didn&#39;t go. The patient has been taking cough medicine. The patient has COPD  and takes the cough medicine at night before he goes to bed. The patient clarified that he started taking the cough medicine because he had an increase in a congested cough recently. The patient clarified he has a sticky, yellowish phlegm that he coughs up. The patient said recently the phlegm changed to a reddish-brown color. The patient said his phlegm will go back and forth from the yellowish color to a dark brown color. The patient said he started the cough medicine about a week or so ago. The patient said it was a 4 ounce bottle of cough medicine. The patient said he takes a 20ml dose at night, so he doesn&#39;t start hacking while he sleeps. The patient just finished the 4 ounce bottle of cough medicine last night. The patient takes over-the-counter Tussin DM Max cough medicine. The patient is scheduled for his second COVID-19 Vaccine on 15Feb2021.

Became bloated with severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath and difficulty walking due to pain. Tried OTC stool softeners, miralax, prune juice and no relief. Seen in ER on 03/20/21 for abdominal pain, bloating and constipation. CT scans did not provide answers. Seen by GI specialist and had colonoscopy and EGD on 03/29/21 which did not provide answers on sudden stop of bowel movement. Almost a month later still not having bowel movements regularly despite taking Linzess as prescribed, still have abdominal pain and bloating daily, difficulty eating due to bloating and pain, have lost 7 pounds in the past 3 weeks and now remaining in bed more throughout the day due to pain/bloating. Becoming depressed and irritable which was NEVER a problem prior to the 2nd Pfizer covid-19 vaccine.

An 84-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 12Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (he has had it for years. He says he uses a machine when he goes to bed, a mask). The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took flu shot (unspecified) one injection a few (also reported as 3) weeks ago. The patient received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 12Jan2021 in the evening about 05:30-06:00PM. The following morning on 13Jan2021, he experienced headache and loose stools. The loose stools were described as &#34;squirting&#34; of over the next 5 days and then the loose stools started to improve. He says starting Wednesday he had really loose stool and was squirting liquid and it has bad for about 3 days. He says Saturday he started having loose, real loose stools, not squirting, but this has gone through to today. He says he still has a feeling kind of like he needs to go to the bathroom all the time. He says he never had a loose stool as far back as he can remember before, he didn&#39;t take anything for it, his doctor isn&#39;t giving the vaccine so he didn&#39;t contact him. He says he also didn&#39;t want to mess up by taking anything. He was squirting and had loose stool Wednesday morning and then that continued until today, he was not squirting, was having very loose stool, that was better, since he was not squirting. He still has some loose stools but was no longer &#34;squirting&#34; and still had a feeling in the bottom of his stomach like he needs to go to the bathroom. The headache gradually improved after the initial injection and he only has a little headache left currently. Patient had a headache the first couple of days, it was real light until now, he was still kind of not back to normal. He wanted to know if this will go away, since he is due for next virus shot in a week or so and was kind of dubious about taking it. On unspecified date in Jan2021, the patient had arm soreness that went away and was gone, he was sore for a couple days. The outcome of the events diarrhea and headache was recovering; event &#34;He still has some loose stools but was no longer &#34;squirting&#34; and still had a feeling in the bottom of his stomach like he needs to go to the bathroom&#34; was not recovered; and arm soreness was recovered in Jan2021.

An 84-year-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: E18982, expiration date was not reported), intramuscular on the left arm (also reported as left shoulder) on 15Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  The patient medical history was not reported. It was reported that the patient was taking an unspecified blood thinner and other unspecified products. It was reported that patient got the first dose on 15Jan2021 and everything was fine. The following Friday, exactly a week later, on 22Jan2021 at 930am he got violently sick as far as throwing up and dysentery. He was asking if it could be from the shot. He got sick and was heaving for 7 hours, then he was dry heaving after throwing up so much, it was green bile. He knew he was getting dehydrated and drank a bottle of Pedialyte at 7pm that night. He had to stay a half hour after getting the vaccine since they wanted to monitor him a little longer since he takes blood thinners an other crap. He did not specify the other medications that he takes. On Saturday he felt fine but he felt weak. The patient recovered from dysentery and throwing up on 23Jan2021, while outcome of the remaining events was unknown.

An 84-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL9264) via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 08Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization and apixaban (ELIQUIS) via an unspecified route of administration from an unspecified date and ongoing at an unspecified dose and frequency for an unspecified indication. Medical history included afib and heart rate (abnormal). Concomitant medication included propranolol hydrochloride (MANOPROLOL) for afib. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 on 18Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization (lot: EL1283 on the left arm) and experienced a little bit of soreness at the injection site. The patient took his temperature and it was at 99.3 F. Patient asked, &#34;Is that within range? Can I take Tylenol?&#34; The patient stated that when he first got his shot of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine at the (Hospital name) in (City name) he didn&#39;t have any problems or didn&#39;t experience any side effects. Then after receiving his 2nd shot on 08Feb2021, he mentioned that he started having trouble. On 10Feb2021, he started to experience some side effects and stated, &#34;I was as weak as I could be, I didn&#39;t have appetite and I had a little fever. I just feel super weak but not like if you have corona. Now, I can sleep under oxygen and it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore and when I get up I don&#39;t need oxygen anymore and I can breathe freely.&#34; Wanted to know how long will his symptoms last. He was as weak as a rag, has a little fever that comes and goes, does not go over 101, stated he was taking Eliquis does not know if that was important or not, slept with oxygen but has not had any trouble breathing. Wondering if this was standard. The action taken for apixaban was unknown. Outcome of the event &#39;didn&#39;t have appetite&#39; was unknown and not recovered for the other events.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter confirms that her husband received no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine. On 04Feb2021, the patient received the first dose of the vaccine and experienced diarrhea and vomiting on. The reporter wants to know if the patient could get this after the second dose, too. The reporter also enquired if someone does not have side effects from the first dose, could they get them from the second dose and wants to know what would happen if she delayed her second dose. Two weeks after receiving the first dose patient had a very bad reaction. The reporter wants to know if her husband would experience the same if he received the second dose. The reporter states that her husband no longer has the vomiting and diarrhea, but he was still weak from it. The patient took Imodium AD, because he could not leave the house to see his doctor, because the diarrhea was so severe. The outcome of event diarrhea and vomiting was resolved on 14Feb2021, for weakness was not resolved and for illness was unknown.

An 85-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included epilepsy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Caller says her father in law hasn&#39;t had seizure in years, it was diagnosed when he was a kid, 60-70 years ago).  There were no concomitant medications.  The reporter is calling on behalf of her father in law. She said he had his first dose of the COVID vaccine recently, she pulled this number off of the paperwork today. She says that she believes he had a side effect for it, and also he was rescheduled for his second dose. She says his second dose was supposed to be in 21 days but they rescheduled him for it at 18 days instead. She says he got the first dose on 11Jan, and they rescheduled his next for the 29th. She says she wanted to know if this was correct or ok. The reporter says that the following day he ended up having massive diarrhea, that it caused him while he was on the commode to pass out and he fell and hit his face, the best she can tell he was alone at the time. She says he did not go to the hospital for that, he got up and cleaned himself off and took a nap, and the nurse next door checked on him later on. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Heart stopped; Could not swallow; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient&#39;s wife). An 85-year-old male patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included blood pressure abnormal (verbatim: blood pressure) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, neuropathy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, weight issue from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, diabetes from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, walker user from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medications included insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) taken for diabetes from an unspecified date to an unspecified date; and he was taking a long acting one as well. The patient previously received the influenza vaccine (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) for immunization on unknown dates (&#34;had flu shots before with no reactions and everything, nothing before&#34;). On 24Jan2021, the patient&#39;s heart stopped (death, medically significant), and could not swallow (medically significant).  The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient was taking insulin aspart (NOVOLOG) and he was taking a long acting one as well. The reporter, the patient&#39;s wife and a retired registered nurse (RN) stated, her husband (patient) just died and she thought he died from the COVID vaccine (later clarified the reason of death was-heart stopped). The patient had the vaccine on 21Jan2021, which was on a Thursday, and he was fine. On the following Sunday around 1:30 (on 24Jan2021), the patient was feeling a little weak, however, the patient&#39;s wife thought maybe his blood sugar was low. The patient&#39;s wife checked, and the patient&#39;s blood sugar was 91. The patient&#39;s wife went to get some yogurt to feed him in order to get his blood sugar up a little; &#34;which was a normal thing for him, it was not that low for him.&#34; Then, suddenly, the patient fell, and the patient&#39;s wife could not get a pulse or anything. The patient&#39;s wife called an unspecified number and she started compressions; however, he was dead. The patient&#39;s wife stated the patient just had his heart test, a three hour long one, and it was &#34;perfect three weeks ago.&#34; The patient had just gone to the doctor the other day and his blood pressure was &#34;fine and everything.&#34; The patient&#39;s wife stated that other than his diabetes, &#34;which he had for (sentence incomplete).&#34; Regarding lab tests, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;No, he had it before but not in the last two weeks. He was going for one because we just went to the doctor last week and he was going to call yesterday to make the appointment request to get his blood work done. Blood work has been good except his A1C was always high, but other than that everything was good&#34; (as reported). Regarding causality, the patient&#39;s wife stated, &#34;I do, because he was fine until about half an hour before he died. He said to me, I feel a little weak today and then I was talking to him that your upper body strength is really good and then I said, we just have to work on your weight a little more because he did have neuropathy. And then, I went out of the room and all of a sudden I just heard him fall and that is when I just went in to check his blood sugar and it was 91 and I got him yogurt and he started eating that and then that was it, he started spitting it out and he said, I could not swallow and that was it, he just died.&#34;  The patient&#39;s wife further added, &#34;I just wanted other people to know that things like this happen and I am sure it was from that because he was healthy as could be. He was walking with his walker, the day before outside and he felt fine.&#34; The clinical outcome of the event, heart stopped, was fatal. The clinical outcome of the event, could not swallow, was unknown. The patient died on 24Jan2021 due to &#34;heart stopped.&#34;  An autopsy was not performed.  The batch/lot numbers for the vaccine, PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, were not provided and will be requested during follow up.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: Heart stopped

He was cold, but only wanted something cold to drink.  He was not able to get through his normal morning routine.  By 8 am we was beginning to get confused and weaker.  By 9 am he vomited and was not able to stand up or walk.  The confusion was increasing.  We called 911.  When they arrived he had chills and was agitated.  He did not have a fever at that time.  He was transported to the emergency room.  We were not able to accompany him there, but were told he was confused, agitated and combatant.  His fever was up to 101 degrees.   The started him on antibiotics and began tests.  He tested negative for COVID and the flu.  By that evening they diagnosed him with viral meningitis and admitted him to the hospital.  The next day we were told that they had ruled out viral meningitis as well as other infections.  The infectious disease doctor said that all tests had come back negative, but they were continuing  to give him antibiotics.  A neurologist and cardiologist were called in and they were not able to find anything either.  He did complain of chest pains, but it was determined that it might be heart burn.  They did see a sign of Afib, but test were not conclusive. On Friday, Feb. 12th he was sent home with antibiotics and heart medicines.  The confusion has improved, but he is very weak and not mobile without assistance.

Again admitted and had further rheumatological and infectious work up with negative results  He was initially admitted to Hospital on 02/12 with fatigue, atypical chest pain, melena. He had received 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine on 02/10. He was hospitalized from 02/12-02/15 and  thought to have viral pericarditis.  Diagnosis at discharge: SIRS DUE TO NONINFECTIOUS PROCESS W ACUTE ORGAN DYSFUNCTION.   He was started on celebrex in addition to the the colchicine as an anti-inflammatory.  After initiation of the anti inflammatory medications, patient&#39;s fever resolved, he started feeling better and his inflammatory markers decreased.  He was monitored for another days and was feeling better.  He is therefore being discharged home.  In view of the negative work up, there is suspicion that these may be a hyper inflammatory response to the COVID vaccine since his symptoms were temporally related.

                                                My father received his first Pfizer vaccine on 02/03/21. On 2/12/21 I rushed him to the ER. He was vomiting uncontrollably and had shortness of breath. Once arrived at ER, they immediately put him on oxygen. Vomiting lasted several hours. They tested him for Covid and did a chest x-ray. Tested positive for Covid. Chest x-ray showed Covid pneumonia. Was admitted. Stayed in hospital for 5 days and was then released to nursing home for physical and occupational therapy. He was very weak and on days experienced what they called Covid fog. After 2 weeks of therapy, he was released on 03/06/21 to go back home to his apartment, with extended visiting nurse therapy. On 3/10/21, was the first visiting nurse appointment. At 12:00 an RN came to his apartment from  Home Health Care. She checked his vitals. She said his blood pressure was good, lungs sounded good and oxygen level was 98. She said he was doing good and that she would not need to continue to come out and check on him weekly. She left. At 2:30 the same day, a Physical Therapist from Home Health Care came. She asked him lots of questions and adjusted my fathers&#39; walker for him. He showed her how he was doing using the walker. Walked approximately 15-20 feet in his apartment. She checked his vitals before she left. His oxygen level was now at 91. She had him take a few deep breathes until his oxygen level was up to 93. She left and said she would be back on Friday the 12th to begin the actual physical therapy then. Within 10 minutes after she left my father started shaking uncontrollably and was having difficulties breathing. I called 911. Paramedics arrived. My fathers&#39; oxygen level was all the way down to 74. They took him to the ER. When getting him out of ambulance he began vomiting. Vomiting lasted for hours just like when he went to the hospital back in February. They tried 3 different drugs to control the nausea. They did EKG, chest and abdomen scans. Was found that he had multiple blood clots and inflammation in his lungs and a bacterial infection in his blood. After testing, bacteria was found to be E Coli. Treated him with heparin for clots and antibiotics for infection and had him on oxygen in nose. Every day thereafter, he felt worse. They switched him to a high flow oxygen mask to keep his oxygen levels up. By Saturday night (early morning Sunday) on 03/14, they had taken the high flow oxygen mask off and hooked him up to a BiPap oxygen machine because his oxygen levels were dropping too low. We were then told by the lung doctor, that the damage to his lungs was extreme and that the next step would be to put him on a ventilator and feeding tube. My father did not want this per his will and his discussion with Dr earlier in the week. Dr indicated that he would not get better just being on the BiPap machine and we then chose to have them take him off of the machine because he did not want to go on life support. My father passed away on Sunday, March 14th around 6:30pm.

The patient&#39;s son denied any previous serious reactions to medications including the components to the vaccine. Only medical condition the patient&#39;s son mentioned was hypertension. The patient was vaccinated, and appeared fine. Once he got to the waiting area, he stated, &#34;I feel hot.&#34; His coat was removed, the manager was notified,. We gave the patient something to drink, a snack, and a cold icepack. Once the patient&#39;s condition continued to decline, vital signs were assessed. Blood pressure was 140/110, pulse oximetry was 87% on room air, and patient was placed on oxygen. I notified the manager to go grab the doctor as I was helping the patient. The doctor brought a glucometer to make sure the patient was not hypoglycemic, and the result was 117 mg/dL. At this point the patient was diaphoretic, and complaining of pain in his abdomen. He also complained of nausea. The squad was alerted, and came to get the patient. At this point the patient&#39;s pulse ox was 53% on 6L of oxygen. Patient&#39;s family was present with the patient, and the patient was then transported to the hospital via EMS.

He first reported nausea occurring around 4 am on 2/25/21 and was uncomfortable all day.  He felt worse that evening and was showing a fever.  He was given Tylenol around 10 pm on 2/25/21.  He fell asleep around 2:00 am on 2/26/21 and woke up around 3:00 or 3:15.  He had a drink of water then collapsed.  I performed chest compressions until the EMTs arrived but he was likely dead by the time they arrived.

Hand x-ray did not show signs of fracture, head CT did not show any signs of new strokes, and labs showed mild BNP elevation. Per ED note, &#34;Based on the patient history, physical, and initial vital signs - the patient&#39;s initial presentation is concerning for heart failure/volume overload-&gt;pulmonary edema and bilateral pedal edema.&#34; He received ipratropium neb x1 and returned to facility. Neurology consulted (12/22/20), &#34;It is difficult to determine whether the patient has a new facial palsy or whether this is recrudescence of his previous stroke deficits. Given the swelling of his left face it is quite possible that there is inflammation causing some partial left facial nerve dysfunction that would not include the forehead. The pattern of weakness is, however, also consistent with what would be expected from his documented right MCA stroke. At this point it is appropriate to consider this a possible complication of his vaccination (Bell&#39;s palsy has been reported in some after Covid19 vaccination). However, I would not recommend any specific treatment for the facial weakness as the etiology is still somewhat unclear.&#34; Patient admitted to hospital 1/2/21-1/8/21 for mild hypothermia with possible AMS and found to have adenovirus. Head CT negative for CVA. Sepsis/toxic/metabolic w/u was unrevealing. Given IVF for diarrhea; C diff negative. Discharged to facility. Patient received 2nd COVID-19 pfizer vaccine on 1/13/21 in Right Deltoid w/o complications (lot#: EK9231, exp. 04/30/2021)

An 86-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: E19262; expiry date: not known), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm on 23Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included 2 heart surgeries- 1 triple and 1 double. Concomitant medications included lisinopril, metoprolol, and tamsulosin. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. On 24Jan2021 01:00 (reported as &#39;Sunday evening past midnight&#39;; pending clarification), the patient had to get up and run to the bathroom with a chronic case of diarrhea- the loose stool had a strong chemical stench. He did about 7 bowel movements all night until next morning. The patient asked if it was a reaction to the COVID-19 (vaccination). The reported events were assessed as non-serious. The outcome of the events was recovering.

Hospital Course:   COVID-19 pneumonia.  The patient was treated with convalescent plasma and IV remdesivir and completed the course.  He was treated initially with IV Decadron which has been transitioned to oral tablets for discharge to complete a 10-day course.   Chronic systolic heart failure.  Coronary artery disease.  Orthostatic hypotension in the setting of chronic hypertension.  The patient does have chronic systolic heart failure with an EF around 20% and is followed closely at the heart failure clinic.  He is chronically prescribed Lasix at 80 mg twice daily, however he did have some episodes of orthostatic hypotension during his hospitalization and has been unable to tolerate other guideline directed medical therapy due to his hypotension.  He is euvolemic at this time.  I have decreased his Lasix dosing to 40 mg twice daily to restart tomorrow morning.  His last dose of the 80 mg of Lasix was yesterday morning.  I do feel that in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and decreased oral intake that he is more at risk for continued hypotension and dehydration aggressive diuresis.  He will remain on aspirin, Plavix, and simvastatin.   Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His last hemoglobin A1c showed good control at 6.3 on 3/3/2021.  His glipizide was held while inpatient.  He was on long-acting Lantus insulin 10 units with stable blood sugars in the hospital.  He was also on correctional lispro insulin.  His glipizide will be resumed upon discharge.

Both are still continuing to date.  He has been to his infectious disease doctor, his cardiologist, and to his nephrologist.  Shortness of breath continues.  He has also developed edema in his legs.

An 88-year-old male patient received his first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number ER9231), via an unspecified route of administration on left arm on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood pressure high, diabetic and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had started no new medications and not had any other recent vaccinations. He took a lot of medications for a lot of things. He was diabetic, had high blood pressure, COPD, a variety of things get over the years, he took medication for these things. He was affected by medications more than most people. No further details provided about his medications. He reacted to medications in general and that because of that he usually took lower dosages. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. After 2 weeks from the vaccine. Have weakness and stomach pains and diarrhea. The patient had been artificially sick like 4-5 days since 21Jan2021, and had a test done and it didn&#39;t show up. He said he hadn&#39;t been anywhere to get the virus. He said he didn&#39;t have any fever, his oxygen level hadn&#39;t changed, he had a testing kit with thermometers, so he knew he never had a fever, but he got chills. He got all the symptoms, the stomach problems, diarrhea, back problems, overall weakness and low energy. He was fine two weeks before this, this started almost two weeks to the day and minute from when he went and got the shot. When he got the shot he had nothing, he waited 15-20 minutes with no problems, his arm was hurting for a couple days, but there was nothing else. Two weeks later he got basically an artificial case and the corona virus test said no, clarified to being negative, but he said it didn&#39;t go away, it had been from Thursday to Monday, so 5 days. The big problem was he was supposed to get his second shot Friday, and he had an appointment Wednesday, he would like to ask them too, but he would like to know was it dangerous for him to get the second shot. He didn&#39;t think he can get any sicker. He did not do a report online, he tried to get onto the website but nothing told him how to do it or whatever, so he stayed on the line waiting to talk to someone. Height: he was five feet and nine and three quarters inches tall, he had shrunk with age, everyone got smaller. His arm was not sore for very much, he didn&#39;t remember how long, he got sick two weeks later, and now he was really not well, though he was better than he was on Thursday or Friday, though he was not 100% yet. He would like to know if he should get the second shot, because he was too old to die from a corona virus shot. Investigations: He didn&#39;t know which COVID test they used, they did an instant test with results in an hour. The patient inquiry if he should get the second shot since he had had this artificial sickness for 5-7 days, two weeks after getting the vaccine. He had &#34;sore arm for a couple of days&#34; after the 1st injection, but &#34;nothing more&#34;. However, in the last 4-5 days, he&#39;s been feeling &#34;miserable&#34;. He didn&#39;t have fever. But he&#39;s been experiencing aching, diarrhea, upset stomach, lost weights and nasal drip. He tested negative to the COVID virus. He has a doctor&#39;s appointment scheduled this Wednesday. The outcome of events was unknown.

He was changing the bandage that day, he was changing his right sided ileostomy bag and he told her that blood shot out of it &#34;like a faucet.&#34; On 3Feb2021 was nerve wracking, but there was no blood.  He was changing his ostomy pad again on 04Feb2021 and it started bleeding so much that he went to the hospital. He was discharged within a few hours because &#34;they couldn&#39;t find anything wrong.&#34; He has had colitis for years and has an ileostomy, where they take out a bunch of his colon.  This week he has had some funny bleeding in his ileostomy.  It was spurting out blood.  He had to go to the ER on 4Feb2021 night because it was bleeding and then it stops. People in ER did not know what the bleeding was from.  He was bleeding in the ileostomy on 04Feb2021 and 05Feb2021.  On 05Feb2021 his ostomy bled a little bit more but it has not bled again since 06Feb2021. She also reports that he feels, &#34; icky, tired, no appetite and achy.&#34; The feeling unwell began on 7Feb2021. That worsened since loss of blood made him weaker and worried.

ER visit at the institution on 04Feb2021, 8pm to 11pm and released. They performed CT scan abdomen and Pelvis and IV. Results are unknown. Now he was good. The achiness and tiredness was between persistent and worsened. He was worrying now. She took his forehead temperature and it was good on 7Feb2021.  She took everybody&#39;s and they were all good.  He just feels icky and the blood thing is nerve wracking. He is convinced it is coming back. He was not on a blood thinner or anything listed on the vaccine fact sheet.

                                                Patient vaccinated with first dose of Pfizer with subsequent infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection. Initial H&amp;P reads in part as,  &#34;Patients symptoms began on or around Thursday 3/11 when he began to feel  fatigued. After two days of fatigue, he presented to an urgent care facility on  Saturday 3/13. He was noted to have a fever there and was diagnosed with a  presumed UTI, though patient reports at bedside that he has not had any  dysuria. He was treated with nitrofurantoin and increased his furosemide  temporarily per urgent care&#39;s recommendations. He then presented to the ER  on 3/15 with continued fatigue and a low blood pressure at home. We were unable  to clarify the method by which the blood pressure measurement was obtained  and/or if it was repeated. Antibiotics were changed to cephalexin at that time  despite a relatively clear UA. His daughter brought him back to the ER today  (3/18) due to persistent issues with low grade fevers in the 100-100.5 range,  significantly worsening fatigue, anorexia, and oxygen levels of 92-93% on  nonproductive cough. Does not have a home O2 requirement. In addition, he  endorses feeling chilled during the admission evaluation. Denies any chest pain,  nausea, vomiting, fevers, diarrhea, constipation. # Fever Progression of symptoms from Saturday 3/13 may constitute original presentation  of Covid-19. Presentations on 3/13 and 3/15 with dyspnea and fatigue. Initially  thought to be UTI and was treated with nitrofurantoin and cephalexin. UA on 3/15  in ED was negative for leuk esterase and nitrites. Tested positive for covid-19  on 3/18 with lymphopenia, 90-92% on room air. No home O2 req. Given duration  of symptoms and worsening fatigue and fevers, will admit for treatment of Covid- 19. Also considered CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation as explanations for  dyspnea. Possible CHF exacerbation as well given 1&#43; bilateral pitting edema to  mid-shin and JVD to ear lobe. Suspicion for COPD is low given no report of  increased sputum production and questionable history in chart to begin with.  Would be beneficial to clarify history with collateral history 3/19.&#34;
