He was able to respond to verbal commands, and never had complete LOC.  We were able to provide oral hydration and cold compresses.  After 15 mins I was able to have him sit in a chair, where he stated he was feeling much better.  After a total of 45 mins, he was able to walk out of clinic independently

                                                Patient received vaccine around 745 am on 4/22/21.  He did not have any side effects or concerns until 4/23/21 at approximately 9:30 am when he had what Mom describes as a grand mal seizure while at school.  Patient was reportedly sitting in his chair at school.  He stretched his arms above his head then fell onto the floor with full body convulsions for just under 1 minute.  Patient vomited about 20 minutes later.  Our office was informed by mother around 10:30 am.  Patient at home and sleeping.  Advised Mom to take patient to local ED for further evaluation and monitoring.

                                                Pt was seated in the waiting area after receiving his first dose of covid 19. His parents who also received the vaccine were waiting with him. I was preparing another dose for patients waiting for their covid vaccination. I heard pounding on the clinic room and ran to check. The mom had knocked on the door because her son had fallen out of his chair.. when I arrived he was on the floor and his parents said he was regaining consciousness and moved him in to a seated position. At this point another customer was calling 911. I had my technician call management.  I observed the patient and asked if he was doing ok. His parents asked him if he was hurt and he responded in the negative. The patient was feeling cold and his hands were &#34;cold and clamy&#34; according to his mom so I held off on the cold compress. He wanted water but was also nauseous so I told the parents that I do not want to risk aspiration. We gave him a bag to throw up. I recommended that they take him to get seen when the paramedics arrived as I was concerned about him shaking before fainting. At this point the paramedics arrived and he was taken to the hospital as he was not feeling well. I followed up with the patient&#39;s mom and she said all his tests came back normal (EKG, et) and that the doctors may think it could have been due to anxiety from getting the vaccine. She was really appreciative of the call.

Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Patient was given first dose and was in waiting area for observation.  About ten minutes after his shot our vaccine coordinator alerted me that he was having a reaction. When I went out to the patient his eyes were open but he was staring blankly. His father was shaking him and waving his hand in front of his face and asking him if he was okay and the patient was not responding. I also tried to get the patient to respond and he did not. Since the patient was not responsive to any questions we called 911. While waiting on the paramedics to arrive the patient came around and started to answer some simple questions. He was clammy and sweating and he threw up one time. When the paramedics arrived they took over. They checked all the patients vital signs  and were with him for about 15 or 20 minutes assessing him. The patient walked out of the store on his own and was not taken by ambulance.   I called the patient around 3:10pm to check on him and I spoke with him and he said he was doing fine.

Patient was sitting in the living room around 2030-2045 when he developed midsternal and epigastric region pain. Pain radiated to his upper middle back and down both left and right arms. There were no notable exacerbating or relieving factors. Pain was a 4-7 in severity. He was also nauseated. He was given tums by his mother without significant change in symptoms. After 45 minutes they decided to go to the ER. At ER labs were notable for elevated troponin (2-- &gt;15-- &gt;9). EKG with J-point elevation. Non-contrast CT chest/abd/pelvis was unremarkable. He was given ASA 325 and famotidine in the ED. Pain eventually subsided around 2345. He was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation of troponinemia.

Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

The stomach ache lasts for 2-3 hours after eating and then it subsides down until next meal. During this 2-3 hours of pain, initially he was feeling nausea, but never vomited. We have taken him to ER and PCP regarding this pain as the pain was severe and they could not conclude anything. They did do sonogram but could not find anything. Doctors suggested him to take Nexium and he is on it right now. Pain is subsiding a little but it is still there.

                                                The day following the second Pfizer shot the patient developed a fever to 101.5 that improved with Tylenol and did not recur.  On that same day he felt tingling in the hands and feet and reported a floating sensation.  This too resolved with resolution of fever.  On the third day after the shot he developed chest pain, difficulty taking a deep breath.  He woke up the following morning with nausea which resolved but the chest pain and a feeling that it was hard to take a deep breath worsened.  The pain was significant enough that he went to the ER.  In the ER, he was found to have an ECG consistent with acute pericarditis and his troponin was elevated (2.75, upper limits of normal 0.03).  He was started on IV Toradol and admitted to the hospital.  His troponin kept climbing so he was also given IVIG (80 gm).  The following morning his Troponin started coming down and he no longer was reporting any symptoms.

                                                Patient received his 2nd dose of the Pfizer vaccine and fainted approximately  minute after the dose was given. The patient&#39;s eyes rolled back as he fell to the floor where it appears that he had a mini seizure. We called for a code white and immediately began emergency procedures. I held the patient while he was sitting upright and kept speaking to him until he regain consciousness approximately 1 minute after he had syncope.  The patient seemed very confused because he had asked the question &#34;where am I,&#34; as he opened his eyes. He slowly became more alert as time passed by and was aware of his surroundings within the next 2 minutes.  He then stated that he was hot and hungry and was given water (from me) and Gatorade from his mother at his request. It was not long after that that the patient fully recovered and was back to normal. I had them stay and observed him for at least 40 minutes just to make sure that he was ok. Statements were taken from a salaried member of management during this time.  There was no medication needed and none given during this incident. Plans were made with patient&#39;s mother for a follow up and our contact information was given incase they needed to contact us for anything at all. I will reach out to them in the next 1-2 days to see how the patient is progressing.

                                                Patient received 1st dose of pfizer COVID vaccine 06/29/21. After administration, the patient and his family (brother and father) were instructed to wait the required 15 mins after receiving the vaccine. The patients brother and father stepped away to go to the bathroom while the patient stayed in the waiting area. The patient received the vaccine at 7:15p and the incident occurred at ~7:25p. The patient said they felt unwell to one of the techs in the pharmacy and they proceeded to get the pharmacist&#39;s attention. The pharmacist approached the patient and proceeded asking questions regarding the patient&#39;s symptoms. They patient stated they felt unwell and possibly needed to vomit. The pharmacist grabbed a trash can to give the patient and paged the father back to the pharmacy. The pharmacist stayed by the patient&#39;s side until the father returned and she informed him of what was going on. The patient stated this had happened previously when they received a vaccine ~1 year ago so it wasn&#39;t a first time occurrence. The pharmacist provided the patient with cold water and ensured they were okay to leave before letting them go after waiting the required 15 minutes. Patient is due back for the second dose on 7/20/21. Special precautions will be taken to ensure the patient is okay before leaving, including waiting 30 minutes due to a previous adverse reaction to the vaccine.

Just general pain and feeling terrible. I was bed ridden from Friday 25th June to Wednesday 30th June. My fever was up to 102 and was generally high throughout that time as well. I took ibuprofen and ate healthily, when I could eat though I had no appetite. I went to the DR and got a flu test on the 29th or 30th of June.

July 7 headache worse and nausea. July 8 headache so severe could not walk without pain shooting down back and pain with neck motion. Vomited 4 times and had to wear sun glasses even inside due to eye sensitivity. Patient had no fever no sore throat or cough. When he presented to the ED his neurological exam was normal but had mild nuchal rigidity/photophobia/and moderate severe headache.  As we worked him up the consideration was vaccine reaction versus viral meningitis. We gave him Toradol and Compazine as we awaited his test results and he felt significantly better. I was going to do a lumbar puncture if he was not improved. He ate and drank gatorade with  no nausea and was discharged with orders to return if symptoms worsened. He was instructed to see his doctor if not well in 3-4 days.

A 16-years-old male patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 30Apr2021 as dose 1, single (age at vaccination: 16 years) for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing crohn&#39;s disease. As far as family medical history, it was reported as none and father stated that his son is the only one in the family with Crohn&#39;s disease. Concomitant medication included ongoing infliximab (REMICADE) taken for crohn&#39;s disease and somatropin (NUTROPIN) taken as growth hormone, both started on unknown dates. The father stated that, after receiving the first dose of COVID vaccine, his son started developing symptoms Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP) which consists of the inflammation of small blood vessels. The symptoms began on or around 07May2021. On his son&#39;s legs it looked like a vasculitis. His son had these red blotches under his skin. It did not hurt and he also got vasculitis on his bowel. The symptoms first showed up as blotches on his legs and severe stomach pain. The pain is what alerted him. He was seen at the doctor on 04Jun2021, with a colonoscopy on 09Jun2021. He had a colonoscopy to diagnose the vasculitis on his bowel. It was stated that, the patient also had blood work that showed no abnormalities and a urine sample that did show blood which also indicates HSP. His son was being treated with steroids (treated right now with Prednisone 20mg daily). HSP is a chronic condition and his son has been dealing with it for the last month. The symptoms subsided and the doctor gave the ok to receive the second Covid 19 vaccine. Father reported that his son never had a positive Covid 19 virus test, the PCR test or the Rapid test. Also the patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date. About one week after the second Covid 19 vaccine the symptoms flared up again. Now he still had symptoms. He did have photographs of his son&#39;s legs he could share. He really did believe the HSP came from the Covid 19 vaccine, but that could be one in a million. The outcome of the events: First dose: Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and red blotches under his skin/blotches on his legs was not recovered and the outcome was unknown for rest of the events.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                10 days after receiving the first shot my son noticed blurred, wavy vision in his Right eye.  We took him to the eye doctor the next day where his vision was 20/60 in that eye and they found a spot on the back of his retina.  We were referred to a Retina Specialist. We saw Dr. two times where they determined he had had inflammation in the back of his eye and scar tissue was now in the place where the inflammation had been.  We were told surgery would be needed to remove scar tissue and hopefully correct his vision a few lines.  We decided to get a second opinion since we still didn&#39;t have any answers regarding what caused this to happen, if it was going to get worse and if he could possibly get it in his other eye.  We just saw another Dr. where he confirmed that surgery was necessary to try to repair damage.  His vision at this appointment was 20/100.  They do believe it is stable but has fluctuated between 20/60 and 20/100.  Dr. mentioned that he has another patient about the same age who had the same thing happen at about the same time as our son&#39;s eye condition began.  I have since also found several cases around the world with similar experiences.

Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

                                                Started Saturday, April 17 around 9am with nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting bile (this started 23-24 hours after the vaccine; no other side effects).  The focus of the pain was on the lower right side of his abdomen, and when he tried to stand up straight the pain increased in intensity and he felt like it was &#34;pulling&#34;.  With all the vomiting the pain spread to most of the abdomen, but after getting Zofran and resting that additional area subsided.  He was evaluated at Medical Center and ultimately transferred to hospital for appendectomy on April 17 around 5pm.  Appendectomy was done early morning Sunday, April 17 and he was discharged home that afternoon

A 17-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 28Apr2021 16:00 as unknown, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fish oil; magnesium [magnesium citrate]; vitamin d [vitamin d nos]; probiotic [bifidobacterium lactis]; vitamin b complex (VITAMIN B). The consumer stated, approximately 20 minutes after receiving the vaccine (28Apr2021 16:15) the patient felt dizzy, eyesight was blurry, and he began to shake and jerk. It resembled a seizure. His skin turned pale, heart rate was high, and he felt nauseous. It took him approximately 5-10 minutes to feel &#34;normal&#34; again. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The adverse event result in emergency room/department or urgent care. There is no treatment for AE. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The outcome of the events was resolving.  Information about Batch/Lot no. has been requested.

He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

                                                Patient fainted (loss consciousness) a couple of minutes after receiving injection. Mom caught him and called for help and reported his eyeballs rolled up and he started down when she caught him. by time Pharmacist and store staff got there (less than a minute) he had regained consciousness but very lightheaded. No breathing difficulty. So got a chair and had him sit with head down and store staff observing. After another 10min he still reported lightheaded and nausea, so ambulance was called. When they arrived and checked him out everything checked out normal and he was feeling better so they released him to his parents care. Called on 5/24/21 at 10:10am and spoke to mom who reported he was doing fine and no apparent after effects.

                                                Patient received the Pfizer vaccine in the morning, then woke at about midnight. He went to get a drink of water, and was holding a glass of water in his hand. He started to feel as if the room was spinning, became very sweaty, had ringing in both ears, and lost consciousness, striking his head on the counter. The event was unwitnessed. He reports waking approximately 1 hour later with a bad headache. He had a headache and felt disoriented. He denies urinary/bowel incontinence or tongue biting. He was able to walk back to his room without difficulty, took ibuprofen, and went back to sleep. He woke the next morning with nausea and vomited, but this did not impact his headache. He has not had any notable neurologic symptoms since that time, but continues to have a minor headache. He has not had any further vomiting. Headache has not subsequently woken him from sleep and does not worsen with recumbent positioning. He denies visual changes, memory changes, difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath, ringing in his ears, or dizziness. He says his headache is located mostly around his forehead and at the top of his head that is now mild and feels like pressure ?like a tension type headache.? His mother is a nurse, and evaluated him the next day. The family did not feel that he needed to be seen in the emergency department, or prior to this visit. He has not had any previous episodes that were similar. Patient was evaluated in my clinic. Complete neurologic exam was within normal limits. He has been referred to neurology for further assessment.

She states the hives were huge in size also that he also had diarrhea 24 hours after his vaccine. He was taken to the ER to get checked out.

He was given Benadryl for 5 days straight at the ER which helped to decrease his symptoms.  His mother states he is no longer having the hives or diarrhea.

                                                Patient evaluated at local hospital for concern for meningitis / encephalitis, transferred to our facility and was able to get studies (detailed below some of which are still pending).   Initial symptoms presented with rhinorrhea, then severee headache, neck pain, and fever (tactile). Had sweats and chills. Began to experience diarrhea, dysuria, diffue body aches and myalgias. Severe pain in his neck / posterior occiput. Denied any mental status changes at the time.   Studies largely negative for an identifiable bacterial process so presumptive diagnosis is aseptic meningitis. Unclear if from vaccine or other etiologies. Outside hospital had started antibiotics but this was stopped and patient symptomatically recovered with only symptomatic care.

                                                Approximately 24 hours  after secondPfizer dose, 17 year old male awoke in the morning and was complaining of intense throat pain radiating into the upper chest  relieved by sitting up.  NSAIDS not helpful, went to narcotic med to relieve, which it did with single tab of medication.  Other symptoms, fatigue, body aches, low fever.  Waxed and waned over 48 hour time period from onset, with another intense episode  of throat/chest pain 24 hours in from onset requiring narcotic pain med to relief.   Again this was in the morning.  One episode of vomiting during second intense period with what looked like water that just hadn&#39;t gone down his throat, and following this he reported some relief from what he described as a radiating burning sensation up under the lower jaw and radiating into the upper chest.  No shortness of breath ever.   Burning sensation in throat and chest resolved by 72 hours with no more episodes of the acute throat and chest pain after the two episodes.  While ED was considered due to the distress being experienced, we decided against since the narcotic med was helping and no shortness of breath was being experienced.  I did try to get on with the CDC to report my concerns when it was happening to see if others were reporting this, then because it was a concerning reaction, but site was difficult to navigate and I was trying to monitor.  I did not call the pediatrician at that time as I am a health care worker and felt I could assess and make decisions based on findings.   Following the recent reports of myocarditis in teens, especially males, I felt obligated to report this experience.   This child has no history of heart ailment.  No tests were done to assess what might have been the cause.  I assumed it was an outside-the-box reaction to the second Pfizer dose.

He had other flu-like symptoms but he said it was difficult for him to swallow. He still had a fever of 100.9 and it lasted until the fourth day. The following day it was not much better so we went to the doctor and all tests were negative. It was still sore until the fifth day and then it subsided. We tried some Tylenol and Ibuprofen and it helped the fever but not the sore throat. It has been six days and he is fully recovered.

They seemed to worsen throughout day &amp; with laying down. Then, increasing pain along left side of body into hip and leg around 5:30pm. He experienced very &#34;bad, cramp-like&#34; pain in left calf area around 6:30pm. Sharp Chest pains intermittent at &#34;10 pain level&#34; &amp; lower left leg at &#34;8 pain level&#34;. Some nausea and vomited once at this point. We called the urgent care line for our doctor&#39;s office and spoke with  nurse who instructed us to go to the ER. They performed ECG and Chest XR. Labs were BMP, CBC, CK, D-dimer (quantitative), &amp; Triponon-I.  They gave 800mg Motrin, IV fluids and keterolac in IV. They said they &#34;did not identify a specific problem&#34; but to rest, take ibuprofen, and follow-up with doctor and cardiologist. They said it was most likely related to the Covid-19 vaccination but could not give causation.  Patient seems fine so far today, but still has medication in system.

(Unsure of which Tdap or lot#) at 11:30 pm 6/18/2021 he was fine. About 30 mins later he was hit hard with side effects. Said he was very shaky and felt hot and cold at the same time. He did not let me know about this until this morning around 7:50 am 06/19/2021 about how he was feeling and he was still feeling very bad, advised him to take tylenol and he took that and went back to sleep. Around 12:00 PM 06/19/2021 I was finally able to check his temperature and other vitals. His temperature was normal, but his heart rate was 138 bpm. I made him sit down and relax for a bit and heart rate leveled out to normal.  He also reported he is afraid to eat that he feels nauseous. As of this afternoon 06/19/2021 he seems to be feeling better.

                                                On 06/02/2021, (23 days after vaccine) the patient and his identical twin brother were at dinner when patient had shortness of breath and chest pain.  They brought the patient to Medical Center where a CT of the chest was performed to rule out a pulmonary embolus.   No pulmonary embolus  was identified and patient was transferred the patient via ambulance to  Hospital to the intensive care unit.  He was noted to have an elevated troponin, an elevated BNP and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. He underwent a cardiac MRI on 06/04/2021 documenting delayed enhancement in the inferior and inferolateral walls of the left ventricle consistent with myocarditis.  The patient&#39;s chest pain was quite severe and was only relieved once he was in the intensive care unit at Hospital.  He did well for 2-3 days and did not require inotropes but his troponin vacillated and his ejection fraction remain low.  He was given IVIG non 06/05/2021 after his echo showed an ejection fraction between 37 in 45%. He subsequently developed headache emesis and neck pain.   On hospital day 5, the father was quite concerned for his son and thought ?he was going to die?.   The father shared pictures of the edematous, pale son that he took with his phone. He improved over the next 1-2 days and was discharged from the hospital with an ejection fraction on 06/07/21 of 62%.

                                                Patient is a 17 year old male with only past medical history of anemia at 1 year of age (resolved with iron and vit C supplementation), who presented to an Hospital on 7/7/21 with 2 days of chest pain radiating to his L arm, generalized upper extremity weakness, SOB, vomiting, found to have an an elevated troponin level of 0.626 with ST segment elevation on EKG, echo reportedly normal.   Patient reportedly tested positive for COVID-19 on 6/6  and subsequently went into quarantine, was re-tested on 6/21 and tested negative.  He arrived on 6/28 and received his 1st dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 07/03/21.  Of note, he was told he might feel dizziness and arm achiness after the vaccine but denies he was informed about possible inflammation of or around the heart after the vaccine.  On 7/5 he was awakened in the morning by chest pain 6/10 and shortness of breath that started in the right lower sternal border and progressively moved to the left lower sternal border and then to his L shoulder and arm which he describes as feeling like he had been &#34;punched&#34; or a constant achy feeling.  He took Tylenol x1 on Monday with minimal improvement.  He initially thought it was reflux pain and took tums but it did not improve.  He had one hour of relief but then the pain returned.  He reportedly felt dizzy Monday evening as well.  The pain was absent on Tuesday, but he woke up this morning again with the same chest pain and shortness of breath, prompting him to seek medical attention.  In the outside ED, he had one NBNB emesis that was not preceded by nausea.  En route from Hospital to Hospital he complained of chest pain 7/10 for which he was placed on 2L O2 which reduced the pain to 4/10.  During his admission his troponin levels initially up trended and peaked at 5.67 before beginning to downtrend.  He was diagnosed with myopericarditis and started on ibuprofen three times a day around the clock. He was discharged home on 7/8 with specific return precautions, follow-up appointment with cardiology, and strict instructions to avoid exercising and strenuous exercising until cleared by cardiology.

Subsequently his mother screamed out for help, I ran over took his pulse, which was present but slightly faint, and almost used the epipen but he came back to consciousness before it was injected. Upon inital observation when I came over the patient was very pale and sweaty. We called 911 and shortly thereafter the medics took him to emergency room.

On Friday afternoon (7/9) when he was at work washing dishes where he had some physical exertion he began to notice at 16:30-17:00 that he developed substernal, sharp, 7/10 chest pain that did not radiate, improve/worsen with deep breaths, sitting up, laying down or with movement of his upper extremities. It worsened towards the end of the night and peaked at 8/10 by 22:00-23:00 that same evening. His sister picked him up from work per his regular routine and he went home and took a shower which improved the pain to a 5-6/10 when he went to sleep. He woke up at 3 AM on Saturday (7/10) AM and had one episode of NBNB emesis associated with the chest pain. When he woke up later that morning he felt improved until 10-12 AM he developed mild chest pain again which he took Tums for. He also tried Motrin which did not help his pain at all. On the morning of admission (7/11), he woke up at 6-7 AM with upper right back pain, dyspnea, and nausea along with the persistent chest pain which prompted him to present to MFSH. He does endorse mild sore throat but denies any fevers, recent sick contacts, known COVID-19 exposure or previous history of COVID-19. There is a family history of cardiac disease including a fatal MI in his father. His mother&#39;s family also has a history of heart disease and both sides have a history of high cholesterol. He did add Whey Protein recently to his diet to for muscle building, but he DENIES any drug, alcohol, tobacco, vaping, marijuana, THC use. He does not play any sports regularly. He also denies any recent bug/tick bites or rashes.

But then he complained of stomach ache as well. We went to the hospital in June and they have done so many tests on him though and he was referred to a GI DR as well. He gets a stomach ache after having full meals, like anything normal size he used to eat, he gets nausea. He passes stool that is yellow in color. The DRs are still working on him currently though. He has some sort of bug or something. We have tried Pepto bismol and other over the counter medications but they have not helped.

                                                This is a 18 y.o. male who is generally healthy. He received a second dose of the SARS2-COV vaccine on 3/4. The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

During that time, patient experienced headache and nausea. Patient did mention that he usually eats right after waking up but on 3/31/21 he didnt eat anything in the morning. His parents gave him water and he felt a lot better. Pharmacist called 911 because we thought that his throat was closing up but it was just nausea and his spit was coming up. After the 911 came they checked him out and he was doing okay and felt much better and did not had to go to emergency room. He was okay and then left after 30 minutes of observance. I also called the patient at around 4 pm to make sure he was okay and patient said he was fine and was felling normal like before.

Question is whether he should get the second shot or not. Is 6 to potentially 8 days of side effects a concern? Also, parent has been curious as to whether son was a long hauler from covid for brain fog but son thinks it could be burnout from school. Strange that  had such a long lasting reaction compared to to others his gneral age, including those who had covid after he had it so longer ago.

The vomiting stopped after having some water and saltine crackers. Took vitals at 10:02 am heart rate 82, o2 100%, and BP 116/61. I checked to see how the patient was doing and he stated that he was doing better. We released the patient with parents who were here to get there second vaccines. Patient was released at 10:14 am.

                                                Patient received vaccine around 5 pm. For the first two minutes after vaccination the patient seemed to be fine. Starting around that 3rd minute the patient got very dizzy and nauseous. He was then seated to prevent further NV. I asked the patient if they were breathing ok and the patient stated his breathing was fine. After about another minute the patient&#39;s eyes got glossy and the patient seemed to be out of it. I asked multiple orienting questions such as his name, where he was, and what day of the week it is. He was only able to answer the day of the week and his head was bobbing. I then called 911 as the patient became very pale and started to profusely sweat. While on the phone with the 911 operator, the patient went completely unconscious and lost control of motor functions. I was able to confirm the patient was still breathing and still had a heart rate (although rapid) and thus compressions were not given. The EMT arrived quickly to the scene and took over care of the patient. After about 20 minutes of checking vital signs, the EMT gave the patient and his family the option on whether they want to go to the hospital or not for further examination. The family decided they wanted to take the ambulance to the hospital.

                                                The morning after my shot maybe 12 hours later I woke up with a 104.5° fever and my right armpit was the size of a tennis ball and hurt a lot. I was extremely tired I could not go to work.  I did not eat all day but I did take a lukewarm shower and some Tylenol.. About 5 PM my fever broke and it still took another 24 hours for me to feel myself again. It has been five weeks and I still have a golf ball sized lump in my right armpit even after massaging it and exercising and sweating every day.

This activity lasted for approximately 1 minute.  Patient also felt dizzy, sweaty,  nauseous, and became pale. Patient was given a cold ice pack to lower his body temperature. Patient was also given crackers for nausea, and a bag just incase he had to vomit. Patient&#39;s mother was also here to tend to the patient. The mother also gave him clear fluids (sprite) to help with the nausea.  After approximately 10 minutes, the patient was able to stand without feeling dizzy. He left the store with his mother to be watched closely (His mother is a nurse.) They also refused emergency medical services.

I began to have random chest/heart pressure when breathing out/ swallowing food or drinks. I began to rest and took ibuprofen (Motrin) to relive my side effects. I soon began to feel more or less the same symptoms  on the 26th and 27th of May. On the 28th I woke up to the sides of my stomach hurting, but went away once I ate breakfast. Days go by and I felt my symptoms going down. Around May 30th to June 1st, sometime in between I felt that my symptoms had been relived, As of June 6th, the day I am reporting this event I have not felt what I felt during those days.

About 5 minutes later while still being seated in the same seat, Pt started to look like he was going to pass out. His mother tried to keep him engaged and alert by talking to him. I raised his legs to see if it would help. Then, relatively soon after Pt&#39;s upper body and face began to shake and he started to foam from the mouth. We lowered him to the ground and placed him on his side. The &#34;seizure&#34; lasted less than 30 seconds. When Pt became alert and aware he stated he just had a &#34;4 hour dream&#34;. When the paramedics arrived 5  minutes later we had Pt seated in a chair again and he had drank some water. About 5-10 minutes later he began to feel nauseated  and vomited. The paramedics transported Pt to the hospital.

At that point I stayed with the patient and called for my pharmacist. The patient lost consciousness, and by the time my pharmacist got there he was stable and coherent. Once my pharmacist assessed the situation she had me call 911 for paramedics.  We had him lay on the floor with a pillow under his head, feet elevated.  We provided ice water, nuts as a snack, and I dabbed sweat from his forehead while holding an ice pack to his forehead. I stayed with the patient and patients girlfriend until paramedics arrived for transport.

                                                Allergy to red meat became prevalent again. Since becoming allergic to red meat in the summer of 2020, I had gained a tolerance to red meat to the point where I could consume as much as I wanted. This lasted between August 2020 and the date listed in this report. On that date I consumed red meat and had an allergic reaction to it. The reaction was a swelling of the fingers, hives on the arms and knees and wrist. As I didn?t have any reactions to red meat in the previous 10 months I didn?t make the connection that I was allergic to red meat again. The following Monday I consumed more red meat. That night I was very drowsy and went to bed at 1900. At around 0100 Tuesday morning I woke up with a terrible stomach ache and could feel my hands itching. I tried to go back to sleep. At around 0430 I woke up again with completely swollen hands to the point where I couldn?t bend any joint in them, hives on my wrists, knees, elbows, neck, forehead, back, and back of thighs. I went to the hospital for a severe allergic reaction. This is the exact same allergic reaction that I would have when I consumed red meat in June 2020 at the height of my allergy, but I had never had a reaction like it since then. Now I am sensitive to red meat again and I can?t think of any reason except that I received the vaccine. I have not consumed red meat since.

                                                Patient came in for his first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine.  He received his shot in his left arm (given @ 1:20pm on 07/29/2021).  He went to our waiting area for his 15 minutes of observation.  As soon as he sat down he start to have a reaction (1:22pm 07/29/2021).  He became unconscious.  His mother was with him and alerted the vaccinator (pharmacy technician) immediately.  Technician alerted the pharmacist/pharmacy manager.  Pharmacist ran out to check on patient.  I yelled and shook the patient.  He became alert.  He was no longer unconscious at this point.  He began sweating, his eyes kept closing.  He complained of feeling nauseated and having a headache.  Pharmacist immediately called 911.  Paramedics arrived (@ 1:40pm).  They check his vitals.  BP was 80/59. Patient then alerted the paramedics that he had to use the restroom.  He has been having diarrhea for at least the past 3 days.  Paramedics took him to the restroom.  He then was asked to have a seat outside of the restroom where his vitals were done again.  They started an IV and ran an EKG (@ 1:55pm).  Paramedics brought in stretcher and were taking him to the hospital for further observation (@2:10pm).

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

Vaccinator describes 20-30 seconds of full body shaking. Patient then awoke and was Alert and oriented to people, place and time within 2 minutes. He was nauseas and anxious initially. Onsite EMS was alerted immediately and came to access the patient. 911 was also called quickly under the assumption it may have been a seizure. Patient denied any seizure history. Father arrived a few hours later to pick up patients vehicle and dog. Father informed me that patient was doing better at this point and was being prepared for departure.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

A 19-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 01Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation  .  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced severe stomach pain on 06Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered. The reported event was considered an Important Medical Event.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: on 10Apr2021 and  computerised tomogram: on 10Apr2021  .    Course of the event. The reporter stated that  her 19 year old son had his first vaccine on 01Apr2021, they didn&#39;t know anything and on 07Apr2021 he got severe stomach pain in the middle of the night. The reporter said they tried to self medicate, that maybe he was just dehydrated because he had been outside. The reporter says they went to the ER on 10APR2021 with the same pains but they couldn&#39;t find anything on the CAT scan. The reporter says they gave him something to relax his stomach, she can&#39;t remember what, and that it appeared to work but now he is off work with severe stomach pains. She says they changed what he ate, they are not sure what happened.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

To ED via w/c. 1310: report to nurse. 1315: c/o HA at this time, no change in vision sx, with nurse.    ED Note: A 19 y.o. male with a history of multiple prior RUE surgeries and tree nut allergy who presents with blurred vision. In the ED, he is very well appearing and in NAD. VS WNL. On physical exam, he is neurovascularly intact. On ophthalmalgic exam, his pupils at 5 mm bilaterally briskly reactive (does have some light sensitivity), painless full EOM, normal visual fields. On my testing of visual acuity, mildly decreased in the left; however on Doctor it is was mildly decreased in the right. Overall no significant deficit in visual acuity. Patient denies ocular trauma. No ocular pain. Sclera/conjunctiva is not injected.    I feel presentation is most likely an adverse reaction to the vaccination. Not consistent with allergic reaction. Overall his examination is reassuring against an acute ocular emergency. Patient does also state that his symptoms are improving. Received Benadryl in triage. Will report and call Pfizer, poison control, and ophtho.

Within minutes I had a metallic taste, which I figured was no big deal where I was then released. Within minutes after I had some malaise all throughout the rest of the day which lead to eventually feeling extremely tired and worn out. Today I&#39;m feeling very ill and sore still, with some abdominal pain on my left side and I&#39;m tasting a lot of blood which started up around 10 am.

                                                I first experienced a headache ~20 minutes after vaccination (11:15 AM). It faded, and I  felt generally unwell and tired throughout the afternoon. Around 10:30 PM, I experienced serious chills and generally felt like I had a fever. These symptoms worsened into the night, as did the fever (measured at 102 degrees F, possibly higher at the peak). I also experienced a headache, mild nausea, joint (knee) pain, although some symptoms may have been due to dehydration. Despite being very tired, I was unable to really fall asleep. At around 6 AM the fever finally dropped substantially, and as of 8:30 AM is currently only 99.4 degrees. I am still experiencing a bit of a headache as well, but the other symptoms are gone.

A 19-year-old male patient received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0187, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 22May2021 11:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. The Patient&#39;s medical history (including any illness at time of vaccination) was none and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of historical vaccine, bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot number: EW0176, NDC number and Expiration date are Unknown) via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 01May2021 10:30 (at the age of 19-years-old) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Additional vaccines administered on same date of the pfizer suspect were none. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. Adverse events following prior vaccinations were none. Family medical history relevant to adverse events was none. Relevant tests were unknown. It was reported that her 19-year-old son got the 2nd dose of the vaccine on 22May2021 and 2 days later on 24May2021, he wound up with chest pain and the caller took him to emergency room and the patient was diagnosed with myocarditis and admitted to the hospital. The Reporter clarified the patient&#39;s chest pain started when he woke up around 08:30-09:00. On an unspecified date in May2021 at 23:30, the patient had a fever starting about 12 hours from receiving the second dose and it lasted for 24 hours, and the patient didn&#39;t feel well on an unspecified date in May2021. At one point he didn&#39;t want to wake his parents up around 11:30 p.m. but he was warm on an unspecified date in May2021. At 0600am the next day, the caller took the patient&#39;s temperature, and his fever was 100.9 Fahrenheit. The caller carried the patient to the emergency room on 24May2021 due to his chest pain. It was reported that patient&#39;s EKG was extremely irregular and caller stated that if it was her or her husband&#39;s EKG, they would have been having an MI, but since the patient was only 19, the doctors didn&#39;t think MI was possible. The patient was then diagnosed with myocarditis. It was reported that the patient experienced diarrhea on 24May2021. Chest Pain required a visit to Emergency Room on 24May2021 and the patient was hospitalized from 24May2021 to 26May2021. It was reported that, the patient received treatment with Colchicine 0.6 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26may2022) one tablet by mouth twice a day. The patient came home from the hospital with this prescription on 26May2021 and he is still taking this medication. Prescribed to take it twice daily for a month. Famotidine, it is like a Pepcid. 20 mg (NDC number and Lot number: unknown, Expiration Date: 26Mayy2021) one tablet by mouth twice a day for 6 days, because of the heavy dose of ibuprofen and diarrhea. The patient had completed this medication. Ibuprofen 600 mg (NDC number, Lot number: unknown and Expiration Date: unknown) 1 tablet by mouth three times a day for six days and this has script had ended. Caller stated that her son was recovered but that he was still taking the treatment medications at this time. Caller stated that her son&#39;s symptoms are improved, he was not complaining of chest pain anymore, she assumes his myocarditis was improved because he was not complaining of the chest pain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 100.9 Fahrenheit on an unspecified date in May2021, EKG (electrocardiogram): extremely irregular on 24May2021, PCR COVID test (sars-cov-2 test): negative on an unspecified date in May2021 while in the hospital. Caller stated the patient had an EKG showing irregular heartbeat.It was reported that the patient had tests but she didn&#39;t have results available and the patient had a PCR COVID test in the ER. Caller stated that all of this was related to the vaccine. Caller also stated that she is wondering if her son would have reacted differently if he had gotten the Moderna, but caller and her husband had gotten Pfizer and didn&#39;t have any problems. Reporter seriousness for Myocarditis, diarrhea and fever was unspecified. The outcome of the events, Myocarditis, chest pain, diarrhea and irregular heartbeat was recovering and for fever was recovered on an unspecified date in May2021 and for other events was recovered on an unspecified date in 2021.  Additional information requested.

I advised for the mother andp atient to stay a little longer to take another set of vital signs.. I took the third set at 10.41 am BP 135/95, Temp 97.6 F, Pulse 77, Oxygen 99%. The patient looked fatigued so I called code assist at 10.44 am. The code team  arrived and took over.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

                                                Patient experienced syncope/fainting episode approx 15 mins after vaccination. Patient stood from chair and complained of nausea, asked for water. Legs buckled, patient fell to knees. Did not fall all the way to floor or experience head/body trauma. Patient was attended to by supervising pharmacist, and subsequently moved into chair with assistance. Pulse and respirations were normal, but patient was pale, diaphoretic, and complained of nausea and dizziness for another 15-20 minutes. No epinephrine or diphenhydramine was indicated or administered. Patient was observed until approximately 8:30pm, at which time he had made a full recovery.  Patient left under his own power, and safely travelled to his home. Pharmacist called to check on patient and spoke with him twice (4/29, 9:50pm...4/30, 4:30pm). Patient reports feeling fine, no residual effects. Is eager to receive his second dose on 5/20/21.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

                                                At approximately 12:30 PM on May 26, 2021, Pt. began vomiting while he was at school.  Prior to vomiting, school staff reported that he seemed unwell (pt. is severely disabled and has very limited speech).  The first episode of vomiting was followed by multiple (4-5) episodes of vomiting blood.  School staff including the school nurse report observing clots in the blood, bright red blood, and brown coffee ground type blood in the vomit.  The school staff called 911 and pt. was transported to Hospital.  In the ambulance pt. vomited again and the paramedic reported observing blood in the vomit. Pt. was observed in the ER and given Zofran and liquids.  Blood tests and a CT scan with and without contrast were performed.  Neither tests explained the bloody vomiting. Pt has since stopped vomiting and is resting quietly at home and eating normally.  The hospital referred Noah to a Gastroenterologist for follow up.

A 20-year-old male patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number and expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 13May2021 at 11:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient is very strict on his health. The patient is a vegetarian, he is very health conscious. The patient did not receive any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the COVID vaccine. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 on Apr2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced tenderness at the shot site and was very tired. On the morning of 14May2021, the patient had a small temperature that was one degree higher than before and the patient was wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired. Then the patient started experiencing chest pain within days of the second dose. The patient woke up on 15May2021 with chest pain that was persistent through 18May2021. On 19May2021, the chest pain got worse. The reporter thought the patient had indigestion so she gave the patient Tylenol, Pepcid, and clear soda and the patient felt a little better. On 20May2021, the patient was clutching his chest and had pain in his left arm. The patient couldn&#39;t talk, the pain was so hard. The patient went to the emergency room at 12:00 and the healthcare team said that the patient was experiencing a heart attack (reported time of heart attack was 10:00). The patient was not admitted to the hospital. They said the chemical that the large muscle in the heart makes, it was elevated which was how they determined it was a heart attack. These lab numbers were drawn every three hours and they came down but never went away. The patient had two Troponin draws and they were both elevated. They also did an EKG on the patient which showed a heart attack. The patient was told to see a cardiologist and was sent home. The reporter is watching the patient and the patient is still in a little bit of pain but not as much. The patient went to his primary care provider on the day of the report and the doctor doesn&#39;t see this as a displaced issue. The doctor does not know what would cause this in the heart. The patient is to see the cardiologist on Tuesday, 25May2021. The reporter is unsure if this is related to the vaccine but it was almost a week after the patient&#39;s second dose. The outcome of the event small temperature that was one degree higher than before was recovering and the outcome of the event wiped out tired-extremely exhausted and tired was not recovered. The outcome of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested

In brief, 20-year-old neurologically normal man with history of asthma now presenting with new onset fever, headache and then status epilepticus. On 5/25 the patient received his second dose of COVID vaccine and then started to have intermittent fevers up to 102.5.  This was associated with malaise, nausea, fever, headache, myalgias.  He came to ED on 5/30 and had IVF, analgesics and a cardiac workup that was unremarkable and was discharged with diagnosis of possible pericarditis/myocarditis.  He then had ongoing worsening headaches and increasing fevers and was unable to get out of his bed, and so his wife called 911 and he came to ED on 6/3.  There he had vomiting and transaminitis and was diagnosed with gastroenteritis treated with flagyl. Headaches progressed and were associated with dizziness; he had HCT read as unremarkable but then while awaiting MRI had convulsion.  He was returned to his room and had two more and thus was intubated, placed on propofol/versed, Keppra, dilantin, and broad-spectrum antibiotics and acyclovir before transfer to UCSF. on 6/5/2021 found to have reduced urine output, and serum creatinine found to be 1.72 and climbed &gt;7 in days later normalized spontaneously with fluid support to 4.26 with continued improvement.  LFTs were also found to be elevated.  Was acutely encephalopathic. Seizures resolved on Keppra treatment though had acute agitation for several days. Slowly returning to neurologic baseline. with AKI and LFTs slowly normalizing.

This The reporter reported for a 20-year-old male patient (Reporter&#39;s son) via medical information team.  A 20-years-old male patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Lot Number: Unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 (20-year-old at the time of vaccination) as 1st dose, single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included illness from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. The reporter also stated that there are no mental health issues noted in their family history. The reporter also stated that the patient was overall healthy with no significant medical history in the past. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The reporter reported that patient received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine on Saturday and by Monday was having flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. He has been to the doctor for sick visits 20 times in 20 years. After receiving the COVID 19 vaccines, the patient has been seen by the doctor 3 times in one week. The patient&#39;s side effects have lasted 3-4 weeks. The reporter would like to know commonly reported side effects of the vaccine and their duration. The reporter would like to know the efficacy of only one dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine as the patient was hesitant to get the 2nd dose due to the side effects noted from the 1st vaccine. The reporter was advised per &#34;attached&#34; dose for efficacy after one dose. The reporter was not satisfied with this data and wanted to know more about what she had been read about online. The reporter was advised caller agent as could do some more research and contact her back with possible additional data which caller agreed to doing. Upon call back on 14Jun2021, advised caller per (website &#34;PRIVACY&#34;) from 10Dec2020. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients began to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, and 52.4% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval: 29.5, 68.4) was observed between dose 1 and dose 2, indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. Two doses of vaccine provide the maximum protection observed. Ten cases of severe COVID-19 were observed with onset after the first dose. Nine cases occurred among placebo recipients and one among BNT162b2 recipients. The reporter would like to know dosing interval between shot one and two. Patient had their 1st dose on 14May2021 and has not received the 2nd dose yet due to side effects from what they felt was caused by the 1st dose of Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine. The reporter received response as &#34;you should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine if you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the vaccine or if you had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient of the vaccine. The decision to receive the second dose for any other reason cannot be made by Pfizer. We refer you to speak to your healthcare provider about the risks of the vaccine compared to the risks of potentially not being fully protected against COVID-19 infection. Your healthcare provider knows your health situation and has access to information that can better help inform this decision&#34;. The reporter wanted to know should the patient get the 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine after the reported side effects of flu like symptoms, fevers, chills, diarrhoea, chest pain, shakiness, as well as other neurological symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The reporter received response as do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The outcome of the events was resolved in 2021  Follow-up attempts are needed. Information about lot/batch number has been requested

Pharmacist on duty instructed the patient to lay down facing up and started taking his blood pressure every 3 mins while giving the patient the electrolyte Vitamin drink( similar to Gatorade). His blood pressure and pulse readings were 100/60 (60), 93/51 (54), 104/62(68); 101/68(62), 108/79(67),109/79(67). So his blood pressure and pusle went down  for 1 reading then it went back to his normal reading of 109/79 within 10 mins. After laying down for 15 mins and drinking vitamin drink, pt felt better as his nausea/dizziness went away. He felt okay and left the pharmacy at 11:30am. Pt reported no reactions to any vaccines before. His girlfriend called the dad to report the incident and the dad told her that his twin brother experienced the same reaction earlier today when receiving his covid vaccine at another site. His brother felt fine after 30 mins monitoring

                                                I had a large amount of pain in my stomach.; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer.   A 20-year-old male patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 18Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0162) as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient previously took BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 28Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8730) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunisation.  The patient stated on 18Apr2021, &#34;I had a large amount of pain in my stomach. The pain was almost to the point where I was considering going to the hospital and it took multiple ibuprofen to even be able to sleep. This pain lasted for about two days before subsiding. The symptom I had did not seem to be one of the listed symptoms of the vaccine so I was a little worried for a day about what the pain could be&#34;.  The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and not been tested for COVID-19. The event was reported to have led to hospitalization. The outcome of the event was recovered on an unspecified date.   No follow-up attempts are possible; information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.

                                                First dose: Dec 16 Symptoms spanning 36 hours after injection as well as occasional joint pain in left elbow, wrist and knuckles. 36hr symptoms included: Fever, fatigue, muscle and joint pain in legs and arms, chills. 2nd dose, jan 6: Symptoms spanning ~60 hours (two days following vaccination &#43; day of vaccination)Symptoms included: headache, low grade fever, muscle and joint pain in legs and both arms, chills. Symptoms almost completely resolved after that period, occasionally had some very mild joint pain still.*Note after both doses, pain in left arm was more severe than right arm* Starting the night of Jan 22 (fri) started having light leg pain, which carried into the 22nd. Dismissed it as too much walking the next day.Jan 24: leg pain a bit more severe, from a 1-2 to a 2-3. Included joint pain in left knee and ankle. Jan 25: pain in both legs at a 3-4, also mild pain in left arm (1-2) as well as joint pain. Jan 26: pain in left arm more severe, leg pain similar in severe. Very mild pain in right arm starting that evening, though only in upper arm. No joint pain in right arm Jan 27: pain in left arm similar in severity, slight increase in right arm pain, would rate 2-3 in right arm, 3-4 in left arm, 3-4 in legs. Muscle weakness in legs (legs shaking when walking down stairs for example) Jan 28 (Thurs):Symptoms started fading. Arm pain lowered in severity in both arms, as did leg pain. By Saturday all that remained was mild leg pain (1-2 in severity)Since then, leg pain has persisted.  Week of Feb 14, leg pain increased in severity back to a 3-4. Visited the doctor on the 17th and had blood-work done on the 23rd after severity didn&#39;t decrease. Blood-work was normal other than slightly elevated lymphocyte % (50.8%)Visited a specialty medicine doctor on 2/25 and had x-rays done of legs. Results normal. Thought to have developed Achilles tendinitis. Possibly attributed to inflammation in legs, doctor wasn&#39;t sure. Rough quote &#34;could it be from the vaccine, possibly, we just don&#39;t know.&#34; Have been doing stretches since which has helped the leg pain. Starting on March 12, I began to have pain in my left arm again, and ended up getting vertigo that evening. The arm pain persisted on and off from then on out, as well as occasional dizziness, which I treated with Dramamine. I did get an appointment scheduled with a neurologist in May that I still have. On March 25, I began to feel unwell, with a fever, dizziness, and a headache. That worsened into the evening, and I woke up at around 3 am with a high fever, that ended up going to about 103 F, and began vomiting around 4:30am on Friday, which persisted into the evening. On Saturday evening I began to feel better. With that recovery, the constant leg pain and frequent arm pain seemed to be gone, and has yet to return to the degree that it had been prior to that bout of sickness.  I do still occasionally get arm or leg pain, but it&#39;s minor and only lasts about 20-30 minutes at a time.

                                                Patient received vaccine in left arm (deltoid). Was in post vaccination observation area. About 5 minutes after the injection, while sitting in the observation chairs, the patient fainted and hit his head on the floor. Pharmacist and patient&#39;s father got him back up into the chair. Patient quickly regained consciousness, but felt nauseous and warm. Patient was given a little water. But could carry-on a conversation.  Patient vomited a little into a trash can. About 10 additional minutes went by. Patient was able to get up out of the chair and walk out of the facility with the help of his family. Patient had a little bit of bump on head where he had struck the floor, no bleeding occurred. No additional medical assistance was contacted at that time by the facility, family, or the pharmacist. Pharmacist called the patient several hours to after to see how he was doing, but did not get a response. The pharmacist left a voicemail. It is unknown to the pharmacist whether or not the family decided it was necessary to get medical follow-up or not after the incident.

Patient says that he was in his USOH until yesterday when he started having substernal chest pain which was getting worse with inspiration but also with specific movements. He does have pain even at rest sometimes but he thinks that it&#39;s exacerbating by breathing. Had some nausea/vomiting as well. Denies other symptoms. Not really sob or leg swelling.    In the ER, his Trop I was 10.7 and his WBC was 12.2. His EKG was NSR with short PR and STE I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6  Patient is a 21 y.o. male with no past medical history who got his second dose of COVID (Pfizer) vaccine on Saturday presented with chest pain since Sunday with some pleuritic characteristics. He was found to have a very elevated trop I to 10.7, leukocytosis to 12.2 and STE in I, II, III, AVF, V4-V6. His POCUS in the ER was without significant pericardial effusion and probably normal EF. Differential at this point includes pericarditis vs myopericarditis (there are some myocarditis cases reported in Israel post Pfizer vaccination, predominantly in young male patients) vs less likely ACS.

He has no past medical history or exertional symptoms to suggest CAD.  Bedside echocardiogram showed preserved left ventricular systolic function.  He was admitted and placed on aspirin and colchicine.  A cardiac MRI today showed evidence of myopericarditis.  He had 3 beats of nonsustained VT on tele.

                                                my son was on a strenuous bicycle trip and reached his campground for the night. in the late evening he called me to report that he was suffering from nausea and rapid heartbeat (tachycardia). we assumed this was caused by heat exhaustion, but later I saw news reports about myocarditis being investigated as a possible side effect from the Covid-19 vaccine. my son fits the rough profile (young man) and experienced these symptoms three days after his second vaccination, so I thought this should be reported. He completed his bike trip (200 miles) and feels fine after taking one day to rest.

He was noted to be tachycardic and hypotensive with a severe leukocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers and &#43; troponin, and an LVEF 35-40%. He was referred to tertiary care center, had a cardiac MRI that showed little inflammation but LVEF now 12%.  On 5/21/21 he was started on high dose steroids and placed on mechanical circulatory support with VA ECMO.  Cardiac function quickly improved and he is ready to come off VA ECMO 5/29 with an LVEF improved to &gt; 40% during weaning trials.

                                                Overnight after shot just typical symptoms, some slight chills and next day just a little tired Day 2 after shot, April 11th.  Chest pain, squeezing in chest. Unusual but manageable and didn?t feel terrible otherwise,maybe slightly tired.  Tried leaning forward to make feel better.  Day 3 and 4 chest pain/heart squeezing continued and was bothersome and, went to Urgent Care this day  April 13th. EKG was a little abnormal and told to follow up with a cardiologist and take Advil.  The heart squeezing feeling continued.  Early morning hours April 14th very sick, excessive shaking (no fever), extreme nausea, faint feeling, dry cough (laying on bathroom floor).  Not much, if any chest pain at the time.  Went to ER.  Not much chest pain during ER visit but nauseous and shaking etc. Test were run.   Told that the symptoms were a delayed reaction to the vaccine and to follow up with a cardiologist because possible abnormal EKG and to take Advil as needed.  Overnight at home, no chest pain but an hour of the shaking and nausea returned but not as bad as before.  Over next couple days the chest pain/squeezing, slightly shakes and  light headedness would come and go and by 4-16 feeling pretty great.  The heart feeling mildly at most in the background but not debilitating.  Starting week of April 20th maybe 4-5 flare ups with chest pain and no pattern but not debilitating.  Could happen at rest.  April 27th bigger flare up more debilitating, had to lie down, heart squeezing  pain and maybe some wheezing when breathed in but not tightness in throat.  Lasted about 30 minutes.  Was just doing schoolwork with friends at the time so not under any physical or emotional stress at the time.  After this from April 20 to May 3rd feeling heart symptom mildly but not debilitating and could resume normal active life.  Had cardiology appt. May 3rd with nurse practitioner.  According to NP the 12 Lead EKG run that day correlated with abnormal EKG from ER.  Normal sinus rhythm with sinus arrhythmia Rightward axis Pulmonary disease pattern.  Incomplete right bundle branch block Abnormal ECG.  Given 4 lead heart monitor to wear for a week.  Also ordered a CV CT angiogram coronaries with calcium scoring.  The test could not be scheduled through them until July.  Also told could go on hiking trip out west and to stop and rest if felt pain.  For parents reassurance about hiking trip, had a second opinion over teleconference call with Dr., myocarditis specialist to confirm would be safe on hiking trip. Dr. said he should be good to go.  He said these heart symptoms related to the second vaccine could fade over time.  Hiking trip May 20th to May 30th.  Did fine with exertion and just a few small episodes of the chest pain, light headedness and maybe a little shaking but these were at rest.  Also, 4 lead heart monitor report was good.  Returned from trip May 30th and no chest pain or symptoms for approximately 3 weeks through June 17th.   June 18th went to urgent care for sore throat and ear.  Prescribed amoxycillin.  Took the amoxycillin and one Advil sinus, that evening had a heart squeezing episode return.  This was the first time in almost 3 weeks.  Did not take any more Advil sinus in case that caused the episode. Had another slight episode that evening.  Hiked next day June 19th and fine.  Then felt it slightly again after eating that afternoon of the 19th, also chest did feel a little tight all day.  Then felt it again that evening.  Still taking Amoxycillin as of today.

I have no stamina at all, just slight exertion causes my heart to start racing and pounding, I can&#39;t climb stairs and I haven&#39;t been able to work in weeks, now I&#39;m probably going to lose my job I fear and then will have no health insurance. I have more tests this week to try and find out if I have endocarditis, so I am racking up all kinds of bills. So far no one believes me or will help me! ALL of this started within a few days of the second Pfizer dose of COVID vaccine. Biggest mistake of my life. I feel like I&#39;m dying and no one will help. You are literally killing me.

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

                                                I have had severe diarrhea the past 4 days. Starting Friday morning around 2am, by the time it was 6 am, I have already gone 6 times. I have gone 25 times from Friday am-sat night. It calmed on Sunday and picked up Monday and this morning. I have been following the BRAT diet and have been drinking fluids. It doesn?t make sense why I?m still feeling this way. I also had a fever for three days,  throwing up Friday/Saturday, and have had headaches since Friday.

                                                Felt fine day of vaccine, Sunday, just minor arm pain. Woke up the next morning with pretty severe fatigue and more arm pain. Around 11am I had pretty bad chills that lasted about an hour, along with minor nausea. Additionally,  throughout most of the day my heart rate was usually between 90-100 bpm, even while lying down and doing nothing.  Going to sleep on Monday night I woke around 3 times during the night with cold sweats. Waking up on Tuesday morning, my heart rate is still elevated, arm is still sore, but the fatigue isn&#39;t as bad. However, at around 9am on Tuesday morning I started to develop itchy hives and a rash on the back of my legs.  After the first dose I only had a sore arm, no symptoms like these, and I do not have any known allergies.

He was evaluated by EMTs onsite and found to be significantly bradycardic and hypotensive. He was transported to ER for evaluation. Pt was anxious about the vaccine and reported not eating prior to receiving it.

                                                Pt reported reaction with #1 dose of mild SOB and itchy throat. Given PO Benadryl and brought to ED for his SOB, though no additional treatments administered. Both ED Physician and PCP advised pt should still receive #2 dose. Pt presented prior to dose with normal mentation, and no difficulty ambulating or verbalizing beyond baseline. Pt had no issues when receiving vaccine then called over staff 2-3 minutes after vaccination to report SOB. EMS notified and staff. EMT and staff. EMR came to assist patient. Clinical Lead notified of 1st dose reaction and current reaction after SOB onset began and EMS brought over. Pt provided PO Benadryl 5 minutes after vaccine administered and able to swallow with no issue. I, Clinical Lead, remained at patient side where patient was able to describe his pain but had dyspnea and only able to get out 2-3 words at a time. After a few minutes, pt SOB worsened to the point he was unable to speak but no color changes noted. Mentation declined with pt somnolence present. At this point, Clinical Lead called 911 for backup as Benadryl had no relief of symptoms and SOB worsened along with mentation. Also noted that EMS pulse ox was not working so unable to provide accurate O2 saturation to delineate whether reaction was anxiety or allergic. Pt also noted history of seizure disorder though declined feeling was a current seizure and denied history of respiratory or cardiac conditions. Paramedics felt pt needed transport to the hospital and report provided by Clinical lead.

Symptoms are made worse by deep inspiration.  Were improved following self administration of 600 mg of ibuprofen earlier today.  2 days ago he received his second COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer).  Following day he experienced arm pain muscular aches and pains severe discomfort of the right arm (injection site) later in the day there was nausea and vomiting on one occasion (nonheme).  By last night he was able to eat dinner but subsequently felt short of breath with worsening chest discomfort morning the left arm continued to ache with musculoskeletal pains.  Developed more discomfort in the left anterior chest radiating to the throat made worse by deep inspiration. Does not describe typical sharp catching pain of pericarditis.  No cough sputum bruising bleeding abdominal pain change in color or character of bowels.  Sign in the emergency room he was hemodynamically stable, in sinus rhythm with a normal EKG.Torrey work-up notable for an initial troponin of 1.28 and a follow-up troponin of 2.14. Chest x-ray perfectly normal. Elevated d-dimer. CT angiography negative for pulmonary embolism vascular injury, cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion but the radiologist did note thickening of several right posterior and lateral axillary lymph nodes raising a question of recent right-sided vaccination or injury/infection to the right arm. Presently he is perfectly comfortable able to take a deep inspiration with mild chest discomfort, breathing easily.  I met him in July 2018He came to the emergency room with a 3-day viral syndrome manifested as headache nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal discomfort and then developed chest discomfort.  He was found with diffuse mild J-point elevation on EKG consistent with a viral type pericarditis with troponins which rose to a maximum of 10.4.  Work-up for myocarditis was negative.  Echocardiogram perfectly normal.  Symptoms responded to a course of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and colchicine.  Seen in follow-up of repeat echocardiogram was perfectly healthy.  Our diagnosis was myopericarditis. There is no history of shortness of breath dyspnea on exertion decrement of exercise capacity peripheral edema orthopnea PND palpitations lightheadedness syncope or collapse.  No ill contacts.  He works in a high security position and therefore qualified for early administration of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  Graph past medical history notable only for the episode of myopericarditis and a remote tonsillectomy. There is no significant family history of sudden cardiac death or unusual heart disease. He takes no medications. Patient was recommended to take 4 weeks of ibuprofen and colchicine if needed for worsening chest pain.  Patient was recommended to follow-up closely with his primary care doctor and check ESR, C-reactive protein as well as renal function.  Needs close follow-up with cardiology as an outpatient.

No radiation.  Denies lifting any heavy weight or any heavy exercise.  Never had similar symptoms in the past.  He had his second dose Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on May 12.  He denies leg pain or swelling.  His vomiting and fever resolved.   ED: He was found to have troponin of more than 12,000, EKG showed diffuse ST segment elevation with possible repolarization.   Transferred for possible cardiac cath/cardiac MRI.  CT angio chest no PE, normal aorta, no infiltration.  Pending second set of troponin, stat echo, aspirin po  given in the ER.   In addition to the above HPI, he reports having 2 days of fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  T-max 103F.  His chest pain began around 4 PM yesterday and he felt like it was initially consistent with his asthma, however it did not improve so around 1:30 AM he states they went to the ER.  He states that the chest pain gets better with exertion, and is worse with deep breaths and lying on his side, or leaning forward. He did take Nyquil decongestant which contains phenylephrine.     Hospital Course   22 yo M w/PMH exercise induced asthma admitted for evaluation of CP, elevated troponin to 21,292 with negative LHC. UDS Negative. EKG w/diffuse ST changes so consistent with Myopericarditis I31.9 given Recent Viral Illness resulting in first time myopericarditis, will treat per pericarditis algorithm, ASA&#43;Colchicine w/90% response rate by 1 week.     -ASA 650 to 1000 mg TID, weekly tapers if CRP normalized and sx free; will start at 650 mg dose   -Colchicine 0.6 mg BID for 3 months, no taper (lowers recurrence rate, NNT = 5)   -Glucocorticoid generally not indicated in first-time acute myopericarditis as observational studies suggest increased recurrence rate, but can consider if he does not adequately respond to aspirin and colchicine   -Trend troponin to ensure downtrend continues   -No strenuous exercise during recovery period

                                                On Friday night, April 16,2021, after working all day for his job, Pt told his roomates that he wasn&#39;t feeling well, was throwing up, had the chills and was going to lay down. When the roomates didn&#39;t see him Monday morning, April 19, 2021, they went into his room and found him unresponsive. The medical examiner ruled death due to cancer which appears incorrect considering the evidence.

                                                The side effects didn&#39;t all occur simultaneously. Friday evening I noticed severe arm soreness. Later Friday night (about 10 hours after getting the vaccine) I developed gradual onset chills, body aches, and fatigue. Saturday I woke up with a severe headache, body aches, fatigue, and fever. The headache became severe by mid-day, with fatigue also worsening throughout the day.  Sunday was more of the same, though I believe the fever started inching down and the headache lessened. What developed Sunday afternoon/evening took me off guard though. I noticed a sudden drop in heart rate, a feeling of pressure and discomfort in the chest, nausea, and shortness of breath with exertion (consistently - not just once). (I&#39;m a long-distance runner, so this is unusual for me.) At first I debated going to the emergency room, but since I&#39;m so young and in otherwise good condition I thought nothing of it. I had similar symptoms the following day, but I avoided exerting myself until all of my symptoms from the vaccine had ended. I felt groggy and fatigued for several additional days, but by Saturday (8 days after getting the first dose of Pfizer) everything had resolved. I also developed swollen lymph nodes, which returned to normal size within about 3 weeks (before swelling again after the second vaccine).  The second dose of the vaccine caused a more sudden and intense reaction, though I never developed chest pain/slow heart rate with it.  Instead I developed sudden onset severe chills, fatigue, and body aches about 9 hours after getting the shot. A fast heart rate, shortness of breath, and sudden onset fever (temperature jumped nearly five degrees in about 90 minutes) quickly followed. My fever stabilized around 102.2 around 3 a.m. that morning, and slowly crept down throughout the afternoon/evening. Overall, with dizziness, body aches, extreme fatigue, etc., this was the sickest I&#39;ve been since I had a severe case of the Flu in high school. The fatigue, shortness of breath, and fast heart rate continued for about a week - getting slightly better each day.

A 22-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/Lot Number: unknown; Expiration Date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 28Jan2021 (22-year-old at the time of vaccination), as a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included non-sustained ventricular tachycardia diagnosed at birth, pacemaker and defibrillator. The reporter stated that her son has a serious heart condition, pacemaker/defibrillator- first was in 6th grade, currently on his fourth and drug hypersensitivity states they monitored them both longer than the 15 minutes because they have a history of serious allergic reactions to ACE inhibitors. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient continues taking his low dose aspirin prior to the vaccine but did not take any Tylenol. On 28Jan2021, the patient experienced dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite, chills, body aches, fatigue, and itching. The outcome of all the events was recovered on 29Jan2021.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.  Follow-up attempts are completed. No further information is expected.

                                                Approximately two weeks after receiving the second dose I began to notice abdominal pain that worsened when breathing or laying down. The pain became more severe over the course of the next few days that I admitted myself to the emergency room of the  Hospital. A CT scan showed a pulmonary embolism located in my lower right-hand lung, which would have killed me if left untreated. I was admitted to the hospital and treated for pain and given intravenous blood thinners for 3-4 days. I was discharged with orders to follow up with a pulmonologist, cardiologist, and PCP. I was unable to schedule visits with the specialists due to financial constraints. After leaving the hospital my condition began to improve and has continued to improve since. As I understand it, the tissue in my lung may never heal and as a result i suffer diminished lung capacity.

                                                After giving the patient his Covid Vaccine, he tensed up and said he was feeling like he may vomit. He then became very pale and fainted while in the vaccination chair. After a few seconds he regained consciousness. We then helped him to the floor and elevated his legs and placed a cold pack on his neck. He started feeling better instantly but we kept him there for about 5 minutes. We then had him move to a chair and the technician sat with him for an additional 40 minutes. He then said he was fine and that he has fainted before (which was not disclosed) and left.

Later that night, I started experiencing some of the typical COVID vaccine side effects: sore arm, chills, nausea, and fever-like symptoms; in addition to the symptoms I was warned was possible, I also experienced periods of dizziness and an uncomfortable sense of balance. Three days later, the dizziness and other common symptoms have gone away, but my sense of balance still feels off, although I do not know if related to the vaccine. It?s not so bad that I?m at risk of falling over, but I have a semi-regular feeling of unsteadiness which I cannot explain.

                                                As the night went on I started to feel more and more fatigued at work(more than would be normal). I left early and felt a little nauseated by the time I got home. I went to sleep within 2 hours(around 12am). I woke up about 5 hours later with extreme fever symptoms(chills, nausea, fatigue, soreness) and a very intense headache. I contracted Covid-19 in October 2020 and this was much like how I felt when I was sick with the virus, minus the cough. Everything was mostly cleared up by the evening however.

A 23-year-old male patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Left arm on 27Mar2021 (between 11:55AM and 12:00PM) (Lot Number: ER8732; Expiration Date: Jul2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 via Intramuscular, at the age of 23-year-old, administered in right arm on 06Mar2021 (Lot Number: EN6206, Expiry: 30Jun2021) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. He felt really terrible yesterday (07Apr2021). On Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well, and he could barely sleep last night (07Apr2021). His head felt heavy on Tuesday night (06Apr2021), and his head felt super heavy last night (07Apr2021). On 07Apr2021, the patient experienced fatigue, on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow/throat pain, really bad headache, sensation of pressure in ear, sensation of pressure in eye, dizzy on standing, a little bit of nausea with the dizziness, really weak, he didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite, chills/teeth chattering, shaking, hot feeling generalized, sweating, feeling hot and cold. The patient experienced not feeling well on an unspecified date. Patient started developing symptoms that were very bad, he thought he had COVID. Patient had a PCR test that was negative. Patient would like to know if a delayed response after second dose is normal. Reported he had received his second COVID-19 Vaccine dose about 2 weeks ago (27Mar2021). He said he felt really terrible yesterday. He said he felt so bad that he thought he had the COVID-19 Virus, and went to get tested. He clarified he had a real time COVID-19 Virus PCR test yesterday (07Apr2021), and received a negative result today (08Apr2021), less than 24 hours after having the test performed. He said it could be something else that was making him feel terrible. He said he had a (telehealth) appointment with a doctor tomorrow (09Apr2021). Caller asked if Pfizer had any data with the second COVID-19 Vaccine for people that had a really delayed immune response with their immune system. He said he had no symptoms after his second COVID-19 Vaccine, and was wondering if what he was experiencing now was a delayed immune response. Reported last night was the worst for his symptoms, saying it was awful. He said he felt better this morning. He clarified that on Tuesday night (06Apr2021) he didn&#39;t sleep well. He said his head felt heavy, but when he woke up, he did not feel too bad. He said he had fatigue, and on the left side of his throat, it hurt to swallow. He said last night (07Apr2021), he had a really bad headache, and his head felt super heavy. He said he had ear and eye pressure. He said he got dizzy on standing, and at one point, had a little bit of nausea with the dizziness. He said he wasn&#39;t sure if the nausea was caused by the dizziness. He said he was really weak, and didn&#39;t eat yesterday because he had no appetite. He said he took his temperature at around 8:00PM-9:00PM last night, and had no fever. He said he still had his sense of taste and smell. He said he had chills, he was shaking, and his teeth were chattering. He said he was also hot and sweating at times, like he was alternating between hot and cold. He said he tried to drink water yesterday, and would take a few sips of water when he turned over in bed. He said he could barely sleep. Treatment: Reported he took Ibuprofen 200mg tablets, off and on, to treat his headache because his headache was preventing him from sleeping. He said he would take 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets at a time. He said he took his first Ibuprofen dose in the middle of the night on Tuesday, and then took 2 more doses of 2 Ibuprofen 200mg tablets last night. He said he did not have the Ibuprofen 200mg tablet NDC, Lot, and Expiration Date because he had taken Ibuprofen from a different Ibuprofen 200mg bottle and put it in the Ibuprofen 200mg he was taking from. Reported he felt he had gained strength back today (08Apr2021) because he had showered this morning, and didn&#39;t fall over. He said he was so weak yesterday, even trying to text for his work was bad. He said his headache was a little worse today, and his left-sided throat pain was persisting, but everything else had subsided for now. Caller said he was wondering if what he had experienced was a delayed immune response, or a false negative COVID-19 Virus test, or something else, like Mono. Patient was not feeling well. Did test negative covid. The outcome of the event headache, Swallowing painful and Throat pain was not recovered, other events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

I drank coke soda instead and slept until 4pm and I took another 200mg ibuprofen pill with water, after which I felt better.

I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

Compelled by an act of stupidity to eat a muffin at 10:30pm went to bed around midnight. Woke up around 1am feeling queasy and began projectile vomiting. Evacuated all of that and then had a dry heave and it was over. In all only lasted about 6-7 minutes. I got the sheet I was handed when I was given my vaccine and saw this website. I looked at the chart and saw this did occur with the second dose and  saw that this was relatively common in getting the second shot of the vaccine and just wanted to report it since I?m not about to go to sleep. Checked my temperature and it is around 96 and was around 98 when I was going to bed at around 11pm

                                                Normal reaction the following day, strong fatigue, headache, nausea, arm soreness. Disappeared 36 hours later. 3 days later experienced heavy nausea, anxiety, gastrointestinal discomfort. Heavy bloating, inability to pass gas, loose stool/diarrhea all week. 7 days post vaccination symptoms came back, feeling of wanting to vomit, strong nausea, loss of appetite. 7-14 days later lost majority of appetite, eating aversion, heavy bloating, nausea and continuing diarrhea. Weakness, fatigue and shaking. Received Stool sample and blood test April 13. Elevated levels of albumin and red blood cell count. Doctor said it was most likely from dehydration. Zofran prescribed April 13 and only taken 2 days. Nausea subsided and ability to eat came back slowly. Since April 15th have been eating more food, but still have to force myself to eat. Hunger pangs rarely felt, only know when hungry when stomach churns and fatigue sets in. Today, April 28, still experiencing slight anxiety, loose stools once every other day, brain fog and depression. Lack of emotion, irritability and  periodic upset stomach still persist, along with appetite loss. Am able to eat filling meals again, but no appetite makes food less appealing. Failure to thrive still evident and feeling like I won&#39;t get better evident. Treatment during illness was minimal, urgent care did nothing other than prescribe zofran. Gastroenterologist and GP cannot see me for another 2 weeks.

Had to stay awake from 3am-5am because on the verge of vomiting, but never did.  Kept sipping water and took 2 ibuprofen. The symptoms dulled slightly after 5am but had a 100 degree fever all day, along with full body muscle soreness and couldn&#39;t leave the couch more than a few times because of moderate nausea, headache, and soreness.

                                                Patient stated he felt nauseated and dizzy. When he attempted to stand up to move to the cot, he was unable to steady himself and he said he felt shaky, so RN, brought cot to him, and a few Admin staff surrounded him with drapes dividers. He laid on the cot to rest, legs elevated, and he stayed approx 30minutes. He said he was cold and he just felt &#34;off.&#34; Today&#39;s dose was his second, and he said he had no reaction to the first dose. He said he ate today. He drank an 8oz bottle of water. Cool pack applied to back of his neck. He said he felt nausous,and was unable to sit up after several minutes of laying down on the cot. After some deep breathing exercises, and resting, he began to feel a little better. RN brought his wife into the area from the car where she was waiting. Eventually, he said he was feeling steady enough to sit in a chair. RN&#39;s, B and D helped him out of cot and into a folding chair. After a few minutes, he said he still felt &#34;not like himself&#34; and the decision was made to go to the urgent care. RN D and worker assisted patient to the passenger side of the car. 1500: 124/90 P99  T98.3 R16  1515: 120/70 P67 T98.3 POx99% 1530: 120/78 P80 POx 99% R1

                                                24-year-old male with no prior medical problems presents for evaluation of chest pain.  Patient complains of midsternal chest pain that started approximately an hour ago.  He states that it woke him up from sleep.  Pain is sharp without any radiation or other associated symptoms including diaphoresis presyncopal symptoms or palpitations.  He denies any significant air hunger or shortness of breath.  He otherwise had been feeling better after what he tall was post COVID vaccine symptoms.  Patient received a 2nd dose of pfizer vaccine 3 days ago.  He states that within 24 hours he had symptoms of myalgia fever and feeling unwell.  That has been resolving patient has been feeling better until the chest pain today. Patient otherwise denies any other medical problems in.  He denies any history of drug use including any recent cocaine or other drug abuse.   Elevated cardiac enzymes and chest discomfort are likely secondary to myocarditis and secondary to vaccination/ inflammatory reaction.  Although there is low likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease as well.  I recommended cardiac catheterization for clarification.  He does not want to have the procedure done, understands the risk of undiagnosed coronary artery disease and risk of MI.  He would like to be discharged home.    I reviewed the images of echocardiogram and it seems that he has a small area of hypokinesis in infero basal segment.   Recommended to take aspirin and be seen in Cardiology office in 2 weeks.  Advised to abstain from exercise and significant physical activity till that time and return to the hospital if any symptoms.       Subjective:   I saw patient in consultation for evaluation of chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes.   Patient is a 24-year-old healthy male who had COVID-19 vaccination with his second Pfizer shot 4/14/21. He developed fever, chills, nausea and vomiting 1 day after vaccination.  He did not have any reaction to the 1st dose.   He presented to the hospital with substernal chest discomfort which woke him up from sleep, radiated to throat and had a throbbing feeling.  This lasted for 1 to 2 hours and subsided completely in the hospital.   He smokes 5 cigarettes a day, is physically very active and exercises regularly.  He is not on any medication at home.

                                                MYOCARDITIS.  I experienced extreme chest pain, tightness, shortness of breath, painful heart beats, I could feel each beat. I hunched over in my bed groom grabbing my abdomen and fell onto my bed and almost passed out from whack I?d assume is lack of oxygen. I could barely breathe for about five minutes and felt relatively severe pain particularly in the right side of my chest. I could feel every muscle, tendon, and artery inflamed, enlarged, and hurting. My chest felt like it filled up with a balloon. Heart rate went up too. I have NEVER EVER felt ANYTHING like this in my LIFE. Not even close. It was a brand new sensation to me first time I?ve ever felt anything like this at all, and very intense and frustrating. Keeping in mind I am in perfect health. I am a body builder with a perfect physique. I work at a high end restaurant and have an extremely good diet. I have a normal sleep and sexual routine, I don?t use any medications whatsoever even Tylenol or ibuprofen. I have no pre existing conditions. I have no history of heart or cardio problems. My family has a history of low blood pressure. I have next to no stress or anxiety in my life. I am 24 years old I work out and run miles, five to six days a week. I don?t use nicotine, tobacco, and I haven?t had a drink of alcohol in ten years (14yrs old). I smoke marijuana on a daily basis. After about ten minutes the incident went down and I was able to breathe a little better but still had pain and tightness in my chest. I have had shortness of breath ever since. This is being written the day after the event about 26 hours later. I ran a mile last night and went to the gym it seemed to help both my breathing and the pain and tightness but it has not fully gone away. I feel my heart straining somehow as I am typing this. One thing to note is I did not want to get vaccinated but was pressured to do so, and before getting it I was very nervous and honestly upset. The woman administering it was not helpful at all and actually mocked my unsureness and was very rude and unprofessional. She didn?t answer any technical questions I had. During my interaction with her between my nerves and her behavior I?m absolutely certain my heart rate was elevated at the time of getting the shot. I have only had one shot. The episode of  myocarditis occurred two weeks after my first shot. Two days after my scheduled second shot, which I missed because of work and was going to reschedule before this occurred. I am not going to be getting the second shot. Will be following up with my primary care doctor as soon as possible. Haven?t had time.

                                                The client experienced mild nausea and anxiety 5 minutes after receiving his first Pfizer covid vaccine. He left observation after 15 minutes at 1345 with no treatment, except bottled water. An hour later at 1445 the client returned to Observation c/o increasing nausea and vomiting. At this time, I administered 50 mg IM benadryl to the client. The client waited in observation for 30 additional minutes and left at 1515. At this time of departure, the client had no signs or symptoms of N/V.

The patient experienced 104 degree fever with vomiting, dizziness and extreme muscle joint pain. We explained to him that we noticed the dose he was given had been diluted improperly and he had received a slightly higher than normal dose.   I apologized for the incident and he said ?it?s ok?, and that now he knew why he was so sick.  He was very pleasant and appreciative of us trying to contact him over the weekend.   He was encouraged to contact us with any questions or if any new symptoms arise.   We also offered to have one of our providers contact him to discuss further, but he declined.

He reports that he doesn&#39;t do well with vaccinations. He believes that he started feeling this way before the vaccine was even completely administered. He looked pale. We had him sit on the ground and he ended up drinking water and resting for well over 30 minutes so we could observe him. At no point did he have trouble breathing or swallowing. We had him stand up for several minutes to make sure not dizzy before he left. He refused a ride home, ambulance and said did not need to get ride home. Said he felt completely back to normal before leaving.

                                                Pt is a 25M with PMH of GERD, ADHD, obesity who presented to the ED on 5/11 for chest pain. That morning he had noticed increased substernal chest pressure associated with palpitations, nausea, diaphoresis, and left arm tingling. He notes that early last year he was very sick and though he had COVID but confirmatory testing was not available at that time. After recovering from the illness he noted that he had occasionally episodes of chest pressure and palpitations. However yesterday was the worst his symptoms have ever been. He did receive his 2nd COVID vaccine this past Saturday and experienced fatigue, nausea, weakness.  In the ED patient has HD stable, afebrile, saturating well on RA. Labs were notable for troponin of 5.2 which trend down to 3.1. ESR WNL, CRP elevated 2.4. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with signs suggestive of possible pericarditis. CXR negative. CTA showed no pulmonary embolism, enlarged and prominent left axillary lymph nodes, nonspecific, cholelithiasis. Patient admitted for NSTEMI. Enlarged axillary lymph nodes likely reactive in the setting of recent COVID vaccine.    Cardiology consulted. Patient underwent cardiac cath which was unremarkable. Cardiology recommends short course NSAIDs for possible pericarditis, however EKG changes unimpressive per cardiology. Discharged home on ibuprofen 400 mg TID for 5 days. Advise follow up with PCP within 1 week.

After about a week, COVID fog/fatigue symptoms began.  It is currently 6 weeks later and I have fatigue, shortness of breath, head pressure, double vision, cannot concentrate for any length of time and dizziness/unsteadiness.  I have not been able to go to work since the vaccination and have people helping take care of me.  I cannot take a shower without being short of breath after.  I have been put on 2 different rounds of steroids ? the 2nd more aggressive, which did not make a difference.  I have been to my general doctor several times, an allergist and a neurologist.  I have had extensive bloodwork, an MRI, and an EKG ? all were normal.  My symptoms have not improved at all in the past 3-4 weeks.

The ambulance was called and I was checked in place. ever since I got the vaccine I started feeling my heart rhythm changed, either my heart is slowing down or it beats really fast or get a discomfort  feeling in heart and get the feeling  of passing out again. This made me loose my appetite to eat for several days. On two instances, i went to the emergency room. I&#39;ve been following up with my doctor about this issue.  The discomfort will happen every several days. Before getting the vaccine I had none of the symptoms.

Went to see Dr who performed lab work and stool tests that all came back negative (4/19). Was treated with Zithromax but had no resolution to his symptoms.  No family history or prior history of IBD. It seems the onset of disease is clearly temporaly related to the timing of his Pfizer vaccine.
