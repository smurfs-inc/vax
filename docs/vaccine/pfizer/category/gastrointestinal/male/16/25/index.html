                                                Patient received vaccine around 745 am on 4/22/21.  He did not have any side effects or concerns until 4/23/21 at approximately 9:30 am when he had what Mom describes as a grand mal seizure while at school.  Patient was reportedly sitting in his chair at school.  He stretched his arms above his head then fell onto the floor with full body convulsions for just under 1 minute.  Patient vomited about 20 minutes later.  Our office was informed by mother around 10:30 am.  Patient at home and sleeping.  Advised Mom to take patient to local ED for further evaluation and monitoring.

                                                Pt was seated in the waiting area after receiving his first dose of covid 19. His parents who also received the vaccine were waiting with him. I was preparing another dose for patients waiting for their covid vaccination. I heard pounding on the clinic room and ran to check. The mom had knocked on the door because her son had fallen out of his chair.. when I arrived he was on the floor and his parents said he was regaining consciousness and moved him in to a seated position. At this point another customer was calling 911. I had my technician call management.  I observed the patient and asked if he was doing ok. His parents asked him if he was hurt and he responded in the negative. The patient was feeling cold and his hands were &#34;cold and clamy&#34; according to his mom so I held off on the cold compress. He wanted water but was also nauseous so I told the parents that I do not want to risk aspiration. We gave him a bag to throw up. I recommended that they take him to get seen when the paramedics arrived as I was concerned about him shaking before fainting. At this point the paramedics arrived and he was taken to the hospital as he was not feeling well. I followed up with the patient&#39;s mom and she said all his tests came back normal (EKG, et) and that the doctors may think it could have been due to anxiety from getting the vaccine. She was really appreciative of the call.

Patient started to sway and lost muscle control.  I helped to the floor and laid him out.  Patient conscious whole time and never stopped breathing.  Did not lose cognizance.  Had momentary feeling of nausea that immediately passed.  Did not believe necessary to call 9-1-1 as patient did not exhibit any allergy symptoms of any distress during the whole episode.  Allowed to lay on floor for about 5-10 min.  Supplied patient with bottle of water to help with dry mouth and he drank and felt better.  After another 10 minutes patient was up on feet and feltmuch better.  Mother called an hour and a half later (about 5 min ago as I prepare this form) to inform me that he was back to 100%.

                                                Patient is a previously healthy 16 year-old M presenting with acute onset chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, malaise, fever and myalgia to ED on 5/6/2021 at 20:44.  He started experiencing symptoms on 5/6/2021 morning a t06:07 AM.  He received his second dose of  Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on 5/4/2021 10:: AM.  In the ED, CBC, CMP and UA was within normal limits. EKG at 20:46  and again at 21:14 showed  ST segment elevation in inferolateral leads with possible myocardial injury, ischemia or pericarditis.  Troponin 0 hour was 835 and at 2 hours 1674.  Patient was admitted to the PICU for further evaluation and management. Echo on 5/6/2021 showed normal LV systolic function with SF 31%  . Cardiac MRI on 5/7 showed contrast enhancement of inferolateral wall consistent with myo-pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.  Troponins were trended every 12 hours and plateaued in the 1800&#39;s on 5/8/2021. Patient was diagnosed with acute myo-pericarditis. Respiratory viral PCR and COVID-19 PCR on 05/06/2021 were negative. Thyroid studies were normal. ANA titer is pending. Viral serology for HbsAg was negative and HIV was non-reactive. Results for additional viral serologies for Coxsackie viruses, EBV, CMV and HHV6 are awaited. Patient was treated with  NSAIDs and Colchicine. IVIG was not given based on clinical judgement. Pediatric Cardiology was involved in patient&#39;s care and clinical decision making. Patient remained hemodynamically stable on room air throughout his PICU course. He was discharged on 5/9/2021 with Pediatric Cardiology outpatient follow up in 2-3 weeks. He will continue Ibuprofen 600 mg every hours and Famotidine 20 mg 2 times daily until his follow up.

                                                Child woke up at 3 am with severe nausea. Within minutes he complained about not being able to breathe. His lips turned blue and he was about to pass out. As I was able to keep him awake, I am not sure whether he would have had a febrile seizure (it very much looked like it) or just fainted. The fever spike was too fast, and his body couldn&#39;t handle it. His extreme nausea persisted for four hours (but he didn&#39;t vomit). He was completely debilitated. Fever spiked to 103 but stabilized at 102 for the following 24 hrs.

On Thursday 4/29/2021, he developed &#34;heartburn&#34;, and on Friday 4/30/2021 he developed chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. He presented to Hospital on  late 4/30/2021 or early 5/1/2021 for evaluation; initial labs showed a CRP of 1.23, POC troponin of 6.56 ng/mL (03:18 on 5/1) and lab level of 17.6 ng/mL  (03:05 on 5/1) that increased to 24 ng/mL later in the morning on 5/1. COVID-19 PCR was negative. He was transferred to another Hospital mid-day on 5/1/2021 due to concerns for myocarditis/myopericarditis. He was started on NSAIDs. His troponin level improved, had decreased to 9.69 ng/mL on 5/2/2021; at that point as his chest pain had improved and labs were improving, parents requested that he be discharged from the hospital. He had 2 echocardiograms at PCH which reportedly showed normal biventricular systolic function. He had an echo at the hospital on 5/2/2021 which showed normal biventricular systolic function, no pericardial effusion, and normal valves.   As an outpatient, he had repeat troponin-I levels: 2.49 ng/mL on 5/3; 0.31 ng/mL on 5/5; the troponin level was reportedly normal on 5/10/2021 per his primary cardiologist

                                                Patient was given first dose and was in waiting area for observation.  About ten minutes after his shot our vaccine coordinator alerted me that he was having a reaction. When I went out to the patient his eyes were open but he was staring blankly. His father was shaking him and waving his hand in front of his face and asking him if he was okay and the patient was not responding. I also tried to get the patient to respond and he did not. Since the patient was not responsive to any questions we called 911. While waiting on the paramedics to arrive the patient came around and started to answer some simple questions. He was clammy and sweating and he threw up one time. When the paramedics arrived they took over. They checked all the patients vital signs  and were with him for about 15 or 20 minutes assessing him. The patient walked out of the store on his own and was not taken by ambulance.   I called the patient around 3:10pm to check on him and I spoke with him and he said he was doing fine.

Patient was sitting in the living room around 2030-2045 when he developed midsternal and epigastric region pain. Pain radiated to his upper middle back and down both left and right arms. There were no notable exacerbating or relieving factors. Pain was a 4-7 in severity. He was also nauseated. He was given tums by his mother without significant change in symptoms. After 45 minutes they decided to go to the ER. At ER labs were notable for elevated troponin (2-- &gt;15-- &gt;9). EKG with J-point elevation. Non-contrast CT chest/abd/pelvis was unremarkable. He was given ASA 325 and famotidine in the ED. Pain eventually subsided around 2345. He was transferred to another hospital for further evaluation of troponinemia.

Fever did not go away without medication. Medication would alleviate it but it continued for 6 days, reaching 102.4.  Pediatrician tested for strep and for COVID, both were negative.  Sore throat persisted after fevers subsided.  Had to finally be prescribed magic mouthwash. Doctor said sores on lips were herpes so prescribed viral medications.  My son never has a sore throat and has never had a herpes sore until after the shot.

                                                A few minutes after patient received dose this morning around 9:20am, he became pale, developed hot flashes, shaking, nausea, dizziness, and hands feeling numb/tingling. Provided the patient with a cold pack for the back of his neck and water to drink, and encouraged him to sit with his head lowered. The patient&#39;s father pointed out that he had not had anything to eat that morning, which could have contributed to his response. After a few minutes, most of the symptoms abated, and patient was feeling much better. His father left the store with him at that time. Called the father later that day, and he said patient was feeling better. Had taken nap and was only feeling a little tired. I explained possible side effects from vaccine and father thanked me for our time and concern.

                                                Started Saturday, April 17 around 9am with nausea, abdominal pain and vomiting bile (this started 23-24 hours after the vaccine; no other side effects).  The focus of the pain was on the lower right side of his abdomen, and when he tried to stand up straight the pain increased in intensity and he felt like it was &#34;pulling&#34;.  With all the vomiting the pain spread to most of the abdomen, but after getting Zofran and resting that additional area subsided.  He was evaluated at Medical Center and ultimately transferred to hospital for appendectomy on April 17 around 5pm.  Appendectomy was done early morning Sunday, April 17 and he was discharged home that afternoon

                                                came to see me 3 days after his first Pfizer Covid vaccine and had been having a subjective fever, bad headache and stomach ache since the day the vaccine was administered. He incidentally had some weight loss noted at the visit over the previous 6 months for which I did some lab work. The lab work was normal except for his platelet count which was 111,000. A repeat platelet count done a week later was normal at 273,000. Because of the transient decrease in platelet count and the 3 days of bad headache after the vaccine, I decided to hold off on  getting a second Covid vaccine. Additionally and possibly of no significance, his mother apparently had a history of ITP during her childhood.

Patient received his second dose and with in 48 hours was hospitalized for appendicitis.   If it was a reaction after just one shot, I would normally think it was a coincidence. With him have severe reactions after both shots, it seems very suspicious!

                                                17-year old M with history of recurrent ear infections requiring PE tube placement who was in his usual state of health until 5/5 when he noticed a new itchy hive-like rash. He was short of breath 5/6, and developed fevers that night along with vomiting. He was seen 5/6 with negative COVID19 PCR and documented fever to 104. Fevers continued, and he was admitted the evening of 5/10 with concern for myocarditis. See below for hospital course. Additional information for Item 18: ...Screening labs were notable for mild lymphopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, hepatitis, and elevated inflammatory markers.  Given prior COVID infection, rash, and systemic inflammation, additional studies including troponin, D-dimer, BNP, and EKG were obtained.  EKG was reassuringly normal, however the D-dimer (2.48), troponin (1.27), and BNP (469) were elevated.  Other work-up included chest x-ray which was unremarkable, and right upper quadrant ultrasound with incidental cavernous hemangioma of the liver.  He was started on milrinone (5/11-5/12) after initial TTE was concerning for severely diminished LV function. Follow-up TTE 12 hours later was normal (on milrinone), and remained so after milrinone was discontinued 5/12. Follow-up TTE after discontinuation remained normal. Cardiac MRI was completed 5/14, although read remains pending. He received IVIG on 5/11, and was started on methylpred 50 mg IV BID, Anakinra 100 mg SQ BID 5/14,  and transitioned to prednisone 30 mg PO BID with clinical improvement, down-trending troponin and systemic inflammatory labs.  Subsequent CBCs have been notable for rising leukocytosis (5/16 WBC 56.3) and thrombocytosis (5/16 plts 690) and 4&#43; spherocytes (with no known personal or prior history of spherocytosis). He will likely be discharged 5/17.   Infectious evaluation was unrevealing including cultures and viral studies. COVID spike and nucleocapsid antibodies were sent, but remain pending. Pt. initial COVID-19 infection was diagnosed October 2020, with positive saliva PCR testing.  He was symptomatic for 3-5 days.  He received his second dose of the Pfizer COVID19 vaccine 4/27 in his left arm; denies any significant reactions (arm swelling, injection site redness, lymphadenopathy, myalgias, fatigue, or fever). He has had passing contact with school classmates who have recently been diagnosed with COVID19.

                                                This is a 18 y.o. male who is generally healthy. He received a second dose of the SARS2-COV vaccine on 3/4. The following morning he felt feverish and achy with malaise. He stayed home, drank fluids and rested and felt well enough to come up to ski this weekend. During skiing he had some anterior chest pain, it resolved and he went about his day. Tonight at 2245 the pain became sharp and awakened him from sleep. He felt nauseated and clammy as well. Father brought him to the ER for evaluation. His emergency department evaluation showed ST elevations most notably in the inferior and lateral leads as well as in the lateral precordium.

Noted the following day this his eyes looked yellow, more that usual, and came to the clinic on 3/1/21 for evaluation.  was feeling better but due to acute jaundice had blood work that indicated markedly elevated bilirubin and low platelets.  Further testing for hepatitis was negative.  Was sent to the ER the following day as we were unable to get blood drawn and GI consult was desired.  There he had a normal abdominal US and bilirubin had dropped and he has since been followed by GI and is currently being evaluated by Hematology for any underlying conditions that may be contributing.

During that time, patient experienced headache and nausea. Patient did mention that he usually eats right after waking up but on 3/31/21 he didnt eat anything in the morning. His parents gave him water and he felt a lot better. Pharmacist called 911 because we thought that his throat was closing up but it was just nausea and his spit was coming up. After the 911 came they checked him out and he was doing okay and felt much better and did not had to go to emergency room. He was okay and then left after 30 minutes of observance. I also called the patient at around 4 pm to make sure he was okay and patient said he was fine and was felling normal like before.

Question is whether he should get the second shot or not. Is 6 to potentially 8 days of side effects a concern? Also, parent has been curious as to whether son was a long hauler from covid for brain fog but son thinks it could be burnout from school. Strange that  had such a long lasting reaction compared to to others his gneral age, including those who had covid after he had it so longer ago.

                                                At time of vaccination ~5 minutes after the injection of the pfizer vaccine I developed a tightness in my throat, I was still waiting in line and I did not think much of it, therefore I did not alert the medical personnel about the reaction. Approximately @15mins after the injection I left the site and developed a sense of something wrong and did not feel &#34;right&#34;, my chest became tight, hoarseness in my throat and speach, lightheaded, and I remember taking a sip of my coffee thinking it was more difficult to swallow than usual. May I note I was in the passenger seat and not driving the vehicle. I alerted my mother of the reaction, both sceptical because of my hx of no known allergies. We both figured as long as I can breath and I was still conscious, with no signs of cyanosis I would be fine. At around 10:45 I took my BP: which was 106/62 I typically run low. I then took two 25mg Benadryl capsules which did help the throat tightness to an extent, however the tightness in the chest, lightheaded and dizziness still persisted. I was aware of the potential for Bi-phasic anaphylaxis so we had an Epi-pen on stand by just in case. I was stable for the rest of the day. At approximately 10pm I did notice a small erythematous non-pruritic rash across my chest. The symptoms of the reaction did subside within 24hrs. I remained in stable condition and recovered with time.

                                                At 2-8-21 at approximately 1:00pm I recieved my 2nd shot. At 5:00am on 2-9-21, I woke up experiencing an extreme headache, nausea, body aches, and severe chest pain. I checked my heartrate with a PulseOximeter and found it to be elevated at 105-115. I called out of work and rested in bed for the day. On 2-10-21 most of my symptoms had subsided however the chest pain persisted through 2-11-21. On 2-11-21 at 2:00pm, I visited the Urgent Care. While there, the provider ran an ECG, Chest X-Ray, and bloodwork. Test results showed Troponin levels in my blood had reached critical levels of 7.72ng/ml. I was immediately transported to the ER at the Hospital, where upon arrival they did an EKG and bloodwork. I was then admitted and seen by a cardiologist, who ordered an CT Angiogram, more bloodwork, and an Echocardiogram. After I was admitted, my mother contact the nurses station to check on me and asked what was wrong. She was then told the hospital was treating me for an NSTEMI and Myocarditis. This resulted in a 3 day hospital stay where the results of the tests showed there was nothing wrong with my heart other than the increased Troponin levels. It should be noted that I have had ZERO previous cardiac issues, or any other significant health issues. I was discharged from the hospital with lower but still elevated Troponin levels, and told to follow up with my primary care doctor. I had no health issues and felt fine until I had my second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.  I have copies of my hospital records detailing all of this.

The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient experienced severe stomach pain on 06Apr2021 with outcome of not recovered. The reported event was considered an Important Medical Event.  The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood test: on 10Apr2021 and  computerised tomogram: on 10Apr2021  .    Course of the event. The reporter stated that  her 19 year old son had his first vaccine on 01Apr2021, they didn&#39;t know anything and on 07Apr2021 he got severe stomach pain in the middle of the night. The reporter said they tried to self medicate, that maybe he was just dehydrated because he had been outside. The reporter says they went to the ER on 10APR2021 with the same pains but they couldn&#39;t find anything on the CAT scan. The reporter says they gave him something to relax his stomach, she can&#39;t remember what, and that it appeared to work but now he is off work with severe stomach pains. She says they changed what he ate, they are not sure what happened.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA  The vaccine was administered to the writer at 0800 on 1/5/2021. No immediate reactions were noticed for the 30 minutes observation period immediately after. The writer&#39;s muscle that received the vaccine began to become increasingly sore throughout the day; however, that was similar to the first dose of the same vaccine a few weeks prior. The pain was described as constant (2/10) but aggravated with motion. The pain did interfere with the writer&#39;s normal range of motion (specifically raising the writer&#39;s arm above shoulder height). From 0800-2200 on 1/5/2021 no noticeable symptoms except for the injection site pain occurred.   At 2200, the writer rapidly developed chills, body aches, a headache, fatigue, and a fever of 100.8. These symptoms were left untreated and continued through the night (the symptoms did not interfere with sleep). The writer woke up at 1300 on 1/6/2021; all previous symptoms had resolved by this time except for the injection site pain. By 1400 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed pain near the right axillary lymph nodes. The pain can be described as moderate (1/10) and generally occurred only with motion. The writer was unable to palpate any swelling in the area. Around 1800 on 1/6/2021, the writer noticed it felt weird to swallow. Specifically, it felt as if there was a slight internal swelling 1-inch subhyoidally and 1-2 inches laterally within the right side of his neck when he swallowed. The swelling was not palpable from the skin&#39;s surface. The writer did not seek medical attention as breathing/eating/drinking were not made more difficult but monitored this closely. The swelling in the neck resolved by 2000 on 1/6/2021. The lymph node pain in the right arm resolved over the course of a few days and was no longer present by 1/9/2021 at 1300.

                                                Initial presentation Patient was in his usual state of good health until 4/19 when he received his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Two hours after the injection he became nauseous and vomited multiple times. Overnight he experienced diffuse myalgia and suprapubic pain. He awoke the next day to a pustular rash on his chin, forehead, chest and back. The patient describes similar previous rashes that have resolved spontaneously. The next day he began to experience gross hematuria and presented to the ED with a temperature of 98.9, blood pressure of 100/69mmHg, heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute and an O2 saturation of 97% on room air. On examination, patient was ill-appearing with diffuse pustules on his face, chest and back, periorbital edema, and leukoplakia of the tongue and buccal mucosa. His abdomen was soft and tender to palpation in the suprapubic area and at both costovertebral angles. Hospital course In the ED the patient was found to have a metabolic acidosis of pH 7.33 with an anion gap of 16, lactate 2.6, neutrophilic leukocytosis (22k), acute renal insufficiency with a BUN of 45 and creatinine 3.81 (baseline is 0.76). The patient?s urine demonstrated packed RBCs and 5-10 WBCs. He was admitted to the medicine service for further management. On the medicine floor he was initially found to have rhabdomyolysis (CK 584), worsening renal failure (Creatinine 8), follicular conjunctivitis by skin biopsy, a low CD3/CD4 count (CD4 91, CD3 47, CD8 258) with normal complement, and bilateral tinnitus. CT A/P without contrast showed increased attenuation of renal pelves and ureters consistent with hemorrhage, but no renal stones or hydronephrosis was seen. The patient was treated with pulse dose 500mg IV Methylprednisilone for 3 days and then transitioned to 60mg Prednisone. The patient?s pustular rash and oral leukoplakia greatly improved while on pulse dose steroids, but his kidney function continued to decline (Creatinine rising from 8 to 11), and the patient?s bilateral tinnitus progressed to bilateral sensorineural deafness over 2 days. Bilateral hearing loss prompted an MRI of the brain which identified several punctate infarcts across multiple vascular territories in bilateral cortices and left cerebellum. The patient?s kidney function has continued to decline, with progressive hyperkalemia and hemodialysis was begun.

                                                Around 10pm, I was suddenly very tired and could not stop yawning. I typically am up until 12-1 most nights so this was out of the ordinary. While getting ready for bed I became very nauseous and almost threw up.  I had waves of nausea for around 20 minutes. When I stood up I had chills throughout my body and my skin was covered in goosebumps.  A little later, my vision started to go black and I felt dizzy and light-headed. I went to bed shortly after in hopes of sleeping it off (probably 10:45-11).  Around 2 am the following morning, I woke up and had a hot flash (could have been a fever but I did not check my temperature). I was able to fall back asleep and felt normal when I woke up at 7:30 am.

When I got home I had become extremely nauseous and developed severe muscle fatigue and severe arthralgia and my headache had increased and became sweaty and dizzy. I slept from 9:00am to 2:00pm where the symptoms had gotten no better and the headache had gotten worse. I slept from 3:00pm to around 6:00pm with the same symptoms but managed to eat some soup and kept it down. I slept from 10pm to 12pm the next day 12/10/20. My fatigue and joint pain had somewhat dissipated but I was still experiencing severe nausea and a severe headache. By the end of 12/10/20 around 8pm my joint pain and muscle fatigue had gotten better but the nausea and headache were still there. 12/11/20 I was well enough to drive and receive a covid test. My nausea and headache did not go away until the end of day 12/11/20

He then became very pale and fainted while in the vaccination chair. After a few seconds he regained consciousness.

A 23-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 29Apr2021 at 1 pm (around 12:20ish as reported) (Lot Number: FN6206) (at 23-year-old) at single dose in arm right for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect, no additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect, no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks, no family medical history relevant to AEs. The patient stated he is a pretty healthy guy. All day after getting the vaccine he was fine. He got the shot at like 1 came home took a nap, ate some dinner, and was playing XBOX with the boys when this happened. At around 10:30 pm on 29Apr2021 he went to rub, his stomach just above his belly button and it hurt. He said that he read on line that that area is called the pancreas or liver, it has a lot of names for that area when looking online. He stated it&#39;s the left upper abdomen area he felt pain when he pressed on it. It radiated really fast across his abdomen while he was on the phone with mother. The more he pressed the more the pain got sharper, and it radiated right across the abdomen, mainly above belly button not too much in lower abdomen, not much in upper abdomen. It was very sensitive. He didn&#39;t have to press hard to trigger the pain. It was almost like the area was inflamed. It happened really fast and that it was his upper stomach not so much the lower part of his abdomen. He felt dizziness and nauseous and like a silly boy he tried to run to the bathroom. He stated that he fell and fainted. His butt was still a little sore from falling. He said when he woke up, he was sweating like he had been out side all day. He did not recall sweating any time he fainted in the past. The side effects were gone after about ten minutes. He was really light headed and had the crazy sharp pain in abdomen for about ten minutes and then it was gone. He had never had that kind of pain. He was laying on the floor for a couple minutes. He went to get his phone, and then sat back down and was sweating. He still had pain at that time but it only lasted about 10 minutes at most. He was still a little bit sore in some joints which was not unexpected. He confirmed that he had a little bit of sweating, and he fainted a little bit. Since the episode he hasn&#39;t felt any symptoms like that before, he has not had any pain like gastritis but he has had some random gastrointestinal things before. It&#39;s also reported nausea on 29Apr2021. No required to emergency room and physician office. He was on the verge of going to the ER while the pain was there. He was going to go until it stopped and to get checked out. No relevant test. The outcome of the events sore joints, dizziness and butt sore was unknown; for other events was resolved on 29Apr2021.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I got my second pfizer vaccine 0n 1/27/21 at 10 am.  I had no reactions at all after the injection was given.  I waited for 30 minutes and was perfectly fine.  Around 5 pm I started to feel symptoms.  I got the worst aches in my entire body i&#39;ve ever felt before, along with chills.  I felt extremely hot, I took my temperature and had a fever of 102.3.  I felt dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseas .  My head was throbbing.  I ended up taking 1000mg of tylenol to help reduce the fever, which seemed to really help.  I fell asleep and woke up the next morning drenched in sweat.  My fever was gone, but I still had a horrible headache and threw up from the nausea I was having.  It felt like I had a horrible hangover.

                                                Nausea and Headaches occurred about 5 hours after the injection, since then they have come and gone periodically, usually lasting about 30 minutes, then going away for a few hours. I have been experiencing tightness in my chest and dyspnea upon exertion since about noon, Tuesday, March 23.  NSAIDs have helped relieve some discomfort. Last night, I woke up with racing heart palpitations and tingling in my extremities. Today, I have experienced a sore neck and cramps in my legs, tingling in my extremities, and chest tightness with tachycardia. I have spent the week studying for an exam on Friday, so I plan on going to urgent care afterward.

Compelled by an act of stupidity to eat a muffin at 10:30pm went to bed around midnight. Woke up around 1am feeling queasy and began projectile vomiting. Evacuated all of that and then had a dry heave and it was over. In all only lasted about 6-7 minutes. I got the sheet I was handed when I was given my vaccine and saw this website. I looked at the chart and saw this did occur with the second dose and  saw that this was relatively common in getting the second shot of the vaccine and just wanted to report it since I?m not about to go to sleep. Checked my temperature and it is around 96 and was around 98 when I was going to bed at around 11pm

                                                Approximately 13 hours after receiving the vaccination, I started to experience a bit of confusion and then uncontrollable  chills for about a half hour. I then started to experience a low grade fever. After sleeping through the night I woke up with a strong headache and nausea and continuation of the fever. Symptoms continued for the rest of the day including exhaustion. The symptoms eventually subsided in the late afternoon.
