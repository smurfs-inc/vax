A 90-year-old male patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL5318), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 31Jan2021 12:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included blood thinner  (doctor basically wants to thin his blood due to his age and so forth) from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, the patient mentioned this to his doctor did want him taking the baby aspirin every day of the week but he told his doctor he bled too much and his doctor &#34;well oh okay&#34;. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN) as blood thinner, lisinopril, metoprolol succinate and amlodipine besilate. The patient previously took flu vaccine. The patient received his COVID vaccination around 12:30 Sunday afternoon. He felt fine for the next 2 hours and then he started feeling a little sore and so forth. By evening, the patient was sore and aching all over on 31Jan2021. This is the only side effect he had, everything else went fine. He could hardly get out of bed yesterday because he was so sore all over and it was the same today. The patient stated, &#34;I keep shrinking at this age&#34;. The patient found that when he gets out of bed and forces himself to walk around very carefully, it seems to get a little better. Today, the soreness was down in his abdominal area and the base of his spine. The rest has seemed to clear up. The patient confirmed it has improved some. The doctor did a blood test about two weeks ago prior to the vaccine and it came back excellent in Jan2021. The patient wants to know if it is okay to take Advil or something like that to reduce the pain. The outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Severe abdominal pain unable to eat or sleep for 36 hours. He went by ambulance to the Hospital emergency room. They tried to pump his stomach but he aspirated and and went into cardiac arrest. He was revived but never regained consciousness. (The ICU Dr said that he had blood clots in his abdomen from a recent stroke. We were unaware of him having a stroke other than in 2026. The same Dr. said that he had necrosis in his lungs from aspirating. The necrosis was from his bowel dying) He was put on a ventilator and given drugs to increase his heart rate. On 3-5-21  the heart drugs were reduced and he died. I was with him when he recieved the vaccination and he was healthy, just old. I think that the shot killed him.
