I was alerted by the pharmacy technician I was needed outside of the immunization room and patient had vomited. It seemed to be mostly stomach acid (no food particles) and was roughly 12oz or less of fluid (hard to tell since it was contained in a plastic bag. Patient sipped on some water, which she tolerated well. She stated she suddenly felt really dizzy and then felt the need to throw up. After the water, she felt better and was looking to see if eating something would help settle her stomach. She did not appear pale or diaphoretic. I encouraged her to stay longer for continued observation by she left before 15 minutes were up after the vomiting. She was in the pharmacy observation area for about 20 minutes total. She smiled and waved as she left.

Pulse ox was 99.  There is no labored respirations.  She did not respond to commands but according to his sibling she does not always respond to commands.  However when I took her hand to get her to squeeze my hand and gave it back to her she purposefully put it back on a CD which she was holding to her chest.  Blood pressure was stable heart rate was approximately 130.  The home care aide was not able to tell me whether or not this was her baseline.  Her brother said that she does not does not answer questions depending on the day.  However I am not sure he is the appropriate historian.  She has a history of multiple medical issues including autism, quadriplegia, asthma, and food allergies.  As such she was kept here for a full 30 minutes.  At no time was there any color change.  No labored breathing or wheezing on exam.  There is a little bit of nystagmus and appeared to focus when questioned about how she was doing but without a verbal response.  She will be transferred to the emergency room in stable condition emergency room has been notified.

                                                Patient started to feel strange within 1 minute of receiving the vaccine.  Within 5 minutes of receiving the vaccine, patient felt very faint, dizzy, nauseous, tingly, lost feeling in lower body, blurry vision, and started shaking.  EMS was called at vaccination site.  EMS arrived about 5 minutes later and took patient&#39;s blood pressure.  First reading was 102/70, second reading a few minutes later was 108/76.  By that time, patient could sit up and was alert and oriented.  Patient never lost consciousness.  Patient was not taken to the ER.   Patient remained on-site for another 45 minutes until symptoms resolved enough that she felt it was safe to leave.  Patient has not had a reaction to vaccines or other medical treatment in the past.

It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache. The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room. While the patient was in the emergency room triage, while hospital staff were getting her blood pressure and temperature, her symptoms also started to involve the right side of her face. Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen.

The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects.

An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in right arm, on 26Jan2021 at 07:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included birth control pill. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel (CRYSELLE) from 26Jan2021 as birth control pill. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Jan2021 at 08:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization (in right arm). The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. The patient was a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a hospital. The patient and her mother both work at the same hospital that administered their COVID-19 vaccines, both received the first and second COVID-19 vaccines at the same date and time. The patient received her second COVID-19 vaccine dose yesterday (26Jan2021). Since 26Jan2021 around 09:00 PM, the patient was experiencing symptoms of chills, headache, fever, and nausea. The patient had a fever, clarifying that the highest temperature was 101.4 degrees, and also has chills and headache. Last night (26Jan2021 at 09:00 PM), the patient&#39;s stomach was not feeling right, had a low-grade temperature, and chills. On this morning (27Jan2021), the patient was throwing up. The patient didn&#39;t throw up until this morning and has vomited 4 times today. The patient has not sought medical treatment from an emergency room or doctor yet. The patient has been throwing up today. If the patient continues throwing up, and becomes dehydrated, she may need to go the emergency room. It was also reported that the patient started ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel last night. The patient&#39;s mother thought that the patient&#39;s initial stomach upset may have been caused by the ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and fever including ibuprofen and acetaminophen; the patient isn&#39;t taking anything for nausea at this time. The patient&#39;s mother wanted to see if anyone else had been reporting these side effects the patient has been experiencing since receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine dose. The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

Around 3 PM patient told another patient sitting in the waiting room that she was feeling light headed and told her to call the pharmacy staff, which she did. One of the RPhs went out of the pharmacy into the waiting room to check up on her while the other pharmacist called 911. RPh who went to check up on her found her on the floor slouching. RPh tried to shake her awake and she appeared nodding off and on. Finally after a minute of two, she became more coherent and conscious. Team member grabbed orange juice to give to her. Other patient who grabbed our attention stated she was slowly sliding off her chair. RPh stayed by her side until paramedics arrived. Although she marked &#34;No&#34; on Section B #5 on the VAR form, she stated that she gets light headed and dizzy whenever she gets blood drawn or at the dentist. Paramedics checked on her vitals, was within normal range. Patient opted not to be taken to the hospital.

Slept 1.5 days, out of breath walking to bathroom from bed. Treated with sleep and sips of water, soup.  However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

                                                The night of the day I got the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, I felt like my stomach was on fire. I also felt really bloated. It felt like someone placed a sphere in my abdomen and then set it on fire. I tried eating, drinking water, and sleeping and nothing has helped. I have felt like this since then and it is currently 3/5 and I got the vaccine on 3/3.

                                                Got second dose of vaccine the morning of March 10th.  Had the &#34;expected&#34; symptoms of fatigue, headache, and chills the evening of March 10th. Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out.

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time.

                                                Received the shot at 2:10.  2:15, she was feeling light headed and tingly sensation in her extremities. She didn&#39;t let anyone know at this time.  The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

                                                Part one: Within one minute of injection, I was extremely dizzy and had to force myself to breathe. My hearing became muffled and I couldn&#39;t hear. I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

She wanted to know if it was normal to take that long to feel side effects or should she be worried about actually having COVID. There was no prescriber. She had it as a part of work. When it rolled out, they were a part of it and if you work on COVID unit, they said you should get it. She got the vaccine on Tuesday, 05Jan2021, and started feeling symptoms on Friday, 08Jan2021. She started getting worse on 09Jan2021 and 10Jan2021. Furthermore, patient then reported that the headache started 3 days after receiving the vaccine. It persisted for the first 3 days and then after she got other symptoms, it subsided. Headache in the morning when she first woke up and persisted throughout day. Since then she will wake up in the morning with a slight headache. Soreness in arm was when it was first administered (05Jan2021), that was normal and she usually gets soreness no matter what vaccines she gets. This lasted for 2 days and then went away. She did say that the flu vaccine and some other that she did not remember the name of were the ones she remembered getting sore from. She did not have a manufacturer, lot or expiration for any of them. The fourth day was when she had a sore throat and coughing, that started in the morning when she woke up around 10:00. She had it all day yesterday and it was pretty severe and then she started getting better later in the night. Today it was less, but still here. She did take something to try and make herself feel better, so it definitely helped. Loose stool improved and today (12Jan2021) was yet to be known. Loose stool started in the afternoon of 06Jan2021. No ER (emergency room) or physician&#39;s office required Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events sore throat, coughing, and felt like a mild cold. The patient had not recovered from the event headache. The patient recovered from loose stool and soreness in left arm in Jan2021. The outcome of the events sore throat, and coughing was recovering. The outcome of the event &#34;felt like a mild cold&#34; was unknown.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                5 mins post 1st dose vaccination patient began feeling nauseous, throat felt tight with mild pain when swallowing, tingling sensation from the chest down to her toes, facial flushing, and dizziness. She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins. Patient was monitored for over 45 mins. She was instructed to contact her PCP and her allergist to be cleared for her second vaccine dose. She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

She said she didn&#39;t feel well, and she didn&#39;t want lunch. Then she went and vomited. We took her temperature, and it was normal. We talked to her, made sure she was oriented. She then had a bout of diarrhea in the bathroom. It took about an hour for her color to completely come back and for her to feel better. She called Pfizer and spoke to them to make a report. They told her they have not had reports like this a few days after the vaccine was given. We were not sure if she should have the 2nd round or not.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

Suddenly she woke up in the night with debilitating chills, headache, body ache, and nausea. She is very ill and has vomited 5 times since then (it?s 10:30am now). She can hardly keep water or medicine down. No sign of a fever. Right now she is moaning in agony next to me. She seems sicker now than when we actually had Covid-19 in November 2020.

The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

Her condition worsened to feeling nauseous and blurred vision, so patient asked to lie down.  We found a quiet area in the employee break room for the patient to lay down.  and provided her a pillow, water, cool compress for her head, and later, orange juice for her comfort. We proceeded to call 911 for medical attention. EMS professionals evaluated patient&#39;s vital signs and patient signed waiver refusing to go to hospital, since she was feeling better. Patient left on her own accord with a friend driving her home.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 15Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient received the immunization in a hospital. Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos, allergic asthma, and fracture. Concomitant medication included drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (NIKKI) for birth control. There were no other vaccines given in four weeks. The patient previously took tramadol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and experienced allergies. On 28Jan2021 at 11:00, the patient experienced right sided numbness, severe headache, and nausea, which were serious for disability. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The patient was treated in the emergency room and sent home with TIA protocol to follow with neurologist. There was no COVID prior or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available the causal association between the reported events right sided numbness, severe headache, and nausea and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded but also the contributory role of the concomitant medications/medical history of the patient need to be taken into consideration. The case will be reassessed should the additional information be available.

The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height. AE Details and time of onset: Sore Throat 12:00 on 29 Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling 20:00 Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102: 21:00 Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes- 21:00 Migraine- 21:00 Frequent Urination 23:00 Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids 23:00 Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in: 21:00. ER or physician&#39;s office required: Went to urgent care 36 hours after administration. No treatment given. She just wanted to make sure no additional infection was causing anything weird. All test were negative. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks): none. Events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102 were serious with criteria of medically significant, while the other events were non-serious. The outcome of the event Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling/Sore throat (Condition worsened) was unknown, the outcome of the events Swollen joints and could not move arm that received vaccine in, Chills, body aches, spiked fever of 102., Migraine, Dark colored urine despite pushing fluids, Frequent urination was recovering, while the outcome of the other events was not resolved.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a possible contributory role of the suspect products cannot be excluded for the reported events due to temporal association.

I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

                                                The first day 1/07/21 I started with a pain on my throat , my throat felt really sore however I was still able to eat . The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

                                                Per email received on 1/18-So I had my first dose of Pfizer?s covid vaccine last Friday (3pm). I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

                                                On 1/20, I got a headache, dizziness, and my arm was extremely sore. Within about an hour, I became extremely nauseous and had both chills and sweats. I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                So I received the vaccine on my left arm on January 20th and the next day I had swelling on my left arm and neck. It went away within an hour or so. However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

When waking up the next morning, I had felt a slight fever, chills, nausea, continuous fatigue, and headaches throughout the day. Once I woke up the next day, 2/1, my fever and chills had completely gone away, however I was still feeling fatigue, headaches, and nausea and have not stopped feeling these symptoms since. My fatigue most notably has been present enough to where I?ve needed to call out of work. Eating meals also does but subside the fatigue by a substantial amount.

I had to go to the hospital, where I received fluids and other treatments from Saturday to Wednesday. I developed more nausea and diarrhea in the hospital the last two days I was there, which were attributed to a stomach bug that had been going around in my home.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

                                                After my first dose, I had a sore arm for a few days. After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

Took 2 ibuprofens which helped the fever, but still had trouble sleeping. Later in the morning 8am, had same symptoms plus had 3 different sudden episodes of dizziness,  nausea, and light headedness. I had to physically sit down as it felt like I might pass out. From 9am-1pm the symptoms steadily decreased until there was just a bit of muscle weakness. I was taking ibuprofen every 6hrs.

Patient felt fine when she left the pharmacy and headed home. 20-30 minutes after she left the pharmacy she began to feel that she was having trouble swallowing and eventually noticed that she was having trouble breathing and had bumps on her tongue as well as swollen lips. She drove to the ER and arrived at 3:50 PM where they administered her EpiPen along with benadryl and prednisone. She felt better within 15-20 minutes of EpiPen administration and remained in the hospital for 4 hours until her blood pressure was stable. She is still taking prednisone and has not had any other issues since ER discharge.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

Slept for 10-12 hours. Woke up fine, had no issues or symptoms. Later on as the day progressed, around noon-1pm, I noticed I had started to get a headache and some dizziness. Daily headaches and vertigo are normal for me, currently seeing a neurologist for this, but I realized that this was getting worse from the daily headaches and vertigo that affects me. Took 2 Excedrin extra strength migraine relief to no relief.

At 4AM on January 20th, this patient awoke with chills and muscle/joint aches. This patient did not take a temperature at the time (knowing these were common symptoms), and instead managed them with Advil and Tylenol. On Friday the 22nd, this patient awoke with worsening chills and sudden nausea. She took her temperature, which was 100.5. This patient called employee health and asked if symptoms lasting  over 48 hours were ordinary or if she should be tested for COVID-19. Employee health informed patient to get tested in case of exposure. Patient was negative, however remained nauseous and had low grade fevers and aches. On the 23rd, patient awoke with severe nausea and vomiting. Patient called her primary care provider for zofran prescription, which was granted.  Zofran was taken around the clock until 1/26. Additionally, patient continued to have chills and aches until 1/25, again managed by alternating Advil and Tylenol.  Also on 1/25, patient noticed flat, erythemic rash covering her abdomen and back. Patient applied hydrocortisone cream and took Benadryl. As of today, 1/27, patient is afebrile, not nauseous, and rash has disappeared.

I took Tylenol twice that day and felt a small amount of relief. I woke up the following day, 2 days after the vaccine, still feeling nauseous, had a headache, temperature 100.4, fatigue, and body aches. I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. 3 days following the vaccine I am still having nausea with vomiting, body aches, and fatigue, my temperature day 3 is 100.1. I had to call into work because of my symptoms and the screening tool used to get into work flagged me.

The most intense headache of my life. I also got an intense stomachache and it felt like I had an ulcer. That progressed to a low grade fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The myalgia and arthralgia were so intense that moving to stretch my legs was incredibly painful. I was also very nauseous. The intensity of the arthralgia and myalgia subsided around 8am on 02/01/2021. All my other symptoms continued until around 11am on 2/2/2021. I still have a headache and some muscle pain, but they are manageable.

I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

I went to bed around 9 pm and had some chills and mild body aches so I took some Tylenol. I woke up around 12pm with sore muscles and cramps/aches in my back, hips, legs, and neck. I also had a mild fever of 100.7 and was nauseous. I took some Zofran for nausea. I had chills and was flushed and sweating. That next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was very fatigued, had little to no appetite, and had a pounding headache. I slept the entire day 1/25. The following day 1/26 I felt better but still groggy, I slept the majority of the day before heading off to work.

A 24-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 11:30 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema and known allergies: NSAIDs, &#34;no gas,&#34; eggs, gluten, dairy. Concomitant medications in two weeks included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), magnesium, and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Dec2020. She did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient reported &#34;I had my second injection at 11:30 on 18Jan2021. By 20:00, I was feeling fatigued and at 23:00, I got the chills and a fever and severe body aches radiating from the left side of my body. These lasted until around 23:00 on 19Jan2021 with a maximum temperature of 100.8. When I woke up on 20Jan2021, I felt fine, no fever, very mild body aches. Around 16:00, I began to feel fatigued again, and at 20:00 I felt I was coming down with a head cold (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, sore throat). At 23:00, I started violently vomiting and I vomited 10-12 times over the next 8 hours. I also spiked a fever of 102.6. I was prescribed ondansetron (ZOFRAN) on 21Jan2021, which kept the vomiting at bay and on 22Jan2021, I had a negative saliva test for COVID. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of feeling fatigued, severe body aches was not recovered; of chills, fever, head cold, and vomiting was recovered.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

I had eaten nothing out of the ordinary on Friday (made pizza at home like I do every Friday), and there were no other abnormalities during the day.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

The nausea and puking went away a couple of hours after it started, so it could have been related to dinner. But the feverish chills continued well into the following day, Sunday 1/10. Sunday morning I woke up still  feverish with a temp of 99.7, and also achy with a slight sore throat. I drank plenty of fluids and napped during the day of 1/10 to break the fever, followed with day-quil and ny-quil at night. On Monday, 1/11 I woke up feeling much improved and no longer felt ill.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

                                                I sat at the hospital for 15 mins after my vaccine shot and was ok. However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

Severe diarrhea began the day after vaccination (3/21/21) at approx. 10pm with symptoms of bloating, heartburn, cramps, gas and soft stool that progressed to explosive watery diarrhea lasting until 11:30pm. On 3/22/21, I experienced a feeling of an unsettled stomach with some mild nausea, decreased appetite, and overall feeling of fatigue throughout the day with mild body aches, which was treated with 1 dose of Advil.

She noted to feeling dizzy when she presented to my station about 15 minutes after her vaccine. She stated to having history of moderate asthma, carries albuterol with her. She denies drug allergy, but had lightheadedness with MMR vaccine in the past. I checked her pulse rate, 94 regular. 5 minutes later, she c/o feeling worse. She had inspiratory wheezing to auscultation, VS stable. BP 122/72, HR 103, pulse oximetry 99%. She had albuterol MDI inhaler with her, I asked her to self-administer 2 puffs. I administered 25 mg of diphenhydramine. She declined 50 mg because she gets very groggy to anti-histamine.  Approximately 3 minutes later, she noted to feeling like her throat is very dry and warm, almost difficult to swallow. She describes sensation like she is breathing thru a straw. Her vitals remain stable: BP 133/74, HR 128, pulse ox 98%. Throat without swelling, redness, no stridors noted, but she continues to have inspiratory wheezing. She declined to have Epi given.  I made decision to call paramedics given high risk for bronchospasm. Paramedics arrived approximately 7 minutes later. Vital signs remain stable. She continues to feel like she is &#34;breathing through a straw.&#34; She is transported to ER

                                                Within a minute after the vaccine was administered, I started to sweat a lot, felt hot, and got very dizzy. I was also nauseous. The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

                                                Within 1 or 2 hours, I was getting hives on my arms and my neck. My throat was getting irritated and swollen a little bit. I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????
