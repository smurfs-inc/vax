I was alerted by the pharmacy technician I was needed outside of the immunization room and patient had vomited. It seemed to be mostly stomach acid (no food particles) and was roughly 12oz or less of fluid (hard to tell since it was contained in a plastic bag. Patient sipped on some water, which she tolerated well. She stated she suddenly felt really dizzy and then felt the need to throw up. After the water, she felt better and was looking to see if eating something would help settle her stomach. She did not appear pale or diaphoretic. I encouraged her to stay longer for continued observation by she left before 15 minutes were up after the vomiting. She was in the pharmacy observation area for about 20 minutes total. She smiled and waved as she left.

She improved the next day but became sick again the day after and every day since. We are now at day 19 and she is still nauseated every day. She vomits periodically about every second or third day. She vomited profusely today on day 19.  I am reporting this because the symptoms shouldn&#39;t last this long.

                                                My daughter was given her 2nd COVID shot at approximately 9:00am on 4-16-2021. We waited 30 minutes after the shot. No issues. That evening at approximately 6:00pm, she had a red rash on her upper chest and throat. She stated that she was having a hard time breathing and swallowing. I gave her  a Benadryl tablet and watched her for approximately 15-20 minutes. she continued to feel tightness in her throat and said it burned when she swallowed. She confirmed again that she felt her throat was swelling. I drove her to the closest ER located at. My daughter was seen and it was determined that she was having an allergic reaction. DR recommended continue Benadryl tab every 4 hours for the next 12-24- hours. We were discharged to home. I administered another does of Benadryl at approximately 10:15pm. My daughter went to sleep. I woke her up at 3:00am to check on her and she stated she did not have a rash and her throat was fine. She was running a low grade fever of 100.5. I gave her 500 mg of Tylenol for the fever. When my daughter woke later that morning at approximately 8:30am, she still did not have a rash or throat swelling. Her fever was gone.

                                                I got the shot at around 4 in the afternoon and after sitting in the waiting area for around 15 minutes I was allowed to leave. When I left I only had a slight headache, but nothing that seemed very noticeable. I felt a tad woozy but it was nothing serious so I went on with my day and went to my sports practice for an hour and a half. After I got home and had eaten, I was working and started to feel the effects. It started with an increasingly worse headache at around 9 and as the night went on it got worse and I constantly needed to lie down. My arm had started to feel sore but it was nothing much. I thought I could sleep it off but woke up feeling horrible. My stomach could not hold any food down and my headache had become really bad. I had to go to my sports game but on the car ride over (around 45 min) I got very nauseous. Throughout the course of the day my headache would get worse any time I tried to run and all I wanted to do was lie down and sleep. I was barely able to stand, let alone run and I felt sleepy all day. My arm had also gotten very sore and any contact on it made me flinch back. I was not able to eat or drink anything until about 4  in the afternoon and my stomach was not sitting right the entire time and I constantly was burping and feeling like I was going to vomit despite having only water in my stomach. After I was able to eat the stomach ache went away a bit but the headache lasted through the night and has finally started to subside two days later.

                                                Arm soreness, tightness in chest, dizziness, nausea, difficulty breathing. Symptoms started pretty much right after getting the shot but the dizziness and tightness in chest stopped after I took a nap about an hour after the shot. As of the submission of the form I am still feeling soreness in my arm but it?s lessened a bit and I still feel nauseous and am having trouble breathing properly.

                                                Per EMT, patient became diaphoretic and pale suddenly approximately 5 minutes after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at a drive-through vaccination site. Patient was in car sitting in the observation area when incident occured. After becoming pale and diaphoretic, EMT lowered the seat and someone held the patient and patient became unconscious for approx. a minute. After consciousness regained, patient wanted to sit-up because she &#34;felt naseous&#34;. Patient sat up and the RN called to incident. When this RN arrived, patient was consious and leaning over and appeared pale/grey and cyanotic.  911 called. This RN put pulse-ox on patient and told EMT to get O2. Patient&#39;s O2 saturations were in the low 80&#39;s and HR 46. Patient immediately layed back in seat of car and put feet up on dashboard and given 5L of oxygen. After approx. 5 minutes on 5L of O2 and laying back, patient&#39;s color improved and stated she &#34;felt much better&#34;. O2 saturations improved to 100 after a couple minutes on oxygen and remained over 98% on RA X 5 minutes. Patient was not taken to the hospital and someone droved patient home with follow-up.

                                                Patient reported feeling lightheaded status post first dose Pfizer COVID vaccine (Lot: EW0167, expiration date: 08/31/2021) to medic. Medic noted that the client was CAOx4,  her skin was pale, warm and slightly moist, pupils were equal, round, reactive to light and accommodating (PEARRL), respiration rate (RR) was 20. The client&#39;s sister stated the client had a history of anxiety and that &#34;she gets this way whenever she gets a shot&#34;. Medic walked patient to the zero gravity chair. The client was given water to sip on. At 1213 baseline vitals were taken with client sitting: Blood pressure (BP): 110/82, heartrate (HR): 98, RR: 20, PEARRL. Medic  reports she coached the client on her breathing  to help alleviate her complaint of feeling lightheaded, mild nausea and anxiety.

At 1220 a second set of vitals were taken while standing: BP 108/80, HR 86, RR 16, CAOx4. Client stated her symptoms were diminishing. Client&#39;s RR slowed down to normal rate and rhythm, vital signs were trending to normal and client was negative for orthostatic pressures.

                                                16 yo female came into our injection site today 05/05/21 to receive her first pfizer vaccine. She was accompanied by her father. Pt received vaccine IM to her left deltoid. Pt completed vaccine at 2:55pm at which she sat down for her 15 minute observation period. As soon as she sat down she called over the staff that administered the vaccine. She explained to her that she felt nausea and was breathing heavily. I then walked over to them and the attendee was very pale and breathing heavily. By that time I had RN getting attendees history from her father, She has no history of allergic reactions, not taking any medications and no current illness. She is &#34;slightly asthmatic&#34; but is not taking any rx.  RN was helping me by putting cold pack behind attendees neck. Pt then proceeded to explain that she felt nauseas and starting dry heaving. RN then brought over trash can and attendee started to vomit. I then started to proceed and take her vitals. first set of vitals were taken at 2:58pm BP: 90/60 HR: 132 RR: 24 O2: 100%. Attendee at this point was diaphoretic, pale, breathing heavily and vomiting. We continued to monitor attendee in which she started to feel better by 3:08 pm. She was no longer pale, diaphoretic or vomitting and was breathing normally. We provided attendee with water and continued to monitor her. Now that pt was calm, I was able to ask her some questions. She stated that she had a smoothie and an avocado toast about an hour prior to vaccine. She explained to me that she does have a phobia to needles and was feeling very anxious prior to appointment. I then repeated her vitals at 3:16pm BP: 98/60 HR:89 RR: 20 O2: 99%.  I had attendee stand up off chair and walk at 3:22pm. She felt fine and did not feel dizzy at all. No signs of distress noted. She was then discharged and walked out with her dad at 3:25pm.

                                                Patient chronic conditions (JIA, UC) previously controlled on adalimumab.  Within several days of receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose #2, patient began experiencing worsening/flare of ulcerative colitis symptoms including stomach pain, diarrhea, fatigue, arthritis pain that lasted beyond the reasonable and known duration of vaccine related side-effects. Symptoms treated with dicyclomine and acetaminophen with no relief.  Symptoms continued x 2 weeks.  Patient ultimately required addition of budesonide to treatment regimen for ulcerative colitis and is currently having relief of symptoms.

                                                Patient started swelling in the left hands on Saturday May 08th and inflammation in the bowel during Monday morning May 10th. She was not able to eat and had nausea. Patient stayed at Hospital until May 13th and got many exams as endoscopy and colonoscopy and did not find any reason for such inflammation. Also, blood exams were ok. The swelling in the hands combined with inflammation on the bowel sound suspect of reaction of Pfizer vaccine as there is no event close to this date to create abnormal effects of swelling and inflammation.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

Her course was complicated by respiratory failure (requiring ICU admission for CPAP), pancytopenia, diarrhea with buttock skin breakdown requiring rectal tube for wound and stool management, and extensive workup which was unrevealing for an infectious cause.  She clinically improved with respect to pancytopenia with discontinuation of felbamate, and completed a treatment course with Zosyn for suspected buttock SSTI.

She remained seated in the room and closed her eyes a couple times but never appeared to lose consciousness.  Her dad joined us in the room and confirmed she was really nervous before the vaccine.  We kept her seated for several minutes and then she said she felt sick and vomited.  After that she started to regain her color and was able to move to the waiting room.  She sat there for about 5 more minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her dad.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Last time at the doctors office was for her well check in Oct or Nov. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine.  On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling. They are not sure if it (anaphylactic reaction) is related to the vaccine. She does not have any allergic issues of any kind and is not sure if it is from the vaccine. The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid.

                                                Extreme abdominal pain/cramping. We ended up taking her to the ER department at the Hospital because the pain was so extreme. In the course of the visit to the ER, they took a CT scan of the abdomen, and there saw evidence of Covid in the lungs. They did a nose swab test, and she tested positive. She had some mild symptoms (stuffy head, headache, mild sore throat) earlier in the week (May 8 - May 9), but we thought it was possibly allergies. Turns out it was Covid and we didn&#39;t know it.  It seems that with the Covid virus already in the system, the shot caused an extreme reaction.

Her eyes rolled back and up then her head fell backward.  I supported her head and her dad was checking her for awareness.  I gave her a bottle of water and she drank some of it.  She indicated that her vision was still not accurate.  Her dad brought her a candy bar and she ate the majority of it and drank the majority of the contents of the water bottle.   We gave her a few more minutes to feel comfortable then I asked whether she was ready to stand up.  She was not.  We gave her a bag of chips and she ate some and finished the water bottle.  After a few more minutes, she stood up and was able to walk without assistance.     Her father indicated that she had an incident like this before, but patient did not remember the previous incident.

                                                Patient started experiencing numbness and tingling on her right side and then all over on Sunday evening 5/2/21. It affected her gait and the numbness and tingling in her legs caused her to have to catch herself and hold on to something to keep from falling. She described that her legs felt weak for a few seconds when walking. This sensation gradually decreased in intensity and duration. When I saw her at 5 pm on 5/3, she had normal gait and only felt the numbness and tingling very briefly. Her exam including her neuro exam was normal on 5/3 when I saw her.  The sensation of numbness and tingling completely resolved by 5/4.  She also experienced HA, nausea and fatigue, but did not have syncope, dizziness or fevers.

                                                Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I woke up at about 4:30 AM and couldn?t fall back asleep, I kept feeling sleepy until I would get jolted back awake over and over. My joints were hurting, I had somewhat severe nausea, my head started throbbing. At about 6:40 AM my migraine started, my arm felt hot to the touch, and I got dizzy so I took some acetaminophen. At 10:00 PM I noticed the area under my left armpit was a little swollen and really sore, my throat and right tonsil was also sore and it hurt to swallow. The next day (today) I have another migraine, my throat and left armpit are still sore,  and my muscles hurt. I?m getting better though.

This lasted about 5 seconds .  She stopped  and then it happened again  for about 5 seconds.  When she came to, she tried to walk away again and had to return to sitting.  Then she vomited twice.  Upon checking her blood pressure after about 30 minutes, it was 97/66.  She sat for a total of about an hour before feeling  good enough to leave.  She was nauseous for the remainder of the day and the next day as well.

I went to check on her and she appeared pale and seemed very drowsy and unresponsive to questions. She continued to complain about dizziness and nausea. Her parents grabbed some water for her and still there was no improvement. I called 911 to report the symptoms and was advised to administer EpiPen. When asked if her breathing improved, she nodded yes, but she did not appear to have improved. She continued to be unresponsive to questions and appeared extremely drowsy. Within 15 minutes, the ambulance arrived.

I took my blood pressure and the reading was 120/71 with a pulse of 54 which is really low. I went to the Dr. to be evaluated. Dr. felt it was a vasovagal response. I will continue to monitor myself and if it continues, I will see a cardiologist.

Then again Mother checked on daughter later on and daughter was unresponsive when mom was tapping her in the face-she was just looking at her mom but not seeing or hearing her -like a black out-- couldnt be woken up easily- and when she did wake she couldn&#39;t see.  But since those 2 episodes daughter&#39;s sight is back but she feels nauseous and has an upset stomach.

We called the EMTs and we advised the patient that syncope is something we have seen in children receiving the vaccine and the EMTs advised of the same thing. They took her vitals all normal and the patient began to see the symptoms disappear. The patient once better and cleared by EMTs went home per their advise.

                                                atient was in for 2nd covid-19 (Pfizer lot was EW0167, exp 8/31/2021):  It was her and her brother receiving the vaccine. Brother went first and was fine. She was second. After receiving the vaccine (~30-60sec) she appeared to lose conciseness (not sure if complete or partial) she said she didn&#39;t remember all of it, but it was more like a dream. During that she had some twitches/spams (involving circular motions with her arms and leg, leg extended and then retracted, but her head rolled back). Upon coming out/waking she appeared sensitive to light and was nauseous. Left her in the room with her mom to get an ice pack, water, paper towel. Total episode lasted less than a minute, but took about 10-15 minutes (estimate, unsure of full time spent) before she felt good enough to use a wheelchair and get in her mom&#39;s car to drive home.

                                                Fever and chills on the 8th and  9th; Over the last couple of weeks, several times that I&#39;ve gone to doctor. On May 18th, she had what was considered to be  a pre-syncope event (almost passed out). And she had a pretty large migraine headache as well - the headache lasted for days - for probably three days. 18th, went to dr and they took her vitals. They were under the impression she passed out from having the migraine (her blood pressure is low but normal, in general). Dr was called on Monday 24th - doctor wanted tests. She had another pre-syncope event on May 1st in school and then had  a fever the rest of the week. (From 6/1/2021 - 6/6/2021 - fever and threw up and bad headache - fever until yesterday). I did take her pediatrician. Negative for COVID and Strep on 2nd . She had another migraine on Tuesday. Pediatrician said it could be a viral infection of some sort. Neurologist believes the migraines were exacerbated by the viral infection as well. This one has lingered and it&#39;s the first time she had a migraine within a week or two  weeks of each other. She was out of school was out 2 1/2 days last week and the week of the 18th she was out of school the 19th and got sick again the 20th and was out.

                                                female here with mom mom multiple siblings for Covid vaccine.  Within 30 minutes of the Covid vaccine patient had a vomiting episode.  Pulse ox was 99.  There is no labored respirations.  She did not respond to commands but according to his sibling she does not always respond to commands.  However when I took her hand to get her to squeeze my hand and gave it back to her she purposefully put it back on a CD which she was holding to her chest.  Blood pressure was stable heart rate was approximately 130.  The home care aide was not able to tell me whether or not this was her baseline.  Her brother said that she does not does not answer questions depending on the day.  However I am not sure he is the appropriate historian.  She has a history of multiple medical issues including autism, quadriplegia, asthma, and food allergies.  As such she was kept here for a full 30 minutes.  At no time was there any color change.  No labored breathing or wheezing on exam.  There is a little bit of nystagmus and appeared to focus when questioned about how she was doing but without a verbal response.  She will be transferred to the emergency room in stable condition emergency room has been notified.

                                                I gave the patient the immunization. She seemed fine after getting the shot. I asked her to go outside the immunization room and wait 15 minutes for observation.  Immediately upon leaving the room, she felt dizzy and made it to the chair to sit down, when she said she briefly blacked out. By that time, her father arrived, and gave her some orange juice to drink. She said she was starting to feel better, but that her stomach felt queasy. After15 minutes, the patient was feeling better and walked out with her father with no other reports of problems.

I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

She walked out of the immunization room to wait in the store, made it about 2 aisles over, and fainted.  Patient&#39;s father and the Pharmacist immediately got to her side.  She came to within less than 1 minute.  In the meantime EMS was called and the Pharmacist waited with the patient until they arrived.  EMS looked over the patient and patient was able to leave on her own after waiting out the nausea and dizziness that had occurred.  Patient also reported a headache which was most likely from hitting her head on the way down.

Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

It then included both sides of her face; patient could not open her eye or control her face; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 17-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8731) via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 at 15:15 (at the age of 17-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant mediations included ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (JOLESSA) taken &#34;to decrease her periods&#34; from 2019 (&#34;about two years ago&#34;) and ongoing and at an unspecified dose, cyclic, for three months straight with no placebo. Then takes a placebo pill for one week straight and biotin taken &#34;for hair and nail growth&#34; from an unspecified date (&#34;she began taking within the last 6 months&#34;) and ongoing. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was not provided whether there were adverse events following prior vaccinations. On 07Apr2021 the patient experienced began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache. The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room. While the patient was in the emergency room triage, while hospital staff were getting her blood pressure and temperature, her symptoms also started to involve the right side of her face. Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen. She was still having the twitching but not as bad when discharged. On 08Apr2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had not completely subsided, but were significantly better. On 08Apr2021, the patient woke up with nausea, chills and a headache. The reporter expected the patient to have these side effects. The side effects continued until very late in the day on 10Apr2021. The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects. The reporter also stated that the second dose was scheduled for 28Apr2021 and she asked if the patient should receive the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the events began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache all recovered/resolved on 10Apr2021.   No follow-up attempts are needed; No further information is expected.

                                                I had administered the vaccine, pt tolerated well, pt given discharge instructions and instructed to wait for 15 minutes at the observation area.   As I was waiting for the next patients to arrive, another technician notified me that she had a reaction of vomiting.  When asked patient stated after the injection she felt burning from the site to the nape of her neck and while waiting at the observation area she had nausea and went to one of our stations to vomit in the trash.  Patient was escorted to our treatment room  for vitals and was given a cold pack for the back of her neck.  Our Allergist provider was called to assess patient.  When I had arrived to the treatment room to observe her, patient stated this was the first time she had this type of reaction.  The provider ordered for her to stay and be observed for 1 hour with 15 minute intervals of vitals.  The patient had no other reactions and had no pain, vitals were within normal limits.

I gave a small soda to drink and she threw up after but she didn&#39;t faint again. She felt better right after she threw up and stated that this never happened before. After about 45 minutes, pt stated that she felt much better and wanted to leave with her dad.

By 12:01 patient was feeling extreme pain in her stomach, was sweating profusely, felt tingling sensation from head down to her stomach (including her arms and hands). Patient began screaming in pain.  Her hands became rigid and paralyzed. She was completely unable to move both hands. Patient was able to feel if someone was touching her hands.  Her face began tingling and feeling numb. Patient was lying down and almost passed our. I asked CVS to call 911 and if they should administer an epi pen.  The epi pen was not administered.  I (mother) went w/ child in the ambulance to  Hospital. EMT monitored her vitals, which were normal. Patient was still unable to move her hands until after she was admitted to Hospital. Patient did not receive any IV r medication at Hospital. The sensation in her hands slowly came back with the numbness subsiding  after about 1.5 hours in the ER. Patient was discharged at about 2:00pm on 5/16/2021.

She felt nauseous and dizzy. I laid her on floor with her feet elevated on a chair with her head to the side so she would not aspirate if she vomitted.. She felt better after a while and wanted to sit. When she was sitting in the armchair she vomitted and said she felt worse, so I then called 911.   They evaluated her and her blood pressure was very low and they gave her iv fluids and took her to the emergency room

                                                Patient was very anxious and breathing heavy. About 5 minutes after the vaccination they started to hyperventilate and ended up throwing up. After letting them sit and relax for 5 minutes, the patient then had to throw up again and told their mother they felt like they were going to faint. Mother and myself stood by, while patient did end up fainting. We slowly lowered them to the ground, and on the way down their body got stiff and patient had uncontrollable movements and was hardly responsive. Mother and myself finally got her safely to the floor as they came to and was responding to verbal ques and stimulation from mother. Mother went to get water and i stayed with the patient to ensure no other things happen. Patient ended up doing alright after relaxing for a few and then i walked them and mother to their car and ensured they were feeling good enough to go home. I then advised the mother to seek medical attention.

He is an athlete and not able to do any of the sports  - he starts breathing heavily when he walks across the room. He couldn&#39;t attend school for over a month. Has been to several physicians - a pulmonologist several times; cardiologist; gastroenterologist; his pediatrician. He got a steroid shot - 24th,  given to him for the headaches. Last Monday, the 24th of May (the pulmonologist gave this to him).  It (the headaches pain) was really bad on Tuesday, Wed, Thursday and he started feeling better with the headaches on Friday. He has been given an inhaler and Pepcid for acid reflux (gastroenterologist). These have given him a little relief - but he don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the steroid shot or the inhaler that is helping. Yesterday he tried to go to his Sports class and he couldn&#39;t do it - there was a problem with breathing; a lot of shortness of breath. The headaches and the breathing issues are still what are debilitating him the most.

                                                Patient told us that she has passed out and vomited after receiving vaccines in the past. After getting the vaccine, she didn&#39;t feel well. We monitored her in the vaccine room for about 5 minutes. She had a drink of water, then when she was ready, her family helped her into the lobby I returned to the pharmacy, and continued to watch her. The patient&#39;s mom came to the window and said patient had fainted. I went to her, and said we need to lower her to the floor. At that point, mom said patient was not breathing I quickly lowered her to the floor, while dad supported her head. I didn&#39;t have time to verify that she wasn&#39;t breathing, because as soon as she touched the floor, she began convulsing, then sat up and w was immediately awake. She sat up, and we explained that she had passed out and I had her lie down. I stayed with her for a few minutes, asking if they wanted an ambulance (which mom and dad declined) while making sure she was ok. She was just resting at this point, so I returned to the pharmacy, and ask them to let me know if anything changed I continued to watch her from the pharmacy window, and the patient said she was nauseated. We gave mom a bag, and patient vomited in the bag. After a couple more minutes, she seemed to be recovering, and mom and dad helped her out of the store. I followed up with mom at 4:15pm, and mom said patient was still nauseated and had vomited a couple more times. I followed up one last time at 4:45pm, and patient was feeling a bit better, but mom was going to keep an eye on her I recommended that mom take her to a doctor to be evaluated, but mom said she would just keep an eye on her through the night. I told mom that I would follow up again in the morning.

Stood up to leave a minute later and told her mom that she felt dizzy and nauseous. We had her sit back down and she got a little shaky. Face seemed to loose all its color. she said everything went black and she was dizzy. she closed her eyes and laid her head back against the wall. I left the vaccine room to alert my pharmacist and as I walked out the door the patients brother said that she had started shaking like she was having a seizure and she passed out. She was seated and mom was supporting her while we called 911. patient came to within 30 seconds or so and was lethargic and dizzy still. Pharmacist too her blood pressure while waiting on emt and it was 102/52, heart rate 64. emt arrived and took over. emt was with the patient for about 10 minutes then left with her on a stretcher. emt left notes that her vitals while sitting were 93/56, heart rate 66, o2 100%. standing 80/50

An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in right arm, on 26Jan2021 at 07:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included birth control pill. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel (CRYSELLE) from 26Jan2021 as birth control pill. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Jan2021 at 08:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization (in right arm). The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. The patient was a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a hospital. The patient and her mother both work at the same hospital that administered their COVID-19 vaccines, both received the first and second COVID-19 vaccines at the same date and time. The patient received her second COVID-19 vaccine dose yesterday (26Jan2021). Since 26Jan2021 around 09:00 PM, the patient was experiencing symptoms of chills, headache, fever, and nausea. The patient had a fever, clarifying that the highest temperature was 101.4 degrees, and also has chills and headache. Last night (26Jan2021 at 09:00 PM), the patient&#39;s stomach was not feeling right, had a low-grade temperature, and chills. On this morning (27Jan2021), the patient was throwing up. The patient didn&#39;t throw up until this morning and has vomited 4 times today. The patient has not sought medical treatment from an emergency room or doctor yet. The patient has been throwing up today. If the patient continues throwing up, and becomes dehydrated, she may need to go the emergency room. It was also reported that the patient started ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel last night. The patient&#39;s mother thought that the patient&#39;s initial stomach upset may have been caused by the ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and fever including ibuprofen and acetaminophen; the patient isn&#39;t taking anything for nausea at this time. The patient&#39;s mother wanted to see if anyone else had been reporting these side effects the patient has been experiencing since receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine dose. The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

RPh advised patient to wait in the waiting room for 15 minutes to make sure she felt fine. Around 3 PM patient told another patient sitting in the waiting room that she was feeling light headed and told her to call the pharmacy staff, which she did. One of the RPhs went out of the pharmacy into the waiting room to check up on her while the other pharmacist called 911. RPh who went to check up on her found her on the floor slouching. RPh tried to shake her awake and she appeared nodding off and on. Finally after a minute of two, she became more coherent and conscious. Team member grabbed orange juice to give to her. Other patient who grabbed our attention stated she was slowly sliding off her chair. RPh stayed by her side until paramedics arrived. Although she marked &#34;No&#34; on Section B #5 on the VAR form, she stated that she gets light headed and dizzy whenever she gets blood drawn or at the dentist. Paramedics checked on her vitals, was within normal range. Patient opted not to be taken to the hospital. RPh advised patient to call a  family member to pick her up because although she felt ok to drive, she stated she felt a little nauseous and her head kind of hurts. Mother picked her up about an hour after the incident occurred.

                                                migraine at rhe base of my Head; My heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down; extremely nauseous; inability to control temperature regulation; stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains; Not the worst pain I have experienced but definitely not pleasent; lethargic; getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes; Her ribs and lungs hurt; Her ribs and lungs hurt; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer I felt fatigued and my injection site was red and swollen. 24 hours after the vaccine I was experiencing abdominal cramping, headache, and fatigue. 48 hours after I developed a severe full-body rash/hives/welts. It started as a small patch on my left arm and progressed to my hips, legs, arms, chest, back, and face - my whole body. The rash is extremely itchy and has caused me to bust blood vessels from scratching so hard and frequently. I began rotating Benadryl and Zyrtec, but it seemed to make it worse. I visited the ER in the middle of the night on 4/18 where I was given steroids and Benadryl IM along with Pepcid. The rash went away a few hours after, but has since then reappeared and I am currently running a low grade fever of 100.2. I am taking Prednisone 20mg 3x a day as prescribed by my doctor along with Benadryl 50mg every four hours and Pepcid twice a day. Despite these medications the rash continues to persist.

                                                Approximately 5 minutes after vaccine administered, patient started feeling nauseous and dizzy. She was also pale and clammy.  Offered patient water and allowed to remove face mask. Instructed on breathing slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helped briefly but then patient verbalized that she was feeling more light headed and thought she should lie down on exam table. Remained at patient&#39;s side but did not allow her to stand up in order to relocate from chair to exam table. Approximately 7 minutes after vaccine administration, patient briefly lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds and had slight jerking movements during this time. Remained at patient&#39;s side and prevented her from falling out of chair, hitting head, or other injury during syncopal event. After patient regained consciousness, she began sipping on water. A cold, wet paper towel was placed to the back of her neck. Continued to observe patient in exam room for another 5 minutes then she was escorted to waiting area by provider. Waiting area was just outside exam room and patient remained in the presence of a patient care technician, as well as her mother. Patient remained in waiting area for a total observation time of 30 minutes. No other adverse events occurred. Patient and mother both reported that patient does not do well after vaccines and has had similar symptoms after other vaccines in the past.

The leg symptom were present when seen 5 days ago, though were not discussed as Patient wasnt sure if thats what was really starting.  This is associated with a feeling of &#34;not being able to feel muc&#34; and &#34;doesn&#39;t feel right&#34;, as if it &#34;feels foreign... body says this is weird,&#34; and feels heavy.  Also notes that different extremities feel different - left is worse than right. Seen 5 days ago, and noted to have been advised by hematology to stop eliquis approximately 2 weeks prior to onset of symptom after PE/Renal artery embolism 1/2021.  At that visit was referred to ER, where workup for repeat clot was normal (CTA, b/l upper extremities dopplers, head/neck CT, CXR).  EKG was notable for Sinus tach and nonspecific T wave abnormalities.  Discharged home with close follow up. Since then the intensity of the symptom as worsened and the leg symptoms have gotten more pronounced and consistent with the upper extremities symptom.

Someone got a wheelchair and we took her back to observation/treatment area. Patient was very drowsy, felt nauseous, hands were tingling, and was cold and clammy.  We asked her to text her Mom, who was sitting out in the parking lot, to have her come inside.  Pt reported passing out with HPV vaccine and on blood draws.  We moved patient to pt bed and took vitals (listed below).  Patient was able to recover without any medication administration under close observation.  After about 20 mins in obs/treatment area, she was feeling better and we moved her to the observation room with her Mom.  We had leftover vaccine syringes, so Mom received her first dose of vaccine.  They waited together until Mom&#39;s 15 mn obs time was over.  Patient and someone left the clinic feeling fine and under their own power around 1845.

                                                within 34 hours of the 2nd dose of the Pfizer Covid shot, patient began to break out in welts/hives behind her knees. She woke up in the middle of the night with her scalp itching and her ears hot as well as the welts behind her knees. Given Benadryl which helped a little for about 2 hours but then the hives just kept spreading and growing into huge swollen itchy patches on her body. By Friday afternoon, she had tried Benadryl and calamine lotion only to have it continue to get worse. We ended up with the Urgent care by 4pm Friday, 4-30-21. They gave her Prevacid and prescribed steroid cream. They told us if it got worse or affected breathing to go ER. We went home and kept taking the benedryl every 6 Hours and using the steroid cream. as one welt would begin to disappear, others would pop up. the steroid cream did not help in that regard. the benedrul would give about 50% relief for about 2 hours before the itching got very bad. Unable to sleep to do anything, we took patient to the pediatrician that Sat morning 5-1-21. She examined her and told her to take Claritin in the morning and Zyrtec at night to help. She was hestiant to prescribe any steroids due to unknown interaction or affects with the Covid shot. She told us to keep checking in with her and also if it got worse or spread to her face/mouth or any trouble breathing to go to the ER. We went home and tried to take an oatmeal bath. It only made things worse. By 10pm that Sat night 5-1-21, the hives had spread to patient&#39;s face and lips and were affecting her throat. Her voice got very raspy. we decided at that point to take her to the ER. They started her on steroids that night. She continued taking the steroids for 5 days after that. The steroids did help make her hives go away. However, within 2 days of finishing the steroids, patient noticed that she still did not feel 100%. That Saturday 5-8-21, She began to feel light-headed and off. She also began to feel fatigued. She came home from an errand needing to lay down and feeling dizzy. A few days after that, she began to have gas and indigestion, feeling like something caught in her throat and feeling nauseous. She also noticed that there a few nights in all of this that she would wake up shivering for no reason. The shivering would continue until she woke up in the morning. This report is being filed on 5-30-21. Since her 2nd shot and after the hives, we have been dealing with ongoing dizziness, fatigue, tiredness, lightheadedness and nausea to varying degrees. She has not been able to resume regular activates of being active or working out. WE have been back to the dr.

She thought the side effects would go away after the first hospitalization but was readmitted. First admitted to the hospital on 01May2021 for severe reaction to the shot for 5 days then was sent home because they thought the side effects would go away but the side effects have still been heavy. She was admitted again on Friday (14May2021) to the hospital from the side effects that are continuing. States she had lost 14 pounds from the time she was home from her first visit to the hospital. Patient vomiting a lot and couldnt hold food and water down: States that right after she got the second shot a couple of hours later she vomited a lot and couldn&#39;t hold food or water down which started 28Apr2021 and that she hasn&#39;t thrown up since Friday 14May2021, but has improved. She was starting to recover from it, it was just starting to get better. The really bad diarrhea started on the 28Apr2021 and was ongoing. The doctor thinks the second dose of the vaccine caused an ulcerative colitis flare up. She noticed the tachycardia on 29Apr2021.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; formulation solution for injection; Lot number was not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on an unspecified date as 2ND DOSE,SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included Hashimoto&#39;s Disease. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took first dose of BNT162B2 on 31Mar2021 for covid-19 immunization and experienced severe indigestion, vomiting and did not feel well. On an unspecified date (36 hours after receiving the second dose of vaccine), the patient broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching, her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The patient was prescribed steroid creams, and she self-administered three antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl. The hives went away. After that on an unspecified date, the patient had gastrointestinal (GI) issues, she had very gassy feeling of something stuck in the throat, and had nausea to the point of being unable to eat. Also, she shivered and shakes out of the blue, felt lightheaded and dizzy with extreme fatigue. The patient received treatment with steroid creams, and antihistamines included Zyrtec, Claritin, &amp; Benadryl for the events 36h after &#34;broke out with hives and patches all over the body with extreme itching and her ears turned red and became very hot, the hives spread to her face and into the throat. The caller (reporter) mentioned that she heard that the vaccine causes problems in fertility hence caller asked for information on fertility studies with regards to the vaccine in response she was explained reports on the possible side effects, mentioned no information found for non-reported AEs, and referred to health care professional (HCP) for further guidance. Further, caller asked for information on how to treat or go about with the side in response she was informed that Pfizer was unable to make treatment recommendations specific for individual patients and referred to HCP for further guidance. Again, Caller asked, &#34;how the vaccines work&#34; in response she was explained about vaccine mechanism and CDC information. Caller asked if there was a way to measure the spiked proteins in the body as caller wanted to know how to measure/assess immunity after vaccination in response she was being explained about CDC recommendation, and referred to HCP for further guidance. Moreover, caller asked if there were other proteins in the body/organs/cells that were similar to the spike protein that our body could possibly react to in response mentioned that no information found on body components similar to the SARS-CoV2 Spike Protein, and she was referred to HCP for discussion. Caller complained and mentioned &#34;reporter don&#39;t think all this information is being made public, it just seems to me like the issues for the vaccine is much worse for her than as if she got COVID19. Reporter really hope that the Doctors/ CDC / Pfizer and all organizations would reconsider this, especially on the possibility on the issue on the body attacking its own self.&#34; The outcome of the event hives was considered as resolved while the outcome of all other reported events was unknown at the time of this report.  Information on Batch/Lot number has been requested.

An 18-years-old non-pregnant female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: ER8736, expiration date: not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on 14May2021 as single dose for Covid-19 immunisation (Age at Vaccination: 18years).  The patient medical history was not reported. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) 10mg/day (as medications in two weeks) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. No known allergies and no other vaccine in four weeks. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 and since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

She was taken to the hospital, computerized tomogram (CT) Scan, electrocardiogram (EKG) was normal, and no evidence of seizure were there. On 15May2021, the patient was diagnosed with mild con-cussion and got stitches on the chin as therapeutic measure for her chin splitting. Doctor suggested dehydration may had been a factor, also insufficient food intake (had not eaten yet) (start date: 15May2021). The patient stayed home from school for a week with memory improving each day and still did not remember completely a period of 48 hours starting around time of vaccination however, other symptoms had resolved. The patient had never fainted before. The treatment for rest of events was unknown. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan and EKG both as normal, both on 15May2021. The outcome for mild con-cussion and significant memory loss was recovering; and rest all events were resolved.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 25Jan2021 08:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included type 1 diabetes mellitus, Celiac disease, COVID-19, and heartburn. Concomitant medication included insulin lispro (HUMALOG), spironolactone, fluvoxamine, and alprazolam (XANAX XR). The patient previously took gluten, magnesium ,and iodine and experienced allergies.  On 25Jan2021 09:00, patient had an anaphylactic reaction. Throat was swollen shut, couldn&#39;t talk or breathe, loss of consciousness, brain fog, headache, fever, severe body aches and joint aches that make movement difficult, persistent chest pain/pressure, low blood pressure, and some swollen and tender bilateral lymph nodes in my neck/trapezius/left (injection site) axillary region, fatigue, and decreased appetite due to nausea. Patient had a doctor or healthcare professional visit, went to emergency room/department or urgent care, and was considered life threatening illness (immediate risk of death from the event). Events was treated with epinephrine, diphenhydramine (BENADRYL), paracetamol (TYLENOL) and had oxygen. Patient was not tested post vaccination. The patient is not pregnant.

It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

I have felt like this since then and it is currently 3/5 and I got the vaccine on 3/3.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

                                                Following the injection, I made my way to the observation room to wait for 10 minutes. After about two, my left arm began to get extremely hot and I called the nurse in the room over. I began to ask her if it was a normal side effect and began to lose my vision and hearing while talking. I passed out and was wheeling to the side of the room where the doctor was. Upon waking up (after 2/3 minutes) I threw up. The doctor took vitals and such and said everything looked okay. After about 15 minutes I was able to stand and head home.

I decided to leave after sitting for 20 minutes and go back to work because it got a little better. on tuesday.   A few hours later, my chest started to ache and my throat started to hurt. thinking I had asthma due to the heat, i ignored it and used my inhaler.   By the next day, I was coughing and it hurt worse. I was still dizzy but worse, felt neasious and had a headache. I used my inhaler twice with no help. My arm started to hurt to move, and my injection spot became a red lump.   By Thursday, I could barely take a normal breath. It hurt to walk, talk, yawn, sneeze or anything that lifted my need to breathe above bare minimum. It hurt greatly and I couldn&#39;t take a full breath. I felt like my lungs were swollen and my throat hurt to swallow. I was very dizzy and had horrible nausea.

                                                Upon resting later the day of my vaccine at home, my left arm because extremely painful and sore. Which I found to be normal and expected. However, I became very exhausted suddenly and ended up falling asleep 2-3 hours before my normal bedtime.  I woke up 12 hours later unable to motivate myself to get out of bed. Finally, I did and went to go take a shower. I had chills as soon as I got out of bed and had to sit down in the shower for 10 minutes out of exhaustion and had the water running extremely hot but I was still cold. My arm was still in extreme pain. Finally, I arose from the shower floor and began showering when I started to feel as if I was going to puke right away. I laid down in the shower quickly becoming dizzy, and tried to puke. I dry heaved once to no avail. Immediately after dry heaving, my ears went numb and the shower noise was barely audible. My hands went completely numb. Home alone, I knew I needed to get out of the shower before I passed out. I managed to step out of the shower before immediately falling and possibly blacking out for some seconds and fell to the floor and laid there for a minute. Finally, I was somehow able to grab a towel and struggle to my bedroom and laid there numb for about 10 minutes.  This episode ended at about noon but for the rest of the day, I had to sleep on and off, it exhausted me to try and eat,  I had hot flashes, more dizziness, arm pain, and nausea. I called the doctor and they said there was nothing they could do and my symptoms were normal since I had COVID-19 in December.

History is consistent with vasovagal syncopal episode given resolution of symptoms in a quick period of time. Must also consider anaphylactic reaction to vaccine given patient had vomiting and low blood pressures following vaccine administration. However, this is less likely given that patient returned to baseline blood pressures without any additional interventions and has had no additional episodes of vomiting since presenting to the emergency department. Must also consider pregnancy given vomiting and recent Plan B usage

I shook for like 30 minutes after. It has been happening on and off in very short durations for four days now.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

I advised her to sit and I would get help.  as I turned she was standing next to me holding her chest saying she isnt feeling right.  they put her on a bed and was looking for a blood pressure cuff.  they placed a pulseox on her finger which showed 100.  then they placed another clip on her other finger and it showed her heart rate increasing to 138 from 93 in seconds. her face was red her neck was red and she said her heart was racing.   they finally found a BP cuff and her blood pressure was 148/94 which they said this was normal.  it was not. they they told us to seek medical attention.  She continued to complain about chest pain and racing and her face and next continued to be red.  the nurse then gave her 50ml of benadryl with no relief.  She was taking out by wheelchair to a waiting ambulance then to the Hospital Emergency Room.  They treated her with a Steroid and IV.  She was released after about 3 hours.  we came home and 2 hours later went back to the same Emergency room for the same chest pain and racing  at which point  she now had a rash on chest and neck.  this time they gave her medicine to slow down her heart which made her feel better.  she was then released.   Since then she continues to have heart papatations and rashes, and a heard time swallowing with a continue feeling something is stuck in her throat.

As soon as the pharmacist ran to help her, she looks seriously pale, nauseous, sweaty, and then lost all her faculty. She said she could not see anything and started to feel difficult of breathing. The pharmacist immediately gave her EpiPen, and called 911. While waiting for EMS, she started to feel a bit better, could see things. EMS came, measured her blood pressure, and told that she got syncope. They transported her to the hospital.

                                                nausea; passed out; seizure; enlarged heart; hurt knee; sore mouth; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other HCP (patient). A 19-year-old female non-pregnant patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Lot Number: EP7534) via an unspecified route of administration, in the left arm on 20Apr2021 at 11:00 (at the age of 19-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history was none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient has no history of COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient had received other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine: 2nd dose of Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine on 06Apr2021 in the right arm. On 20Apr2021 22:30, the patient experienced passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, enlarged heart, and nausea.  The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time. However, the information provided is very limited and does not allow for a complete medical assessment. Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.

                                                About 10 hours after my second dose, I began to have muscle pain. The muscle pain is different than body aches that I?ve gotten with a cold. My muscles hurt and my skin is sensitive to the touch. It feels like the pain goes from the skin to the bone. I don?t know how else to describe it other than  feeling like a bad a sinus infection inside of my muscles. I know that?s a weird way to describe it but the pain is kind of indescribable and unique. The pain is worst in my neck and back. My joints also feel inflamed, it?s hard to close my hands into a fist. I spent most of the night freezing cold and shivering (I live without air conditioning).  It has been  about 35 hours since I received the vaccine. Cold and shivering has subsided but I have have the sweats for the past 8 or so hours. A bit of nausea and stomach pain started about 15 hours after the vaccine.

She was diagnosed with appendicitis after running some tests on 02May2021 and had her appendix has been removed on the same day she was admitted. The reporter asked if there was any further information about more patients getting appendicitis after the Pfizer vaccine and if the patient should get the second shot. One of her daughter&#39;s friends knew someone else who got the shot and got appendicitis, so the reporter wanted to know if it was a common side effect or coincidence. The reporter has no identifying information about her daughter&#39;s friend who knew someone that got the shot and had appendicitis. No additional vaccines administered on same date of the Pfizer suspect. They knew from the blood test something was wrong, the patient&#39;s WBC results were too high on 02May2021. The regular range was between 4.31-10.16 but the result was 22.03 units per microliter, she was not sure what the units mean. The patient&#39;s urine test results (unknown results) were not explained to the reporter and the CAT scan confirmed positive for appendicitis on 02May2021.  No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. The patient was recuperating from it with no more complications. The events require emergency room visit. The patient was recovering from the events.  The events were assessed as serious (hospitalization from 02May2021 to 03May2021)  Information on lot/batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

The client?s eyelids were open halfway, and the client was mumbling answers to the questions. The client stated, ?I feel dizzy and hot under my skin.? Vital signs were taken by EMT at 1901 (Heart rate 92, Oxygen 99%, blood pressure 112/P?client was wearing a long-sleeved shirt). Client?s skin was warm and dry.

EMS medic stated that her blood glucose levels were at 82 and advised her that they wanted to take her to the emergency room to be examined. The client refused transport to the hospital and stated, ?I don?t want to go to the hospital, it?s so expensive.? Client continued to refuse transport and stated that she will have her boyfriend take her to the hospital. Client?s boyfriend entered the building and client signed an AMA at 1953.

                                                My daughter was fine on the first day.  She woke up the next day with a weird headache that her scalp hurt.  She went into work and started to feel poorly throughout the day.  When she came home, she went to bed at 4:30 pm as she had aches &amp; pains, continued headache, felt nauseous, tired, and noticed her left leg where she had surgery previously was bothering her with pins and needles. I told her to go to bed and she would be fine the next day. On 5/26, her leg was giving her increased problems where she could not flex her foot, nerve pain in her leg along with numbness, and she still had the headache. I told her to call her primary care physician and the nurse had her go the the ER.  They ran no tests, but consulted with neuro on call and surgeon who performed surgery on her leg two years ago.  She was instructed to follow-up with a neuro and start PT.  We got her into a PT. The next day she continued to have same issues, but her leg pain increased.  She followed up via phone twice to primary where the nurse told her to go back to the ER. She had blood work, ultra sound and x-ray.  She saw neurologist on  6/2 and is scheduled for follow-up with an EMG on 6/14.  She has seen physical therapist 6x since 5/26 and still has numbness, nerve pain, etc.  The form from neuro office said left foot drop and parathesia. She has had headaches this week including a migraine on 6/8.

                                                Pfizer COVID vaccine administered 04/27/21. Reports that she started feeling unwell almost immediately after injection.  Immediate Reaction (onset &lt;5 min) associated with the following symptoms:  ? Visible swelling and pain at the injection site  ? Increased nasal secretions and eye tearing ? Chills Around 30 minutes after, she had also developed: ? Swelling of the tongue (felt &#34;heavy&#34;) ? Flushing, diaphoresis, and nausea, followed later by vomiting ? Dizziness/lightheadedness/weakness ? Dyspnea, wheezing, and cough ? Hives on arms and chest    No throat tightening or tachypnea. She did not attempt speech.  No one in the clinic took her blood pressure or pulse ox   The patient brought her epi pen with her but elected not to use it. Left after 30 minute observation period.  Thinks that the people at the vaccine clinic did not recognize that she had hives because of her dark complexion.  The people administering vaccines were not medically trained    Patient&#39;s mom recognized that she was not feeling well when she picked her up.  She took benadryl which helped with allergy symptoms.  She then developed fever up to 102.3, chills, headache, nausea, and myalgias x 5 days

                                                Received the shot at 2:10.  2:15, she was feeling light headed and tingly sensation in her extremities. She didn&#39;t let anyone know at this time.  The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

                                                Part one: Within one minute of injection, I was extremely dizzy and had to force myself to breathe. My hearing became muffled and I couldn&#39;t hear. I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

                                                Roughly 12 hours after I recieved my second dose of the vaccine (around 11:00 PM on 3/26) I started to develop a fever, headache, and chills. These symptoms lasted throughout the night into the morning. In the morning on Saturday (3/27), and for most of the day I felt fatigued and slightly nauseous. At 5:00 PM that night, I was walking in the hall of my residence when I experienced a syncopal episode, which has never happened to me before. I fainted several times and my roommate brought me to the ER. Other than low BP, my EKG and other vitals looked fine, and the doctor sent me home with the conclusion it was likley related to the vaccine. The next day, Sunday 3/28, I felt naseua and dizziness all day.

My stomach has been cramping nonstop and symptoms are still not gone over 5 days after receiving the vaccine. I?m worried about long term effects and how the second dose will react in my body. My symptoms were so severe I almost went to the ER but instead contacted my doctor who said they can?t do anything, and I need to ?ride it out?. I can?t eat anything without feeling extremely sick, and the nausea when it comes lasts up to 12 hours until my next meal.

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

                                                Full body aches starting the day after i received the vaccine. The next day the body soreness was severe enough to where it was painful to clench my fist or walk even a small distance. I also experienced nausea, loss of appetite, migraines and light sensitivity, and was unable to do normal tasks around the house for about 3-4 days. The full body soreness was the most debilitating symptom and certain aresa like elbows, knees, wrists and hips were painful to the touch. I think my joints were most affected. The soreness and pain can be compared to a flu but it was more intense than anything i have experienced before.

This is something that happens sometimes with my health issues. I think the second dose triggered my medical conditions and made me symptomatic. I haven?t had that happen in close to a year. Woke up around 11am on 4/21 with a bad headache, body pain, a sore arm, and feeling fatigued. Had to lay in bed until about 3pm when I finally started to feel a bit better.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

                                                syncopal episode; dry mouth; chills; nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable other health professional (patient). A 20-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose on 12Jan2021 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), second dose on 02Feb2021 14:30 (Batch/Lot number was not reported), both via an unspecified route of administration administered in left arm, at 20-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. The patient was not patient diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient experienced dry mouth, syncopal episode, chills, nausea on an unspecified date. The events did not result in emergency room visit or physician office visit. No treatment was received for the events. Since the vaccination, the patient has been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current limited available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be totally excluded/assessed.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

On 5/21/21 at 1723, the patient reported to our urgent care facility with a chief complaint of chest tightness (hurts when laying down), difficulty breathing, and nausea since the evening of 5/20/21. Given a recent Nexplanon insertion the day prior (5/20/21), the provider had a concern for possible PE so the patient was referred to the Emergency Department.  The patient arrived at the ED and was seen by the provider on 5/22/21 at 0416.  The patient continued to report chest discomfort as a heaviness, squeezing, ache.  The pain was constant and worse upon taking a deep breath.  Following a review of labs, EKG, Troponin, physical exam, the ED provider diagnoses &#39;chest wall pain&#39; and the patient was discharged home with instructions to f/u as an outpatient for any ongoing symptoms.  No additional chart documentation as of this report date (5/25/21).

                                                Immediately after receiving the Pfizer injection, I began to feel lightheaded and dizzy. Moments after that, I felt a general sense of unease and began feeling too hot. I was nauseated, sweating, shaking, experienced tingling in the hands and feet, tunnel vision, and temporary loss of hearing. Within 10 minutes, these had all subsided, and after my 15 minutes of waiting was up, I was allowed to leave with no further adverse reactions.

However when I got the Covid vaccine my Dysmenorrhea returned. I vomited and had severe cramping. My cramping used to be two days. On Norethindrone I had no cramps or vomiting, I didn&#39;t even have a flow during my menstrual cycle anymore. After the vaccine, I vomited, had cramps for 4 or 5 days, (so worse than before). I have continued to have spotty breakthrough  bleeding on and off for three weeks, which is much longer than it has ever been.  I&#39;m concerned about what will happen with the second dose of the vaccine.

A 20-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: solution for injection, lot number: EW0191; Expiration Date: Sep2021), via an unspecified route of administration, in Left arm on 22May2021 at 11:30 (at the age of 20-years) as single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing acid reflux in the stomach; was diagnosed about one or two years ago. The patient did not receive any vaccinations within 4 weeks prior to the administration of suspect vaccine. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications included ongoing Tri-lo-sprintec (started taking it to regulate her cycle as she had an irregular period; she started this birth control 2 or 3 years ago). On 22May2021, the patient waited 15 minutes after the shot and felt fine, but later on that day (a couple of hours after) she got chills (about three hours after the vaccine). She stated she had normal side effects and did not think anything of it. On Sunday (23May2021), she had difficulty breathing (trouble breathing) and felt weak (feeling very weak and has no energy). She voiced it&#39;s hard for her to wear a mask. When she had to put a mask on it really felt like she could not breathe, and the air feels stuffy especially if she wears a mask; every couple of seconds she had to wear the mask under her nose because she could not breathe. Caller stated that she did not have this problem before receiving the COVID vaccine. On Monday (24May2021), she felt like she was coming down with a cold. Caller stated that she thought that might be her trouble breathing was from her cold-like symptoms, but she does not think it was, because she was not experiencing any cold-like symptoms on Sunday and was only having trouble breathing. She experienced coughing, sneezing, itching eyes/nose, chills, and headache. On Wednesday (26May2021), she started feeling nauseated (got very nauseous), not feeling good, she was getting a headache and had caught a cold. Caller stated she did not know if it was from vaccine shot but her eyes got itchy, her nose got itchy, and she kept sneezing and coughing. Yesterday (26May2021), the chills went away, she has not had any chills today, but she does not know if she will have any from this point on. She believed that she has recovered with lasting effects. Caller stated that not feeling well was ongoing and persisting, but then stated that she feels it was worsening. Yesterday, she just felt nauseous, today she woke up with her stomach hurting very badly and abdominal pain; her weakness has continued. Yesterday she took pantoprazole for the abdominal pain and Tylenol for the pain and headache. She stated that she had a slight headache that is now coming and going, clarifies that it is persisting. Caller thought the reason that her stomach is hurting was because of her stomach acid problem. She deals with a strict diet that she must follow for things she was not supposed to have. Since she had the COVID shot, she believes it was affecting the acid problems in her stomach. Caller clarified that she was calling to see what she should do, if she should go see a doctor or if this is normal. The outcome of events Dyspnoea, Asthenia, Sneezing, Headache, stomach hurting, Itchy was not resolved. The outcome of events of Nausea, started not feeling good, Cold like symptoms was resolving. The outcome of events chills was resolved with sequel on 26May2021, and Cough resolved with sequel on 25May2021. The outcome of Abdominal pain was unknown.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                5 mins post 1st dose vaccination patient began feeling nauseous, throat felt tight with mild pain when swallowing, tingling sensation from the chest down to her toes, facial flushing, and dizziness. She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins. Patient was monitored for over 45 mins. She was instructed to contact her PCP and her allergist to be cleared for her second vaccine dose. She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

She said she didn&#39;t feel well, and she didn&#39;t want lunch. Then she went and vomited. We took her temperature, and it was normal. We talked to her, made sure she was oriented. She then had a bout of diarrhea in the bathroom. It took about an hour for her color to completely come back and for her to feel better. She called Pfizer and spoke to them to make a report. They told her they have not had reports like this a few days after the vaccine was given. We were not sure if she should have the 2nd round or not.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

                                                Immediately, I had increased  heart rate - 194 - I fainted to the ground. I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

It felt like something was sitting on my chest. My lips and throat also got very itchy. I went over to a paramedic who gave me IV benadryl and something for nausea. My blood pressure and HR were initially high but lowered. My O2 was fine. Then I got really light headed and my tongue, throat, and whole face got more itchy. I then went to the ER and got epipen intramusclarly in the ambulance. At the hospital I got steroids and an IV bag. Around 3:30 I started to feel normal again. I stayed under observation for 4 hours. THen got discharged with a prescription of steroids.

                                                High fever, body aches, chills, nausea, and head ache. I went to bed Friday night after getting my vaccine Friday morning. I felt perfectly fine that night, but woke up at 2 am feeling all of those symptoms. I went back to bed shivering. I woke up again at around 4 am and took some Nyquil and drank a lot of water and was able to fall back asleep. I spent the rest of Saturday in and out of sleep with a low fever and feeling spacey and woke up Sunday feeling completely fine. I had COVID-19 in July and the symptoms I experienced in the early hours Saturday felt very similar.

These symptoms included severe nausea, headache, weak/rapid heart rate, chills, muscle aches, and a fever of 101 degrees F.  Lymph nodes in the left armpit were also swollen and painful to the touch. After 10am, the chills and fever subsided, but the headache, general muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and bouts of nausea persisted (these lasted the entire day). The following day (4/23),  nausea and muscle aches subsided but the headache remained. The headache only came on whenever changing elevation of the head (standing up, sitting down, bending over), at which point it would be painful for a few minutes after moving. An extremely stiff, painful neck also began the same day (4/23) and persisted for approximately 2 days after injection (accompanied by the headache). Lymph nodes under the collar bone on the left side of the body also became swollen (4/23). Lymph nodes in armpit and under collarbone are still swollen 6 days after injection, although not painful.

About 1 minute later, the patient&#39;s brother called for help while we were filling up a cup of water for her. At this time she became unresponsive and head rolled back in chair. Appeared clammy and possible swelling in the face. Pharmacist went to prepare Epi-Pen, but patient became responsive again (about 15 seconds later) before pharmacist could administer. 911 was called by technician at first sign of unresponsiveness. EMT arrived and questioned patient, at which time she was talking quietly and still nauseous. She was hauled out on a stretcher and taken care of by emergency personnel. Unknown status after that.

This lasted throughout the night (lasted 24 hours after vaccine administration). I had a lot of trouble sleeping due to the pain and temperature fluctuations (I would wake up hot and sweating, then an hour later cold and shivering, multiple times throughout the night). I treated the symptoms with Acetaminophen 500mg throughout the evening and the day after. The day after (24 hours later), I was fatigued and had stomach pains, with not much of an appetite.

Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

A 22-years-old non-pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BIONTECH Covid-19 Vaccine) Lot number=EL9262, via an unspecified route of administration in left arm,  on 25Jan2021 at 09:00 ( at the age of 22) as a single dose  for covid-19 immunisation.   There were no other vaccinations within 4 weeks. Medical history included Asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and insomnia.  Concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel (DAYSEE).

It was unknown if the patient tested for COVID-19 post-vaccination.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.

This non-pregnant 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Feb2021 at 09:45 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression and anxiety, both from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no allergies to medication, food or other products, and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included duloxetine from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LARIN FE) from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ibuprofen from an unknown date for an unknown indication; and acetaminophen from an unknown date for an unknown indication. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported, it first started as a headache and extreme fatigue about two hours after the vaccine. She took two ibuprofen and felt better for a few hours, but the fatigue kept growing and then she started to get cold sweats and chills. The day after was the worse. She had fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain and fatigue, pain at the injection site, and congestion. She took acetaminophen through-out the day and couldn&#39;t eat much. The second day the fever and cold sweats went away but she still had intense nausea. It was the third day (as of 10Feb2021) and she felt better but still had fatigue and minor nausea. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. The clinical outcomes of headache, extreme fatigue, cold sweat, chills, fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain, congestion, couldn&#39;t eat much and pain at the injection site were reported as recovering. It was also reported that since vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                On the evening of my vaccine my left arm became swollen and painful. I then became nauseous, had a high fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and suffered from a migraine in the front sinus cavity all night. The next morning of the 27th my symptoms persisted, now accompanied by body aches, specifically my hip flexers were very sore and I was exhausted all day. by the morning of the 28th all symptoms subsided.

                                                The first night, I had very bad nausea - and that went into all the next day. After that - upper respiratory  symptoms- cough, nasal congestion, sore throat - Tuesday - Saturday after the vaccine. I had a very sore arm - couldn&#39;t lift my arm up for about four days. Advil - cold and flu for symptoms. It helped manage the symptoms.  I went on an antibiotic for the respiratory symptoms - I had contacted my doctor and they prescribed it.

Later that night I felt sick to my stomach and experienced diarrhea. The next day I was nauseous and began vomiting for two days with continuous chills, hot flashes, diarrhea and headaches. The following day I stopped vomiting but continued to have chills, hot flashes and diarrhea. A week after the injection, I am finally feeling some relief.

                                                I received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at 9:15 AM on March 9, 2021.  I then returned to work. At about 4:30 PM on that same day, I started feeling dizzy. I felt like I was going to faint at work. Every time I would stand up, I would feel like I was going to pass out.  I had someone drive me home because I felt that I was too dizzy to drive. I arrived home at 6:00 PM and began to vomit profusely. I threw up all night and had the chills.  In the morning, I felt better but still had a dizzy feeling. The dizziness and vomiting completely  subsided by March 11,  2021.    On March  12, 2021, I noticed that I had floating black spots in my left eye accompanied by a painful migraine. I have never had eye floaters or migraines previous to this vaccine. My migraine lasted for 5 days straight and I had to be off work to go to the emergency  room because I started to loose vision in my left eye. They were unsure of the cause because I did not have any pre-existing health conditions.  The migraine finally subsided after the 7th day. I have had eye floaters every since I got the vaccine. I?ve been to an eye doctor and my primary and they all have told me that it could be from this vaccine because I have never had the problem until I received it.

Throat started to close and feel tight like I could not breathe. Tongue swelled and could not feel tongue while biting down. Chest compression on center chest. Around 1:30 PM I told sister to get a nurse and the nurse said due to my allergic reaction I needed to do the EpiPen.  She administered properly in my thigh. About 1:35 PM, symptoms started to go away. Stayed until 1:45 PM and when I left I told the nurse I was leaving. Took 2 Benadryl pills in my car with water.

                                                March 5, 2021: 1st dose of Pfizer vaccine. Severe site pain.  March 23, 2021: 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine. Felt very restless and sick during night, by the next morning symptoms really sat in.  March 24, 2021: Went to Urgent Care due to fever. Had COVID-19 test (negative). Very close to passing out there (put head between knees and did not). Was sent to emergency room immediately due to heart rate (high 140s-150s. Highest known was 152 BPM). ER performed following: portable chest x-ray, blood tests, urine tests, EKG. Was told results were all normal with the exception of EKG (not told anything about it, form listed as abnormal). Passed out 2x at hospital. Was given one IV rehydration solution and released that night. Symptoms below lasted for several days: Headache Aches Nausea Aggressive shakes Shortness of breath Confusion Dizziness Site pain (also developed bump under arm) Fever - 103.8 (after 2 Advil, 2 Tylenol, 3 ice packs and eating frozen grapes) Heavy sweats Racing heart Restless  March 30, 2021: Still having frequent heart palpitations (they come and go but happen several times during the day. Keep having very high heart rates). Went to doctor. While there, nurse noted irregular heartbeat that sounded like it was ?skipping a beat? and heart rate was also jumping all over the place (high pace, low pace, high, etc.). It was clear something was abnormal. Doctor gave EKG approximately 20 minutes later, EKG looked normal. Was told to come back next morning for blood work and to cut out caffeine.  March 31, 2021: Came in for blood work to check thyroid.  April 6, 2021: Thyroid results were normal. Still having palpitations among other symptoms (see April 12 for more info) so was told to come in. Was given ?work from home? note and referred to cardiologist.  April 12, 2021: Appointment at cardiologist. Still having severe palpitations, occasional dizziness/ lightheadedness, nausea, shortness of breath, exhaustion and chest pain. Heart rate was recorded this day to have gotten up to 139 BPM-- was very high majority of the day. EKG was normal (with exception of high heart rate) but 30 mins later doctor observed high heart rate and abnormal rhythm. Was told to come back in a week and one day for a heart ultrasound and heart monitoring for three days. Still no caffeine intake since 3/30/21. Previous heart rates taken at doctor&#39;s visits over the years for comparison below. Never had any prior heart problems whatsoever:  8/29/18: 70 BPM 9/17/18: 88 BPM 10/17/18: 64 BPM 10/31/18: 73 BPM 1/21/19: 78 BPM Note: At this point, I have missed over a  week and a half of work, and worked from home for over a week. I&#39;m not any better heart wise at all over the course of three weeks post vaccine.

At about 4 AM I was going to the bathroom and then felt about to puke again. I then began to get tinnitus in both my ears and my left eye went black and I thought I was going to pass out. I laid on the bathroom floor for another 30 minutes before going back to sleep. Other symptoms that started on 4/18/21 included chills and fever which lasted until about 6 AM on 4/19/21.

                                                Chills and hot flashes starting 5pm(estimated) April 12th and continuing until April 18th. No temperature measured except the 16th when temperature fluctuations measured between 94-98 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day (fluctuating fairly quickly with multiple degree differences within minutes of each other, thermometer was correct when compared with a second thermometer&#39;s readings)  Migraines all day Tuesday (13th of April) and Wednesday (14th of April) with severe nausea worsening at night, stayed laying or sitting down to keep from throwing up. Period (menstruation) started this day as well, and bleeding was heavier than normal with severe cramps which I never experience. Migraines are also never experienced as a symptom of menstruation. Migraines continued until Monday April 19th but were much lighter and without nausea or stomach cramping. Period ends today (April 21rst), the blood having been heavy the entire time.   Outcome: I am still getting headaches but nothing as severe as before and am able to go about normal life again.   Treatment: Did not see any professionals for symptoms. Took Ibuprofen for pain on Saturday and Sunday (and avoided pain killers at all before that for fear of that possibly being dangerous and complicating things if my condition had worsened and I needed to seek medical care). Saturday and Sunday I only took 1 dose each day. I did take coffee to try to help with the migraines Saturday and Sunday as well and that with the Ibuprofen helped a little bit.

                                                Around 12 hours after the shot, I took Tylenol for body aches and fever. I woke around 3:30 am to shaking and stomach pains then fell back asleep. I woke up again around 5:15 am to intense involuntary shaking. My family members wrapped me in blankets and applied pressure to my body until the shaking stopped. Within the next 40 minutes I vomited and had diarrhea. At the time also had body aches, chills, fever, and mild swelling of various areas if the body. I slept most of the morning and ate lunch around 1:30 pm. I took Tylenol again at 2:00 pm with the symptoms lessening over the next 5-6 hours. After that fever, chills, and body aches returned.

When I woke up the next morning, I had continual arm pain, severe chills, nausea, exhaustion, and a headache. These symptoms were reduced with 800mg of acetaminophen every 4-6 hours. The symptoms started to get better at around 9:00pm. The following morning, all symptoms were gone except for a very mild discomfort in my shoulder where the shot was.

Had to be transported to ER via ambulance. Vomiting occurred for several hours. Was given Tylenol, Benadryl, zofran, imotrex, Valium, and fluids via IV. Sympoms continued for 8 hrs. 12 days later symptoms are still ongoing.

In the morning, the feeling was still there and it worried me so I went to  Urgent Care, but they just told me to monitor my symptoms and make sure that I don&#39;t start to feel weak. It persisted through the day. The next morning I woke up and it was mostly just on my right side in the leg, feet, hands and arms. Around 9:00 AM the right side of my face began to go tingling-- felt like I had Novacane injection. No pain. Because of my anxiety, throughout the day I got nauseous and warm, but never had a fever or anything like that. Been drinking lots of fluids.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of the bnt162b2 (BNT162B2; Lot Number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 15Jan2021 at 09:00 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient received the immunization in a hospital. Medical history included Ehlers-Danlos, allergic asthma, and fracture. Concomitant medication included drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (NIKKI) for birth control. There were no other vaccines given in four weeks. The patient previously took tramadol (MANUFACTURER UNKNOWN) and experienced allergies. On 28Jan2021 at 11:00, the patient experienced right sided numbness, severe headache, and nausea, which were serious for disability. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events. The patient was treated in the emergency room and sent home with TIA protocol to follow with neurologist. There was no COVID prior or post vaccination. The clinical outcome of the events was not recovered.   No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available the causal association between the reported events right sided numbness, severe headache, and nausea and the usage of the vaccine BNT162B2 cannot be excluded but also the contributory role of the concomitant medications/medical history of the patient need to be taken into consideration. The case will be reassessed should the additional information be available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.  Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The vomiting,  being dizzy and sleeping continued for days.  Went to Urgent Care on April 20, 2021.  They gave me nausea medicine and said I should expect to feel this way for about one week.  The nausea medicine helped with the vomiting, but did not help with being dizzy and sleepy.  Making a trip to the ER for more answers.

                                                I have been feeling very lightheaded and dizzy ever since. This occurs every day.  I cannot drink caffeine anymore because I get extra dizzy. My balance is off. I got my heart checked in which I had to wear a heart monitor and get an echo. It came back and nothing is wrong with my heart. I also cannot take a deep breath. I always have shortness of breath. I had three episodes in which I thought I was actually going to pass out and my arms and legs were tingly and I was nauseated. I went to the emergency room and nothing came back from my labs. I am lightheaded when I get up fast. I no longer have nausea and appendages tingle.  All of this occurred on the first dose and I did not receive the second dose.

The patient has no medical history. Concomitant medication includes unspecified birth control pills. The patient reported that she got the vaccine this morning and about maybe 30-45 min after getting the vaccine, she started being nauseous and vomiting. She doesn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor. She vomited 15 minutes ago. She has vomited 2-3 times in the last hour. She is trying to drink sprite and crackers to settle her stomach, but it is still there. She is not taking any other medication. She does take birth control but doesn&#39;t think it is pertinent. She is calling to see what she should do for symptom management and how long these side effects will last for. She mentioned that vomiting started after nausea. The patient reported that her employer does not believe she is having side effects. The outcome of the events was not recovered.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color.

Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

                                                After around 12 hours from getting my vaccine, I experienced strong aches, mild fever, and headaches. Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia. Symptoms became more mild at hour 31 post vaccine. I had a swollen lymph node after the first vaccine above my left collarbone (injected on left side) and still have this, and now I have a swollen armpit that is very painful on my right side (injected on the right side).

The following day 1/08/21 I still had a sore throat I was able to eat , but at the end of the night I got a fever me temperature was 102.0 . I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

I experienced several side effects that day: lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, nausea, throat constriction leading to shortness of breath and difficulty in swallowing, hives, flushed face, and fatigue. The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                So I received the vaccine on my left arm on January 20th and the next day I had swelling on my left arm and neck. It went away within an hour or so. However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

Could not complete anything that required any type of focus such as watch TV/go on phone, the light increased headache. Slept on and off all day. Evening (1/26; 4:30pm): Took Excedrin for headache, was told by other coworkers not to medicate until 24 hours after at least, so did not take anything up to this point just in case. Slept another 2 hours, woke up extremely sweaty, fever had broken to 99.1, and headache was gone.

                                                On 2/10/2021, two days after my 2nd dose, I started experiencing mild abdominal pain at around 10am. I knew it was a side effect from the vaccine for I had been experiencing severe chills, fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea the day before (2/9/2021) and those symptoms except for the fever had subsided on the 10th. I had been unable to eat all day on the 10th due to the pain but it was manageable. At 2pm the abdominal pain got worse. At 4:30pm the pain became unmanageable and I could not walk erect without severe pain. I was crying and bend over trying to walk. I had a family member drive me to the ER and arrived at around 4:40pm.  Lying down with my knees up seemed to help the pain a bit but was exacerbated when lying flat or ambulating. I was given Pepcid, zofran,  and toradol all IV push  at 8pm and the pain subsided within 15 minutes. Today I still have mild abdominal pain but I would rate it at a 1/10.

Day after the vaccine, pt woke up with a low-grade fever, fatigue, and full-body weakness, and nausea. Pt admits to sleeping for the majority of the day. No pain reliever or fever reducers were taken. After 26 hours post vaccine, fatigue lessened but low-grade fever and weakness persisted.

I had to go to the hospital, where I received fluids and other treatments from Saturday to Wednesday. I developed more nausea and diarrhea in the hospital the last two days I was there, which were attributed to a stomach bug that had been going around in my home.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

                                                I received the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday, Monday December 21, at 0700. Last evening I was up all night with fairly severe symptoms, including a severe migraine unrelieved by pain medication, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and a low grade fever. I felt unsafe to return to work today and called out due to my fever.

                                                Within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine I felt extremely lightheaded, eyes were blurry for 5-10 minutes, and extreme sweating all over my body. These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

Uncertain about time of loss of consciousness. Other symptoms included pallor, fast heart rate, sweating, nausea and loss of bladder function.

Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

Nausea, dizziness, haziness, and headache were on and off the rest of the day, subsiding around 6 PM.

After 10-15 minutes the tingling subsided into shivering, but I did not feel cold. The shivering went away about 15 minutes later. 30 minutes after that, the same pattern and duration of tingling and shivering happened again. The next day (about 24 hours after vaccination) I felt very nauseous and had a bad headache that lasted about 4 hours.

                                                The patient was sitting for their 15 minute observation time  and about 5 minutes after the patient&#39;s vaccination the patient was holding her head and tilting forward. I came over to ask if the patient was ok. The patient said they felt unwell and needed to vomit. The patient proceeded to vomit several times in a garbage can. The patient and their mother were sent to the back of the store near the bathroom to be observed for further symptoms. Patient and mother stated no need to call 911. After about 20 minutes the patient felt well enough to try to home. I escorted the patient and their mother out of the store when the patient felt ok.  The Vaccine Administration Record(VAR) form filled out by the patient did not state that they had felt dizziness or fainting from any vaccine previously. Upon questioning the patient after vomiting  the patient stated she had dizziness/fainted and vomited before after blood draws. However, the patient has not gotten any recent vaccinations and no such adverse reactions took place before.

When I arrived patient was laying down on a chair with a friend, shaking with seizure like activity but alert and oriented to person place and time. Upon my arrival she was shaking, vomited x 1 and then complained about chest pain.   Vitals upon my arrival: HR 58, o2 100% RR appeared to be around 22-24 (hyperventilating) BP 88 systolic (manual)--repeated by medics upon arrival minutes later 110/72.   Given throat closing sensation, vomiting, shortness of breath I advised to call 911 and ordered Epinephrine x 1 which was given by RN immediately. Pt was then placed on the grown chin up, she continued to shake throughout entire body but continued to be alert and oriented. Medics then arrived on seen, started an IV, glucose by medics 84, IVF started by medics. Pt was transported to ER via medics.   Pt is not a patient, last visit 2017.

Prior to transport to ER pt continued to be alert oriented, but shaking and twitching throughout her body. MD verbally communicated to patient to not receive the 2nd dose given her severe anaphylaxis like reaction to the first dose of the vaccine. Pt can be referred to allergist after ER follow up by PCP.  Denied pregnancy.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

Took ibuprofen 400mg which helped my fever go down for awhile and went to take a nap in the afternoon. Woke up from the nap in the evening around 6pm with a 102.9 fever, increased aches, pains and I ended up vomiting once. My appetite was suppressed (barely ate any food that day) and proceeded to take a  Tylenol 500mg before going to bed at 9pm. Woke up the next day, 4/17/21, with my fever gone and the only lingering side affects were fatigue and a headache. Woke up today, 4/18/21, feeling normal again.

It felt like things were moving in slow motion, frame by frame, when I woke up at 3am. Was light headed, couldn&#39;t stand, chills and shaking. I vomited from 3-4 am and then again at 8am when I woke up, with my visual disturbances limited to the 3-4am hours. I took Advil and was able to go back to sleep for most of the day, sleeping from around 9am to 1pm. Nausea, fever, and vomiting have all have cleared. Now I just have a headache and muscle aches, especially near the injection site. Almost 24 hrs after my vaccine now and I feel drastically better than I did overnight.

SHE SAT FOR THE ENTIRE TIME AND WENT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. I INSTRUCTED THE PATIENT TO  CONSUME A SPRITE TO  HELP SETTLE HER STOMACH AND TO EAT A LIGHT SNACK. AFTERWARDS, THE PATIENT AND HER FAMILY LEFT THE PREMISES.

The night of getting the first shot I barely slept because I had chills all night long &amp; my entire body was so sore it hurt to lay in any position. In the morning, I still had extreme muscle pain all over. I was extremely light headed &amp; dizzy, I had a throbbing headache so I  took 2 aleve pills. I was getting super nauseous and almost passed out while trying to get to my bathroom just in time to throw up only water. Just before throwing up my vision went fuzzy,  my ears were ringing, I was dripping sweat, it was getting hard to breathe, &amp; my hands were shaking.  After taking a cold shower, laying down, &amp; drinking some water I feel a bit better but not 100% normal.

Pt stated that she had some &#34;chest tightness&#34; shortly after the first dose (~4/24/21). After reviewing VAR filled out by patient today, I consulted with pt about having a reaction to the first dose.  Pt stated that EMS observed her for 30 minutes after the 1st vaccination and patient self-reports that she recovered without the use of an epi pen (pt does carry an epipen on her at all times) within that 30 minute window and was allowed to leave.  We administered 2nd dose with the understanding that patient recovered from 1st dose with no breathing difficulties or swelling of tongue or throat (just chest tightness as reported by pt).   After administering the second dose today, Pt began to show signs of an allergic reaction ~ 5 minutes after administration  and we administered the epi-pen and  911 was called.  Observed that pt vomited and complained of chest tightness, tight throat , difficulty breathing and being hot and &#34;sleepy&#34; after second shot.  Pt appeared to be alert and oriented and was sitting in a chair.  EMS arrived and pt is now under their care.  We dont know the lot number of the 1st covid vaccination but the lot used today was EW0167 with an expiration of 8/31/21.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

Slept for 10-12 hours. Woke up fine, had no issues or symptoms. Later on as the day progressed, around noon-1pm, I noticed I had started to get a headache and some dizziness. Daily headaches and vertigo are normal for me, currently seeing a neurologist for this, but I realized that this was getting worse from the daily headaches and vertigo that affects me. Took 2 Excedrin extra strength migraine relief to no relief.

I have not experienced more than a half hour without any pain. It has been ongoing since 1/13/21. I woke up last night at 2:45am with a throbbing pain on the left side of my chest.

Then it felt like the world was swaying like I was underwater and colors looked really bright, i felt really dizzy. I laid down on the couch and waited a couple minutes till everything was kind of normal. I still feel nauseous but the dizziness is almost gone.

I took Tylenol twice that day and felt a small amount of relief. I woke up the following day, 2 days after the vaccine, still feeling nauseous, had a headache, temperature 100.4, fatigue, and body aches. I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. 3 days following the vaccine I am still having nausea with vomiting, body aches, and fatigue, my temperature day 3 is 100.1. I had to call into work because of my symptoms and the screening tool used to get into work flagged me.

The most intense headache of my life. I also got an intense stomachache and it felt like I had an ulcer. That progressed to a low grade fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The myalgia and arthralgia were so intense that moving to stretch my legs was incredibly painful. I was also very nauseous. The intensity of the arthralgia and myalgia subsided around 8am on 02/01/2021. All my other symptoms continued until around 11am on 2/2/2021. I still have a headache and some muscle pain, but they are manageable.

                                                I had several adverse side effects from the vaccine (which I was expecting given it was my second dose). I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

I went to bed around 9 pm and had some chills and mild body aches so I took some Tylenol. I woke up around 12pm with sore muscles and cramps/aches in my back, hips, legs, and neck. I also had a mild fever of 100.7 and was nauseous. I took some Zofran for nausea. I had chills and was flushed and sweating. That next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was very fatigued, had little to no appetite, and had a pounding headache. I slept the entire day 1/25. The following day 1/26 I felt better but still groggy, I slept the majority of the day before heading off to work.

A 24-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 11:30 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema and known allergies: NSAIDs, &#34;no gas,&#34; eggs, gluten, dairy. Concomitant medications in two weeks included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), magnesium, and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Dec2020. She did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient reported &#34;I had my second injection at 11:30 on 18Jan2021. By 20:00, I was feeling fatigued and at 23:00, I got the chills and a fever and severe body aches radiating from the left side of my body. These lasted until around 23:00 on 19Jan2021 with a maximum temperature of 100.8. When I woke up on 20Jan2021, I felt fine, no fever, very mild body aches. Around 16:00, I began to feel fatigued again, and at 20:00 I felt I was coming down with a head cold (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, sore throat). At 23:00, I started violently vomiting and I vomited 10-12 times over the next 8 hours. I also spiked a fever of 102.6. I was prescribed ondansetron (ZOFRAN) on 21Jan2021, which kept the vomiting at bay and on 22Jan2021, I had a negative saliva test for COVID. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit.

                                                Diarrhea and Cramping : I felt fine on Friday I was doing well. My arm was sore but over the course of Saturday it started to go away. The one thing that I have been clocking is diarrhea. I would have a cramping cramping feeling in my stomach on my left side it would feel like it?s coming from my uterus. I had first thought it was because I was in a sitting position and the 90° angle wasn?t great for my body and so I thought I just had to leave straight because even as I?m talking this right now like I feel a little bit of cramping sitting in a 90° angle. But the diarrhea is still ongoing it?s been waking me up at five almost 6 AM and I woken up at least three times in the middle of the night going into Sunday. I was actually fine during the whole entire day of Saturday because I was able to like be on a long meeting call but after that was done my body just needed to expel things. I did eat a tiny bit while I was in a meeting I ate cake   chocolate, A bunch of sweets. Also after I?ve woken up right now at 6 AM I drink some water and the water felt like it was sitting in the top of my stomach and I have to slowly very very slowly go down not in my esophagus in my throat in my stomach like it bloated me and as I was walking around it slowly went away I am trying to drink a lot of water because I?m conscious that I?m having diarrhea.   Is the diarrhea an an allergic reaction? Is the diarrhea a reaction to an active ingredient in the vaccine? (polyethylene glycol)

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

I was nauseous, achey, fatigued, and shivering all morning. I had a temperature of 99.4 degrees. Between 11am-1pm on Saturday 02/27, I vomited three times. I had a horrible headache, stomach ache, and felt achey, cold, and weak all day. On Sunday, 02/28, my fever resided, and I did not vomit but still had stomach aches and slight nausea. I had eaten nothing out of the ordinary on Friday (made pizza at home like I do every Friday), and there were no other abnormalities during the day.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I was lightheaded, nauseated and my tongue began to get itchy and swollen like the beginning of an anaphylactic reaction. I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

I went to my kitchen to get water and passed out, dropping the glass I was in the process of getting from the cabinet, and I crashed. I felt so horrible I just tried to get back to my bed at that point without getting water. I passed out again trying to get back to my bed, bruising my right knee and my ribs.  One the most horrible feelings I have experienced. I stayed on the floor for a bit recovering the second spell. My sister heard the commotion and quickly brought me water and Tylenol.  My head felt full of pressure that I couldn?t get rid of by holding my nose and blowing. Eventually that went away. I stayed in bed for the rest of the day drinking water and Gatorade. I felt like I had an intense flu for the remainder of the day with chills and fever. The following day I needed more sleep but felt better.  Now today, Saturday I feel better, but I still feel shocked at how intense my body?s reaction was to the second dose.

                                                4/4: Woke up Easter Sunday with the following symptoms: sweats, chills, uncontrollable shaking, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Went to Urgent Care, but it was closed for the holiday, so instead went to ER. See Item 19 for details. I was discharged within an hour because there was nothing seriously wrong with me, doctor wrote it off as a stomach bug and ordered me to rest and hydrate.  4/4 - 4/10: Virtually every day for this week went the exact same. I would wake up between 6-7am, feel nauseous, weak, no appetite, and shaking. Walking around my apartment would leave me utterly exhausted. I would nap from 9am-12pm, then again from 2-4pm. Ate very little, drank water and sports drinks when awake. Breathing was still shaky. Occasional diarrhea.  4/10: Although slightly less ill than the previous 6 days, I still felt weak, shaky, and exhausted. I went back to Urgent Care this time, and the doctor examined me. She noted my left ear was very inflamed and suspected an ear infection. She prescribed me a week of amoxycilin and told me to rest and eat bland foods.  4/12: After 2 days on the antibiotics, some of my symptoms cleared. I was no longer shaking or having shortness of breath, and although still tired, I did not sleep for half the day as I had the previous week. My appetite was not fully there yet, and in the mornings of this week I would wake up feeling nauseous for about 2 hours. On this day 4/12 my period also started, which is unusual. It was not due to start until around April 17th. My period is very regular and light due to being on birth control, so I consider this abnormal. The flow was also very heavy.   4/17: Heavy flow of my period slows significantly and is now just a slight pink/brown color. I only need a liner to contain it. This is also my last day of antibiotics, so I buy a probiotic supplement in the hopes that it will help settle my gut.  4/17-present (4/20): The morning nausea and lack of appetite are still present despite being off the antibiotics. Occasional discomfort in abdomen/chest. Unexplained muscle soreness in hips, legs, back, and chest. My bowel movement schedule has also completely changed. Normally I do not experience a bowel movement until late morning, after 10am. But for the past 2 weeks I have been woken up around 5:30am with a sudden urge. At the beginning of my illness it was diarrhea but now it has transitioned to slightly more solid feces. It is not really diarrhea anymore.

                                                Received 2nd vaccine at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. Woke up in the early hours of Monday not feeling great, didn&#39;t sleep well. Woke up at 8am for work with extreme chills, aches and pains. Tried to get up to get water, was so nauseous and lightheaded, I felt like I was going to pass out. Could barely stand up straight. Walked back to room and collapsed onto bed. Dry heaved into a trash can for a few minutes, feeling like I was about to throw up. Did not throw up. Took 2 Tylenol layed in bed, unable to move as I was extremely dizzy, nauseous and generally unwell. Fever of 99.?? (I forget). Fell asleep and woke up 2 hours later feeling better. Tylenol wore off around 5pm. Extreme chills and body aches came back. Fever of 100.4. Did not want to eat but had a few pieces of bread. Went to bed like normal that night. Felt almost back to normal the next day, still a little nausea with low energy but no fevers.

Exactly a week after getting the shot, I woke up with a fever of 101.2. The night before, I was experiencing lower right back pain, thinking it was a pulled muscle, but the pain was still present in the morning and it was painful. The rest of the day I had chills, fatigue, fever, lower back pain,  and no appetite. The next day I experienced the same things, plus headache. I was able to control my fever wit Mortin. The 3rd day I woke up with pain in intestine area  as well in my back. I had realized that I had not pooped for several days and I feel that I might have been constipated. I was feeling better on that third day,  with on and off fevers and fatigue. The 4th day I only experienced a fever and it went away throughout the day which was promising. 5th day I woke up feeling great and completely normal. So I experienced Flu like symptoms, plus back and muscles aches and constipation. I took 2 extra strength tylenol everyday along with 1 Motrin and sudafed Claritin D. I drank lots of water and hot teas. 4 days till i felt better.

These symptoms have lasted for over seven weeks and are so bad to the point I cannot eat or sleep and have sought out emergency medical attention. In this same time period, I got what my doctors believe is Eosinophilic Esophagitis where my throat is now chronically inflamed, making it difficult to swallow. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings when I never had a history of this.  I have tried taking several medications and PPI&#39;s with no success as well as trying every type of diet and lifestyle change possible with no success. I have not recovered from this and expect it will be some time before I do.

Advil started to wear off at about 1:30. At that time, I became nauseous and a little dizzy. I ended up going home early from work because of it. That night, I had such intense pain around my midsection I could barely move and deep breaths such as a yawn hurt way more.

                                                developed slight nausea while walking about 14 hours after second dose and that quickly turned into loss of hearing and vision after standing still for a few minutes. Blacked out for about a minute and lost consciousness but was able to still stand either because I was holding onto something or someone was helping me (not sure).  Came to and was drenched in sweat and stomach was churning. Hearing and vision came back after a few minutes. About an hour later, full body chills and body aches.

The patient had an adverse reaction to the first of the two vaccine shot and wanted to know if she can get the second. She had pretty bad cold and flu symptoms and did have anaphylactic allergies, and swell up like her throat, neck and face swelled a little bit on 06May2021. It wasn&#39;t enough to go to the emergency room. She took Benadryl and kind of monitored but she thought her doctor would have called it like a pre-anaphylactic sort of reaction. The patient was having the reactions on yesterday (06May2021), still didn&#39;t feel good today (07May2021). She started to swell up she took Benadryl and Tylenol because she had slight fever it was 102 (06May2021). So, Tylenol 400 mg (took 2 pills), took 600 mg of Ibuprofen and the Benadryl 200 (200 but not entirely sure). She tried not to take medication unless have to, the moment she started throwing up she took the Benadryl only took that once, her arm was really killing her so she did take the Ibuprofen twice yesterday (06May2021) and twice Wednesday (05May2021). The fever came back yesterday (06May2021). Tylenol, probably the same twice on Wednesday, twice on Thursday, the patient hadn&#39;t had to take any today (07May2021). The outcome of events was not recovered.

                                                Fatigue and slight arm pain started about 3hrs after the shot, which was at 6pm. Around 3:30am, I woke up with a strong headache, arm pain, and some body aches. I had a mild fever of 100. Over the course of the morning (until 8:45am), fever became higher (until over 101), body aches increased, pain at injection site remained, and nausea appeared. Headache was receding somewhat. I took a 200mg Advil at 8:45am.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

                                                Around Midnight, the night following the second COVID-19 vaccine I started to become ill with feverish chills and nausea and puking. The nausea and puking went away a couple of hours after it started, so it could have been related to dinner. But the feverish chills continued well into the following day, Sunday 1/10. Sunday morning I woke up still  feverish with a temp of 99.7, and also achy with a slight sore throat. I drank plenty of fluids and napped during the day of 1/10 to break the fever, followed with day-quil and ny-quil at night. On Monday, 1/11 I woke up feeling much improved and no longer felt ill.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

                                                Immediately got redness of injection site feeling of nausea. Needed to take my mask off to get fresh air.  Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47).

However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

A 25-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number: EK9231), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm, on 13Jan2021 at 08:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included anxiety. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from 2018 and ongoing (for two-and-a-half years) for anxiety. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (Lot Number: EK5730) on 22Dec2020 at 09:00 AM (in the right arm) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient was calling to report side effects. After the second dose on 13Jan2021, the patient noticed around 18:00 that the muscles in her back became stiff and tight. It got worse overnight and, in the morning (14Jan2021), she had to walk bent over. This stiffness progressed to her whole body. That morning she also noticed her hands felt tingly (like when they fall asleep) and she had a migraine with vomiting and dizziness. All of these effects started to resolve but now her muscles are still very sore (Jan2021). The migraine went away this morning as did the vomiting and dizziness. The patient recovered from &#34;Hands felt tingly&#34;, &#34;Migraine&#34;, &#34;Vomiting&#34;, and &#34;Dizziness&#34; on 15Jan2021. The patient had not recovered from &#34;Muscles are still very sore&#34;. The outcome of &#34;Had to walk bent over&#34; was unknown. The patient was recovering from the remaining events.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

                                                Per provider on site: Patient received Covid 19 Pfizer vaccine approximately at 1:25 pm. She noted to feeling dizzy when she presented to my station about 15 minutes after her vaccine. She stated to having history of moderate asthma, carries albuterol with her. She denies drug allergy, but had lightheadedness with MMR vaccine in the past. I checked her pulse rate, 94 regular. 5 minutes later, she c/o feeling worse. She had inspiratory wheezing to auscultation, VS stable. BP 122/72, HR 103, pulse oximetry 99%. She had albuterol MDI inhaler with her, I asked her to self-administer 2 puffs. I administered 25 mg of diphenhydramine. She declined 50 mg because she gets very groggy to anti-histamine.  Approximately 3 minutes later, she noted to feeling like her throat is very dry and warm, almost difficult to swallow. She describes sensation like she is breathing thru a straw. Her vitals remain stable: BP 133/74, HR 128, pulse ox 98%. Throat without swelling, redness, no stridors noted, but she continues to have inspiratory wheezing. She declined to have Epi given.  I made decision to call paramedics given high risk for bronchospasm. Paramedics arrived approximately 7 minutes later. Vital signs remain stable. She continues to feel like she is &#34;breathing through a straw.&#34; She is transported to ER

                                                Within a minute after the vaccine was administered, I started to sweat a lot, felt hot, and got very dizzy. I was also nauseous. The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

A nurse and another woman come and put me in a wheelchair so I don&#39;t fall out of a chair if I faint  - my eyes are going more black and I&#39;m profusely sweating all over my body - I faint and convulse for 5 seconds - I wake up from passing out and my hands and feet are extremely tingly and feel like they have a million pins in them -  my hands started cramping really bad and I can almost not open them for 5 minutes - over the next 15 mins the tingleynes and hand cramps completely fade away and I feel normal

                                                After almost two weeks I started feeling feverish and achy all over my body. I had head pain almost to the point of migraine, felt weak and lost my appetite. Every time I stood up I felt sharp pain on the top of my head and got lightheaded. These symptoms responded a little to medication such as Tylenol and DayQuil but steadily worsened over the course of a few days then suddenly worsened. I woke up yesterday feeling more feverish and weak to the point where my mobility was compromised. My head felt like a balloon and hurt around the base of my skull and the top of my head. I had even more severe light sensitivity and could not tolerate sound. I also couldn?t bend down to pick something up or tie my shoes because of the lightheadedness and pain. The headache and migraine symptoms responded well to Toradol and Excedrin but returned full force after any medicine wore off. I am not getting any better despite rest and treatment.

When I measured a few hours later it was at 137/90. It remained like that until the evening when it lowered back down to 120/87. Later that evening, I had a fever and took Tylenol to help. My headache got worse in the evening as well. Arm was sore. This morning (day after my 1st dose) my BP was at 108/79, fever creeped up as the day went on, body aches, arm was hurting more,  headache continued, pressure on chest made it a bit hard to breathe, dizziness, some nausea, brain fog.

After that initial phase, around 48 hours after the second shot on April 8th, developed extreme fatigue/exhaustion, aches, muscle pains, headache, nausea, chills, diarrhea, and skin burning/itching where I have existing scars. One week after 2nd vaccine (after 7 days of being sick) menstruation came early and experienced heavy, heavy bleeding. This is now day 2 of heavy bleeding and all other continued symptoms.

I told her to take Benadryl and to go to the ER or to the immediate care.  I followed up with her the next day and she went to the ER, she said the Benadryl helped her out significantly and that she was feeling much better that day.  She was still inquiring about the second shot but, she was following up with her MD on Wednesday.

                                                1st vaccine (03/26/21): skin rash, poison ivy like reaction across back (but not arm) began spreading 3 days after getting the vaccine and took 3 weeks to heal. Have retraced my steps and don?t think there is anything other than the vaccine that skin came in contact with.  2nd vaccine (04/16/21): upper abdominal pain / stomach pain at night. Not super severe but have never felt anything like it before.

                                                I received my first shot on April 6th, 2021, and on April 18th, 2021 I experienced extreme numbness with slight pain in the fold and shoulder of my arm. I went to the ER and they took a cat scan of my neck and reported back that everything looked normal - the nurse said it was most likely Cervical Radiculopathy. Then the following morning around 11 AM, I experienced very intense burning in my chest starting on the right side, eventually moving to the left encompassing my entire upper chest. I also experienced a very bad migraine, which I am typically used to but this one was more of a pressure headache between my temples that I felt in my ears and jaw. I made the decision to go back to the ER and to a different one this time. The ER failed to administer a Covid-19 test and to take bloodwork - both faults that family and friends in the medical field have pointed out to me. The doctor there had me receive an IV, a chest X-Ray, and an EKG. The X-Ray and EKG were both normal. The doctor had ordered a Covid-19 test but the nurse forgot to administer it before my discharge. In my IV I received Benadryl and Reglan along with typical IV fluids. I was also given Pepcid and Mylanta. At the end of my visit, the doctor concluded that he thought it was my acid reflux acting up - gastroenteritis. I went home and continued to experience chest burning, tightness, occasional numbness/pains in my body, and very, very bad headaches. On top of that, I could barely swallow - it felt as if my throat was closing. I took Pepcid and Tums and neither really did anything. After seeing a Cardiologist this same week, they ordered an Echocardiogram and routine bloodwork (metabolic panel). I will also be following up with a GI, and I received a Covid-19 test today and am awaiting the results. It is possible I contracted Covid before my shot, but it is also possible that I am having a delayed reaction to my first vaccination as well. Who knows.

                                                I have trouble swallowing solid food. Specifically, after chewing the solid foods finely (i.e. eggs, spam, meat, edamame), the throat will not swallow. It just feels like the throat forgets how to swallow, which should have been a natural response normally that does not require conscious thinking. If I forcefully swallow it, it feels like the food did not go down well and some pieces were stuck in the trachea and I want to spit out mucous. When I spit out, there were nothing strange, mainly just saliva. I had no issue swallowing liquid or soft foods (i.e. yogurt and steamed egg). I do not feel pain or swollen on throat but do sometimes feel there was something at the back of the throat. But again when I spit out mucous there was nothing abnormal. I went to the Purdue student health center and they did not find any abnormal in the throat, only seemed a little red but nothing abnormal.

My headaches have gotten worse and I haven&#39;t had much of an appetite.

                                                14 hours after the vaccine was received, I woke up so uncomfortable, no matter how I moved I couldn?t get comfortable. It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????

                                                Presented to ED today with complaint of emesis onset this morning. Pt received her second dose of her Covid vaccine on 5/3. Endorses hx of DKA. Denies hitting head, fever, cough, dysuria, nausea, dizziness. She is initially called a sepsis alert secondary to SIRS criteria although I do not think she likely is septic as she has no other illness symptoms but rather either DKA or dehydration from vomiting from viral illness or her history of gastroparesis.  Patient was treated with Benadryl Reglan fluid bolus Rocephin as part of the sepsis protocol and has had improvement in condition. The patient is given IV fluids along with antibiotics for what appears to be a UTI.  She will be admitted to the CDU for ongoing observation and management of her blood sugar as well as her mental status. She has Reglan and Zofran at home but was given refills. She has follow-up with gastro.

                                                Aside from the usual chills, body aches, etc, I ended up calling my doctor over a separate concerning issue - very high heart rate. I woke up at 8am the day after getting my 2nd Pfizer dose, walked to use the restroom, walked back to bed, and laid back down. Within a couple minutes I noticed my heart felt like it was racing and I was out of breath as if I had just come back from a jog, not a trip to the restroom.  Heart rate continued fluctuating from 105-115bpm just laying in bed. Was also feeling fatigued, nauseous, dizzy when standing up, and with slight difficulty breathing. Called advice nurse after 30min of no change. They had me check heart rate manually (had been going off FitBit), and timing was consistent with what FitBit was reading . Nurse advised to keep resting and drink lots of water, scheduled follow-up with a Doctor later in the morning.  It should be noted that I had been alternating between water and Pedialyte constantly all day, starting 5/17 through when this happened (and then the next few days as well), so I should not have been dehydrated. Follow-up call with Dr. (on-call Dr., not my usual one) was scheduled for 11:45am, and by then all concerning heart symptoms had passed. The Dr. basically reiterated what the nurse had told me, in keeping up with fluids. And that sometimes temperature change, even if you don&#39;t completely get a fever, can cause a high heart rate. As more information is coming out regarding younger people developing myocarditis after the mRNA vaccines however, I wanted to mention this in case it could possibly be related.

The report was not related to a study or programme. A 25-years-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot number: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration, in left arm, on 08Apr2021 at 3:30PM (at the age of 25-years-old), as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient had no medical history, and no concomitant medications were received. No vaccinations were received by the patient within 4 weeks prior to the first administration date of the suspect vaccine. There were no adverse events following prior vaccinations. No history of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect (or patient age at first and subsequent immunizations if dates of birth or immunizations are not available). On an unspecified date, 2 weeks after the vaccination (08Apr2021), she got food poisoning. When she had the food poisoning, she had a stomachache and fever. she was also a little bit nauseous. It was reported that as per the patient thinking the food poisoning was not due to the Covid 19 vaccine. On an unspecified date, 3 weeks after the vaccination (08Apr2021), she got swollen lymph nodes in her neck and had a fever and sore throat. On an unspecified date, at the doctor office, she had blood work and an ultrasound of her neck where her lymph nodes were swollen, and for both the results were unspecified. The patient visited physician office, where she was seen by a doctor, who prescribed Penicillin VK 500mg one tablet two times daily for the swollen lymph nodes in her neck and her sore throat. It was a pharmacy bottle. NDC/Lot/Expiry not known. The patient did not visit any emergency room. She has not felt fully recovered until now. The outcome of the events was unknown. The patient wanted to know about the timing of the second dose as it has been 6 weeks since the first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.

Pfizer shot #1 was administered on 3/12/2021 with minimal effects lasting less than 24 hours (arm soreness, flu-like symptoms, etc.).  1) Severe worsening of costochondritis (chronic chest pain) to the point of breathing difficulty and inability to lie down. Began 4/1/2021 and became unbearable the evening of 4/7/2021, requiring an ER trip the same night (see Item 19). This pain has since continued to come and go, worse than I ever had it before the vaccine.  2) Very severe worsening of tinnitus (ringing/pulsing in ears) - lasted 1.5 months, from 4/1/2021 to around 5/15/2021.  3) Severe hormone imbalance symptoms (waves of severe nausea occurring several times daily, extremely late and painful/heavy period, swelling in ankles &amp; feet, etc.) for ~1.5 months, from late April 2021 to around 5/15/2021. I cannot identify any other changes or life factors besides the vaccine that would have caused these issues.
