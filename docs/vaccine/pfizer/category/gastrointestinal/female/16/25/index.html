I was alerted by the pharmacy technician I was needed outside of the immunization room and patient had vomited. It seemed to be mostly stomach acid (no food particles) and was roughly 12oz or less of fluid (hard to tell since it was contained in a plastic bag. Patient sipped on some water, which she tolerated well. She stated she suddenly felt really dizzy and then felt the need to throw up. After the water, she felt better and was looking to see if eating something would help settle her stomach. She did not appear pale or diaphoretic. I encouraged her to stay longer for continued observation by she left before 15 minutes were up after the vomiting. She was in the pharmacy observation area for about 20 minutes total. She smiled and waved as she left.

                                                started vomiting the next day. We weren&#39;t concerned because this was expected and she recovered within two days. She improved the next day but became sick again the day after and every day since. We are now at day 19 and she is still nauseated every day. She vomits periodically about every second or third day. She vomited profusely today on day 19.  I am reporting this because the symptoms shouldn&#39;t last this long.

                                                My daughter was given her 2nd COVID shot at approximately 9:00am on 4-16-2021. We waited 30 minutes after the shot. No issues. That evening at approximately 6:00pm, she had a red rash on her upper chest and throat. She stated that she was having a hard time breathing and swallowing. I gave her  a Benadryl tablet and watched her for approximately 15-20 minutes. she continued to feel tightness in her throat and said it burned when she swallowed. She confirmed again that she felt her throat was swelling. I drove her to the closest ER located at. My daughter was seen and it was determined that she was having an allergic reaction. DR recommended continue Benadryl tab every 4 hours for the next 12-24- hours. We were discharged to home. I administered another does of Benadryl at approximately 10:15pm. My daughter went to sleep. I woke her up at 3:00am to check on her and she stated she did not have a rash and her throat was fine. She was running a low grade fever of 100.5. I gave her 500 mg of Tylenol for the fever. When my daughter woke later that morning at approximately 8:30am, she still did not have a rash or throat swelling. Her fever was gone.

                                                I got the shot at around 4 in the afternoon and after sitting in the waiting area for around 15 minutes I was allowed to leave. When I left I only had a slight headache, but nothing that seemed very noticeable. I felt a tad woozy but it was nothing serious so I went on with my day and went to my sports practice for an hour and a half. After I got home and had eaten, I was working and started to feel the effects. It started with an increasingly worse headache at around 9 and as the night went on it got worse and I constantly needed to lie down. My arm had started to feel sore but it was nothing much. I thought I could sleep it off but woke up feeling horrible. My stomach could not hold any food down and my headache had become really bad. I had to go to my sports game but on the car ride over (around 45 min) I got very nauseous. Throughout the course of the day my headache would get worse any time I tried to run and all I wanted to do was lie down and sleep. I was barely able to stand, let alone run and I felt sleepy all day. My arm had also gotten very sore and any contact on it made me flinch back. I was not able to eat or drink anything until about 4  in the afternoon and my stomach was not sitting right the entire time and I constantly was burping and feeling like I was going to vomit despite having only water in my stomach. After I was able to eat the stomach ache went away a bit but the headache lasted through the night and has finally started to subside two days later.

                                                Arm soreness, tightness in chest, dizziness, nausea, difficulty breathing. Symptoms started pretty much right after getting the shot but the dizziness and tightness in chest stopped after I took a nap about an hour after the shot. As of the submission of the form I am still feeling soreness in my arm but it?s lessened a bit and I still feel nauseous and am having trouble breathing properly.

                                                Per EMT, patient became diaphoretic and pale suddenly approximately 5 minutes after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine at a drive-through vaccination site. Patient was in car sitting in the observation area when incident occured. After becoming pale and diaphoretic, EMT lowered the seat and someone held the patient and patient became unconscious for approx. a minute. After consciousness regained, patient wanted to sit-up because she &#34;felt naseous&#34;. Patient sat up and the RN called to incident. When this RN arrived, patient was consious and leaning over and appeared pale/grey and cyanotic.  911 called. This RN put pulse-ox on patient and told EMT to get O2. Patient&#39;s O2 saturations were in the low 80&#39;s and HR 46. Patient immediately layed back in seat of car and put feet up on dashboard and given 5L of oxygen. After approx. 5 minutes on 5L of O2 and laying back, patient&#39;s color improved and stated she &#34;felt much better&#34;. O2 saturations improved to 100 after a couple minutes on oxygen and remained over 98% on RA X 5 minutes. Patient was not taken to the hospital and someone droved patient home with follow-up.

The skin that is affected is swollen.  Benadryl taken orally did not help decrease the rash, nor did topical Benadryl. She also complains of pain to her left leg from her hip to her knee that intermittently bothers her starting 4/30 and still continues to bother her.   The day after the vaccine was given she had injection site pain, tiredness, extreme headache, fever of 101.8, nausea, chills, body aches.  No swelling or redness to injection site.  No lymph node swelling.

                                                16 yo female came into our injection site today 05/05/21 to receive her first pfizer vaccine. She was accompanied by her father. Pt received vaccine IM to her left deltoid. Pt completed vaccine at 2:55pm at which she sat down for her 15 minute observation period. As soon as she sat down she called over the staff that administered the vaccine. She explained to her that she felt nausea and was breathing heavily. I then walked over to them and the attendee was very pale and breathing heavily. By that time I had RN getting attendees history from her father, She has no history of allergic reactions, not taking any medications and no current illness. She is &#34;slightly asthmatic&#34; but is not taking any rx.  RN was helping me by putting cold pack behind attendees neck. Pt then proceeded to explain that she felt nauseas and starting dry heaving. RN then brought over trash can and attendee started to vomit. I then started to proceed and take her vitals. first set of vitals were taken at 2:58pm BP: 90/60 HR: 132 RR: 24 O2: 100%. Attendee at this point was diaphoretic, pale, breathing heavily and vomiting. We continued to monitor attendee in which she started to feel better by 3:08 pm. She was no longer pale, diaphoretic or vomitting and was breathing normally. We provided attendee with water and continued to monitor her. Now that pt was calm, I was able to ask her some questions. She stated that she had a smoothie and an avocado toast about an hour prior to vaccine. She explained to me that she does have a phobia to needles and was feeling very anxious prior to appointment. I then repeated her vitals at 3:16pm BP: 98/60 HR:89 RR: 20 O2: 99%.  I had attendee stand up off chair and walk at 3:22pm. She felt fine and did not feel dizzy at all. No signs of distress noted. She was then discharged and walked out with her dad at 3:25pm.

She was drinking water and we got her crackers and candy. She laid down on the floor for about 10 minutes and started to vomit again. I asked her dad if he would prefer me to call an ambulance to have her checked out. He said yes so they were called. Her vitals were good when they checked her when they got here. They did take her to the hospital.

                                                Patient chronic conditions (JIA, UC) previously controlled on adalimumab.  Within several days of receiving COVID-19 vaccine dose #2, patient began experiencing worsening/flare of ulcerative colitis symptoms including stomach pain, diarrhea, fatigue, arthritis pain that lasted beyond the reasonable and known duration of vaccine related side-effects. Symptoms treated with dicyclomine and acetaminophen with no relief.  Symptoms continued x 2 weeks.  Patient ultimately required addition of budesonide to treatment regimen for ulcerative colitis and is currently having relief of symptoms.

                                                Patient started swelling in the left hands on Saturday May 08th and inflammation in the bowel during Monday morning May 10th. She was not able to eat and had nausea. Patient stayed at Hospital until May 13th and got many exams as endoscopy and colonoscopy and did not find any reason for such inflammation. Also, blood exams were ok. The swelling in the hands combined with inflammation on the bowel sound suspect of reaction of Pfizer vaccine as there is no event close to this date to create abnormal effects of swelling and inflammation.

                                                12 hours post vaccine she had severe myalgia, rash on both arms and legs, headache, nausea, stomach pain, and mild swelling in legs. Over the next 48 hours the rash darkened and spread to the entire body causing pain in her skin. The myalgia became nearly unbearable and both Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen didn&#39;t put a dent in the pain. One side of her face swelled so that one eye could only partially open. The nausea and stomach pain worsened so that she couldn&#39;t eat. Headache became intense. By 48 hours post vaccine she became delirious - her speech was slurred and difficult to comprehend. She would fall asleep for a few minutes and wake up unaware of where she was or what was happening. She never got a fever but did have chills. Around this time I called a relative who is a doctor to seek advice and Diphenhydramine was recommended. Benedryl helped immensely. 30 minutes after taking it she could speak clearly, was more alert, pain became tolerable, and her appetite returned. Symptoms and swelling returned when the Benedryl wore off so she continued taking it every 4 hours for the next two days until it wasn&#39;t necessary any more. The myalgia, stomach pain and headache persisted for 7 days. At 8 days post vaccine (today) a mild headache, mild and intermittent stomach pain, and mild fatigue are her only remaining symptoms. Her pediatrician cannot see her until next week but we have an appt for the 22nd.

She remained seated in the room and closed her eyes a couple times but never appeared to lose consciousness.  Her dad joined us in the room and confirmed she was really nervous before the vaccine.  We kept her seated for several minutes and then she said she felt sick and vomited.  After that she started to regain her color and was able to move to the waiting room.  She sat there for about 5 more minutes and then felt well enough to leave with her dad.

A 16-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left arm on 08Apr2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as 1st dose, SINGLE dose (at the age of 16 years old) for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included asthma from 2018 and ongoing (Has been asthmatic about 3 years and has it under control and hasn&#39;t had issues in years).  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  Last time at the doctors office was for her well check in Oct or Nov. The patient did not receive any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine.  On 21Apr2021, the patient experienced anaphylactic reaction, anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing and face swelling. They are not sure if it (anaphylactic reaction) is related to the vaccine. She does not have any allergic issues of any kind and is not sure if it is from the vaccine. The patient has an appointment with an allergist on 05May2021. The pediatrician recommended she wait to get the second dose until after the mother talked to the allergist. She is scheduled for the second dose 30Apr2021. The consumer stated the daughter will miss her second dose tomorrow. The pediatrician told her to wait until speaking to the allergist. If the allergist clears her, it wont be until 05May2021. How long would it be until she can get the second dose. She is not sure if it is related or not. It was 2 weeks after. She ate some kind of granola bar that may have been the cause. Before she called 911 and they gave her epinephrine, it lasted anywhere between maybe up to 15 or 20 minutes. She went to the emergency room (ER) and had to be observed 4 to 5 hours and then went home. Treatment for the events included Epinephrine, steroids and she believes a dose of Pepcid. She was on steroids for like 4 days. The steroid was prednisone. Outcome of anaphylactic shock, vomiting, broke out head to toe in hives, trouble breathing, face swelling were recovered on 21Apr2021. Outcome of anaphylactic reaction was unknown.

In the course of the visit to the ER, they took a CT scan of the abdomen, and there saw evidence of Covid in the lungs. They did a nose swab test, and she tested positive. She had some mild symptoms (stuffy head, headache, mild sore throat) earlier in the week (May 8 - May 9), but we thought it was possibly allergies. Turns out it was Covid and we didn&#39;t know it.  It seems that with the Covid virus already in the system, the shot caused an extreme reaction.

Blood pressure was stable heart rate was approximately 130.  The home care aide was not able to tell me whether or not this was her baseline.  Her brother said that she does not does not answer questions depending on the day.  However I am not sure he is the appropriate historian.  She has a history of multiple medical issues including autism, quadriplegia, asthma, and food allergies.  As such she was kept here for a full 30 minutes.  At no time was there any color change.  No labored breathing or wheezing on exam.  There is a little bit of nystagmus and appeared to focus when questioned about how she was doing but without a verbal response.

                                                Patient was feeling very shaky, dizzy and nauseous 2 minutes after the shot. Patient said she felt like she was going to pass out. We laid her on the ground and gave her water and orange juice. Patient stabilized after a couple of minutes. Paramedics came out and double checked on her, but mom said she did not need to go to hospital. Patient walked away fine. Most likely nerves that caused this incident.

I asked her to go outside the immunization room and wait 15 minutes for observation.  Immediately upon leaving the room, she felt dizzy and made it to the chair to sit down, when she said she briefly blacked out. By that time, her father arrived, and gave her some orange juice to drink. She said she was starting to feel better, but that her stomach felt queasy. After15 minutes, the patient was feeling better and walked out with her father with no other reports of problems.

                                                Felt dizzy at work the next day after the second shot. Passed out and then was sitting down and I felt nauseous. I threw up 5 times and my arms started to get numb. I had a fever when I got home and I couldn?t move because my body hurt so badly. Migraine and dizziness has been persistent ever since and is interfering with my daily life. Been treating with tylenol which helps a little but not completely. As soon as I stand up and move I feel like I?m going to pass out.

She walked out of the immunization room to wait in the store, made it about 2 aisles over, and fainted.  Patient&#39;s father and the Pharmacist immediately got to her side.  She came to within less than 1 minute.  In the meantime EMS was called and the Pharmacist waited with the patient until they arrived.  EMS looked over the patient and patient was able to leave on her own after waiting out the nausea and dizziness that had occurred.  Patient also reported a headache which was most likely from hitting her head on the way down.

                                                Patient not seen in office.  History obtained via phone from father of patient and patient herself.  Very early on 4/19/2021, 8hrs after receiving her 2nd Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination, patient began developing nausea, chills, sweating, fever and malaise.  Highest fever was 102.3&#39;, with symptoms treated with Advil 600mg.  Had x1 episode of vomiting that day, none since. The next day 4/20, patient woke up with new-onset lip swelling, progressing to periorbital swelling and swelling of her facial cheeks &amp; rash.  She then began having a cough with some throat tightness with some mild discomfort with breathing in her throat, but no chest tightness or wheezing.  Tongue not swollen per patient.  Benadryl 25mg PO given multiple times and patient used her Albuterol MDI a few times as well, which helped.  She continued to have fevers to 101&#39; throughout the day, treated with Advil again.  At night, patient then developed semi-itchy red &#34;hives&#34; on her legs. Per patient, she didn&#39;t feel she needed to go to ER for her symptoms or throat tightness/breathing issue.  She was still drinking &amp; urinating well  and had been consuming light solids foods. The same day 4/20 in the afternoon, patient was prescribed over the phone Prednisone 60mg PO x1 which she first took after 5pm, with tapering dose over the next 4 days, in addition to increasing Benadryl to 50mg PO and starting Qvar 80 MDI BID, while using Albuterol prn. Via phone call to father this morning 4/21, patient reportedly slept well last night and woke up this morning with significantly less symptoms.  No longer having throat tightness/breathing issues, with much less periorbital/facial swelling.  Still fatigued but no longer having fevers, either.

                                                Recipient is a 17yo who presented for second dose of COVID-19 vaccine. She reported some anxiety related to receiving dose #2, and had some nausea after dose #1. She was alone as a driver of her own POV.  Consent was obtained from the recipient and her custodial grandparent by phone, witnessed by doctor. She initially did well after the vaccine, but after approximately 5 minutes began to complain of feeling nauseated, lightheaded, and tingling extremities (hands and feet). She was noted to be hyperventilating, and was placed in a supine position but continued to feel some lightheadedness and difficulty breathing. Breath sounds were clear without wheezing noted, HR 70s with RRR. She was noted to have ongoing anxiety, nausea and symptoms progressed and although she remained normotensive to hypertensive (initial BP 128/74), she had repeated episodes of syncope.  She was transferred to the ambulance and further vitals and EKG were obtained. She had some confusion after episodes of syncope and some seizure-like activity with syncope, with very brief episodes of LOC, with noted tachycardia with HR up to the 140s during episodes of syncope.  BP ranged 129/86 to 140/84. IV access obtained and she was given NS and started on oxygen at 2 liters, but saturations remained in the 98-99% range. She was ultimately transferred to the local ER for further evaluation and management given ongoing symptoms, evaluated at hospital.

It then included both sides of her face; patient could not open her eye or control her face; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; her left leg had goosebumps and chills; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 17-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; solution for injection; Lot Number: ER8731) via an unspecified route of administration on 07Apr2021 at 15:15 (at the age of 17-years-old) as a single dose in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma from an unspecified date and unspecified if ongoing. Family medical history relevant to the adverse event was reported as none. Concomitant mediations included ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (JOLESSA) taken &#34;to decrease her periods&#34; from 2019 (&#34;about two years ago&#34;) and ongoing and at an unspecified dose, cyclic, for three months straight with no placebo. Then takes a placebo pill for one week straight and biotin taken &#34;for hair and nail growth&#34; from an unspecified date (&#34;she began taking within the last 6 months&#34;) and ongoing. There was no history of previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine, there were no additional vaccines administered on the same date as the COVID-19 vaccine and there were no prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. It was not provided whether there were adverse events following prior vaccinations. On 07Apr2021 the patient experienced began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache. The reporter called to report that her daughter had a severe reaction to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical course was reported as follows: The patient received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in her left arm. Less than an hour after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, the patient developed goosebumps and chills in her left leg. The reporter was not very concerned about it at the time. About 9:00PM that same night, the patient started complaining of pinching in her left shoulder. The reporter was not too terribly concerned. By 9:30PM, that same night, the patient started to have left eye twitches. Then they increased to eye spasms, then the patient could not open her eye or control her face. Then, it progressed to patients nose and left side of her face. At that point, the reporter tried to contact a nurse with the health insurance advice line. She waited for 30 minutes. The patient&#39;s symptoms continued to get worse, so the reporter took the patient to the emergency room. While the patient was in the emergency room triage, while hospital staff were getting her blood pressure and temperature, her symptoms also started to involve the right side of her face. Around 10:15PM, that same night, the patient started to get nauseous and a headache kicked in. The emergency department took patient straight back to a room. The patient was not admitted to the hospital. The emergency department started an IV on the patient, and they administered Reglan, Benadryl, and Toradol to treat her symptoms. The emergency department ran blood tests, preformed a urinalysis and a CT scan. The reporter did not know what all blood testing that was done revealed; however, the reporter did know that they told her that none of the testing revealed anything and were all normal. The patient was eventually discharged from the emergency department at about 1:50AM. She was sent home with Butalbital, for headache and was advised to take ibuprofen. She was still having the twitching but not as bad when discharged. On 08Apr2021, the patient&#39;s symptoms had not completely subsided, but were significantly better. On 08Apr2021, the patient woke up with nausea, chills and a headache. The reporter expected the patient to have these side effects. The side effects continued until very late in the day on 10Apr2021. The patient never vomited, was only very nauseous. The reporter also stated that when the woman was administering the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the woman said &#34;oops&#34; and it was not explained what &#34;oops&#34; meant. The reporter asked if it was possible that the patient received the dose subcutaneously and that was why she had these side effects. The reporter also stated that the second dose was scheduled for 28Apr2021 and she asked if the patient should receive the second dose. The clinical outcomes of the events began having left eye twitches and they progressed to spasms and the nose and left side of her face. It then included both sides of her face, patient could not open her eye or control her face, her left leg had goosebumps and chills, pinching in her left shoulder, nausea and headache all recovered/resolved on 10Apr2021.

                                                I had administered the vaccine, pt tolerated well, pt given discharge instructions and instructed to wait for 15 minutes at the observation area.   As I was waiting for the next patients to arrive, another technician notified me that she had a reaction of vomiting.  When asked patient stated after the injection she felt burning from the site to the nape of her neck and while waiting at the observation area she had nausea and went to one of our stations to vomit in the trash.  Patient was escorted to our treatment room  for vitals and was given a cold pack for the back of her neck.  Our Allergist provider was called to assess patient.  When I had arrived to the treatment room to observe her, patient stated this was the first time she had this type of reaction.  The provider ordered for her to stay and be observed for 1 hour with 15 minute intervals of vitals.  The patient had no other reactions and had no pain, vitals were within normal limits.

My arm stayed sore and hard to use all day and at night about 7:30 - 8:00 a sharp pain started lancing through my thigh to my knee, after a half hour or so it moved to include down to my ankle, then spaced out between the three randomly till about nine wen it moved to my side for about twenty minutes or so before becoming a dull throb in my leg till I fell asleep.  The next day I felt a slight ickyness that last off and on all day as well as a light headache that got worse in the evening. The soreness in my arm dulled down and was just about gone by night, as well as rolling nausea all day though light. Today I woke up a little icky, very tired, and with a headache that has lasted all day and worened during the night, the soreness in my arm is gone.

An 18-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot Number and Expiration Date were not reported), intramuscular in right arm, on 26Jan2021 at 07:30, at a single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included birth control pill. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel (CRYSELLE) from 26Jan2021 as birth control pill. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 on 05Jan2021 at 08:00 AM for COVID-19 immunization (in right arm). The vaccine was administered in a hospital facility. The patient was a certified nursing assistant (CNA) at a hospital. The patient and her mother both work at the same hospital that administered their COVID-19 vaccines, both received the first and second COVID-19 vaccines at the same date and time. The patient received her second COVID-19 vaccine dose yesterday (26Jan2021). Since 26Jan2021 around 09:00 PM, the patient was experiencing symptoms of chills, headache, fever, and nausea. The patient had a fever, clarifying that the highest temperature was 101.4 degrees, and also has chills and headache. Last night (26Jan2021 at 09:00 PM), the patient&#39;s stomach was not feeling right, had a low-grade temperature, and chills. On this morning (27Jan2021), the patient was throwing up. The patient didn&#39;t throw up until this morning and has vomited 4 times today. The patient has not sought medical treatment from an emergency room or doctor yet. The patient has been throwing up today. If the patient continues throwing up, and becomes dehydrated, she may need to go the emergency room. It was also reported that the patient started ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel last night. The patient&#39;s mother thought that the patient&#39;s initial stomach upset may have been caused by the ethinylestradiol/ norgestrel. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of headache and fever including ibuprofen and acetaminophen; the patient isn&#39;t taking anything for nausea at this time. The patient&#39;s mother wanted to see if anyone else had been reporting these side effects the patient has been experiencing since receiving her second COVID-19 vaccine dose. The patient had not recovered from the events.  Information about lot number and expiration date for the suspect product will be requested in follow-up attempts.

An 18-year-old female patient received second dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 24Feb2021 10:15 (Lot Number: EN6202) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included known allergies to Red dye, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heart murmur, Wilkies syndrome. The patient was not pregnant. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not take other medications in two weeks. The patient previously took Excedrin and experienced allergies. The patient previously received first dose bnt162b2 (Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 03Feb2021 09:45 AM (Lot Number: EL9269) for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. On 24Feb2021 at around 7:00pm she started getting a migraine at the base of her head. She then was lethargic, and became extremely nauseous. She started getting extremely cold and then hot within a matter of minutes (inability to control temperature regulation). Her heart rate rose to around 133 just laying down. Her ribs and lungs hurt. And her stomach began to have a really intense stabbing pains. At one point it felt as if she could feel every cell in her body if that makes sense. Not the worst pain she had experienced but definitely not pleasant. On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being run over by a car and 1 being a paper cut) she would say it was a 5-6. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. Facility type vaccine was facility. The patient did not have COVID prior vaccination and did not have COVID test post vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.

                                                I was already dealing with C Diff and still am, but it caused me to become extremely motion sick in the car ride home and I had to keep pulling over to vomit. As soon as I got home my injection arm started to hurt really bad and now the morning after I can&#39;t move my arm due to the pain.

                                                12 hours after receiving the second dose of Pfizer I felt fatigued and my injection site was red and swollen. 24 hours after the vaccine I was experiencing abdominal cramping, headache, and fatigue. 48 hours after I developed a severe full-body rash/hives/welts. It started as a small patch on my left arm and progressed to my hips, legs, arms, chest, back, and face - my whole body. The rash is extremely itchy and has caused me to bust blood vessels from scratching so hard and frequently. I began rotating Benadryl and Zyrtec, but it seemed to make it worse. I visited the ER in the middle of the night on 4/18 where I was given steroids and Benadryl IM along with Pepcid. The rash went away a few hours after, but has since then reappeared and I am currently running a low grade fever of 100.2. I am taking Prednisone 20mg 3x a day as prescribed by my doctor along with Benadryl 50mg every four hours and Pepcid twice a day. Despite these medications the rash continues to persist.

Offered patient water and allowed to remove face mask. Instructed on breathing slowly in through the nose and out through the mouth. This helped briefly but then patient verbalized that she was feeling more light headed and thought she should lie down on exam table. Remained at patient&#39;s side but did not allow her to stand up in order to relocate from chair to exam table. Approximately 7 minutes after vaccine administration, patient briefly lost consciousness for less than 30 seconds and had slight jerking movements during this time. Remained at patient&#39;s side and prevented her from falling out of chair, hitting head, or other injury during syncopal event. After patient regained consciousness, she began sipping on water. A cold, wet paper towel was placed to the back of her neck. Continued to observe patient in exam room for another 5 minutes then she was escorted to waiting area by provider. Waiting area was just outside exam room and patient remained in the presence of a patient care technician, as well as her mother. Patient remained in waiting area for a total observation time of 30 minutes. No other adverse events occurred.

At that visit was referred to ER, where workup for repeat clot was normal (CTA, b/l upper extremities dopplers, head/neck CT, CXR).  EKG was notable for Sinus tach and nonspecific T wave abnormalities.  Discharged home with close follow up.

                                                Approximately two minutes after vaccine injection, pt started to feel dizzy, saw spots, felt like she was going to pass out. Someone got a wheelchair and we took her back to observation/treatment area. Patient was very drowsy, felt nauseous, hands were tingling, and was cold and clammy.  We asked her to text her Mom, who was sitting out in the parking lot, to have her come inside.  Pt reported passing out with HPV vaccine and on blood draws.  We moved patient to pt bed and took vitals (listed below).  Patient was able to recover without any medication administration under close observation.  After about 20 mins in obs/treatment area, she was feeling better and we moved her to the observation room with her Mom.  We had leftover vaccine syringes, so Mom received her first dose of vaccine.  They waited together until Mom&#39;s 15 mn obs time was over.  Patient and someone left the clinic feeling fine and under their own power around 1845.

An 18-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot number: EW0170), intramuscular, administered in the right arm on 20Apr2021 at 12:45 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  The patient did not have COVID prior to the vaccination. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had not been tested for COVID post vaccination. On 20Apr2021 at 12:45, the patient and her father moved into the waiting area with vehicle.

At 12:57 the patient was visibly having tonic clonic seizure and was administered with EpiPen in the right Leg. 911 was called. The patient stopped seizing and was awake and confused. She then became AOx4 (oriented to four spheres; time/place/person/situation). The patient visibly distressed and hyperventilating. At 12:59 the patient had tonic clonic movements and seizure again. The seizure lasted less than 15 seconds. The patient then became AOx4 again, distressed, and became nauseous. Heart rate (HR) was 56 and SpO2 was 98%.  At 13:00 the patient vomited while sitting up. The patient was still distressed and hyperventilating with respiratory rate (RR) of 30. The patient&#39;s post vomiting HR was 116 and SpO2 was 97%. The patient moved to a stretcher and moved to the shade. At 13:06 firefighters arrived and the patient had an HR of 114, BP of 141/46, SpO2 of 97%, RR 24 and AOx4. At 13:12 the ambulance arrived and the patient was taken to (Place). The events resulted in a visit to the Emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the available information, and on close temporal association, a reasonable possibility cannot be excluded that the suspect drug BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine)  contributed to the occurrence of the serious event Generalised tonic-clonic seizure.

A 19-years-old female patient (not pregnant) started to receive the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EK4176), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 prior vaccination. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included the first dose of BNT162B2 (lot number: EL1284) at left arm on 22Dec2020. The patient had extreme abdominal pain for hours and diarrhea. She ended up in the emergency room and nothing was found wrong with her ultrasound, bloodwork, or urine sample. She never had stomach issues so the doctor thinks this was a result of the second dose of the vaccine. She have had experienced such bad stomach pain. The adverse event (AE) start date was 13Jan2021. AE resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of events included intravenous fluid and pain relievers and zofran. The patient recovered from events in Jan2021. Since the vaccination the patient hadn&#39;t been tested for COVID-19.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.

However, her mild daily migraine became more severe 2 weeks after the 2nd dose, her vision has worsened, and her eyes spontaneously dilated with pounding headache a few days ago along with nausea. It appears this 2nd dose has made her daily (mild) migraines much more severe.

                                                The night of the day I got the second dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, I felt like my stomach was on fire. I also felt really bloated. It felt like someone placed a sphere in my abdomen and then set it on fire. I tried eating, drinking water, and sleeping and nothing has helped. I have felt like this since then and it is currently 3/5 and I got the vaccine on 3/3.

Woke up on March 11th around 6:50am and felt the same symptoms as the night before but also really hot and nauseous, stood up and began to slowly lose vision. Went to parents for help and they saw me pass out and collapse. Went to  Emergency Room and they found I had a really high heart rate and I received an IV to help with rehydration. Was released after that and have continued to have the same symptoms plus muscle soreness but no longer feel as dizzy and haven&#39;t had any issues with vision or consciousness since.

A 19-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number/expiration date not reported), intramuscular on 23Mar2021 as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included seasonal allergies from an unknown date. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, it was unknown if the patient has been tested for COVID-19. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine 60 mg taken for an unspecified indication, and an unspecified oral contraceptive. It was reported that on 23Mar2021, the patient received Pfizer Covid vaccine and felt a little dizzy on 11:00. She also started noting mumbling, slurred speech, passed out for about 15 (unspecified) after using the bathroom, developed a &#34;static&#34; feeling in her head and then noted her left eye shutting and then weakness in her left arm and leg. She was taken to the Emergency Room (ER) for evaluation. Symptoms lasted about 5 hours. She fell asleep in the ER. Symptoms seemed to clear by about 8:30 PM. She had lab and head CT at the hospital which were essentially normal. She felt okay the next day, but had some nausea for a couple days starting on the 3rd day on 25Mar2021. She stated she feels fine at the time of report in the Student Health Clinic and asked whether she should receive her second Pfizer dose scheduled on 20Apr2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and Emergency room/department or urgent care. No treatment was received for the adverse events. The outcome of the event nausea was recovered in Mar2021, and for other events was recovered on 23Mar2021 20:30.   Information about lot/batch number was requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available and temporal association, a possible causal relationship cannot be excluded between the suspect product BNT162B2 and the reported event Passed out.

The patient reported, &#34;I was fine all day until around 10:30 pm I went into my mothers room and she was asking me how my arm feels I told her it was fine and right after saying that she said I passed out in front of her and then I began to have a seizure for about 50 seconds and then I woke up. After waking up from the event I had a hurt knee and sore mouth as well as an enlarged heart. I have no history of seizures in the past so it was definitely scary.&#34; The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included SARS-COV-2 test: negative on 20Apr2021. Therapeutic measures taken included anti seizure meds, fentanyl, and paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient recovered with sequelae from the events, passed out, seizure, hurt knee, sore mouth, and enlarged heart. Outcome of nausea was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A contributory role of BNT162B2 to the reported events cannot be fully excluded based on close temporal relationship and lack of alternate explanation at this time.

                                                Received the shot at 2:10.  2:15, she was feeling light headed and tingly sensation in her extremities. She didn&#39;t let anyone know at this time.  The person observing her noticed she seemed  zoned out and asked how she was doing at about 2:17 and learned that her tingliness was  turning into numbness of  extremities focused on her upper body.  She started displaying other symptoms of a minor panic attack.  We monitored her for the full 30 minutes, had her walk around, drink water, etc. She claimed that while her numbness wasn&#39;t getting better, it also wasn&#39;t getting worse. It was starting to itch though, so she was given some benedryl.  She then went home for the evening where her roommate could monitor her.   Next day, she called in to confirm that her numbness/itchiness had turned into a rash on her chest which has disappeared. But now is experiencing diarrhea, headache, weakness and dizziness.  She was informed that these symptoms were within the normal range of immune responses, but that if she was too miserable, she could go in to urgent care for medical assistance. She declined to do so at that time (approximately 11:45 am).

                                                Part one: Within one minute of injection, I was extremely dizzy and had to force myself to breathe. My hearing became muffled and I couldn&#39;t hear. I was hot and cold, pouring sweat. My tongue was numb and my mouth became dry.  Part two: As the dizziness began to subside, the second phase of the reaction started. I had nausea. I felt EXTREME abdominal/uterine cramping, which was the worst part. The cramps came in waves (Ex: cramp for a minute, subside for 10 sec, repeat). I thought I was going have an uncontrollable bowel movement as a result, but thankfully did not. The cramps lasted about thirty minutes. The dizziness became mild during this phase but was still there. I was in excruciating pain and debated calling an ambulance. This pain felt worse than when I broke two bones. During the entire reaction I felt extreme anxiety and impending doom (I did not feel this way prior to receiving the vaccine). For the rest of the day I felt tired and extremely anxious (impending doom).

These symptoms lasted throughout the night into the morning. In the morning on Saturday (3/27), and for most of the day I felt fatigued and slightly nauseous. At 5:00 PM that night, I was walking in the hall of my residence when I experienced a syncopal episode, which has never happened to me before. I fainted several times and my roommate brought me to the ER. Other than low BP, my EKG and other vitals looked fine, and the doctor sent me home with the conclusion it was likley related to the vaccine. The next day, Sunday 3/28, I felt naseua and dizziness all day.

                                                My right arm was sore almost immediately after being vaccinated, but it wasn?t bad. Then later at night when I was trying to get to sleep I was horribly restless, shaking, and feverish. I had to bundle up in blankets because I was so cold. My whole body ached terribly, and I had a headache. It lasted a few hours and I couldn?t get to sleep. At one point I felt extremely nauseous and ran to the bathroom, barely holding back vomit, but then it went away and never came back. The day after that (April 15th) I was extremely fatigued and still had body aches and a headache. I took my temperature at 5 am on April 15th and it was 99.4°. I mostly just slept a lot and didn?t have much of an appetite. My arm was still a little sore during this whole time. As I?m writing this at 5 am on April 16th, I still have a headache.

I was walking downstairs to take Tylenol and I felt like I was going to pass out. Luckily I sat down and then proceeded to pass out, although I am not sure what really happened. My mom found me about 10 seconds later confirming I wasn?t out for that long, but she was slapping my face and talking to me and I was unaware. She reported that my eyes were open. When I came to I was having cold sweats, I was clammy, and my ears were ringing. I was very scared and I don?t know what happened to me. I felt like I was dreaming when I woke up, but once my Tylenol kicked in I felt better. But it still was a very strange out of body experience.

The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included Nasal Swab: negative on an unspecified date. The outcome of the events was recovered on an unspecified date.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about batch/lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current limited available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events cannot be totally excluded/assessed.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate

She did say that the flu vaccine and some other that she did not remember the name of were the ones she remembered getting sore from. She did not have a manufacturer, lot or expiration for any of them. The fourth day was when she had a sore throat and coughing, that started in the morning when she woke up around 10:00. She had it all day yesterday and it was pretty severe and then she started getting better later in the night. Today it was less, but still here.

                                                My first dose of the vaccine was on 1/14/2021. I had a mild headache and experienced dizziness and nausea the night of receiving the vaccine.  My second dose of the vaccine was 2/8/2021. I felt tired the night of receiving the vaccine and went to bed a 8pm. I woke up at 6:10am on the 9th with a severe migraine, severe nausea and dizziness. I ate a small amount and laid back down. I got out of bed at 9am and noticed both of my eyes and face were swollen and my throat was swollen. At this point I called my doctor and spoke to a nurse on the phone, she was short saying I needed to go to ER. Personally, I did not feel it was necessary at the time so I took a Benadryl and Ibuprofen. Throughout the day I continually got worse experiencing the same symptoms as the morning including sharp chest pain, restricted breathing, a low grade fever of 100.4, severe lower back pain and leg numbness. I took more ibuprofen and  placed heat on my back. I took ibuprofen PM and woke up the morning of the 10th feeling better. Still have headache, lower back pain and swelling but is better than yesterday. I will notify my doctor today of the event that occurred yesterday (2/9/2021).

                                                5 mins post 1st dose vaccination patient began feeling nauseous, throat felt tight with mild pain when swallowing, tingling sensation from the chest down to her toes, facial flushing, and dizziness. She states these symptoms are common due to her history of EDS but today they are slightly worse since she got the vaccine. She was brought to the medical evaluation area via wheelchair and evaluated by us and EMS. Patient was administered Benardyl 50mg and provided orange juice and water. Vitals taken throughout and were slightly high in the beginning and then stabilized. Patient states her throat felt better and the tingling localized to her hands after 5 mins. Patient was monitored for over 45 mins. She was instructed to contact her PCP and her allergist to be cleared for her second vaccine dose. She was informed her 2nd dose should be administered at a facility where she can be observed closely. She declined transport to the hospital but agreed to follow up to the ER with any worsening signs of anaphylaxis. The nausea resolved and she felt less groggy upon leaving with her boyfriend.

                                                I got the shot around 5:20. About 4 hours later I started to feel nauseous and ran to the bathroom and vomited. About an hour after that I had diarrhea. I went to bed, couldn?t fall asleep until 3. I woke up at 6 am sweating a lot and having body aches that were very persistent and painful in my legs. This persisted to 3/12/2021 until about 6 or 7 pm and I began to feel a lot better. That entire day I was hot and cold and had body aches. But no longer had vomiting. Then on Saturday, 3/13/2021 I woke up with a sore left armpit and neck but the armpit was way worse. I looked it up ?sore left armpit after covid vaccine? and it said swollen lymph nodes - so I?m guessing that?s what both pains were as my roommate who had the second dosage of Pfizer vaccine  the week before had a protruding lymph node on her neck. They both are still in pain until today 3/15/2021.

She said she didn&#39;t feel well, and she didn&#39;t want lunch. Then she went and vomited. We took her temperature, and it was normal. We talked to her, made sure she was oriented. She then had a bout of diarrhea in the bathroom. It took about an hour for her color to completely come back and for her to feel better. She called Pfizer and spoke to them to make a report. They told her they have not had reports like this a few days after the vaccine was given. We were not sure if she should have the 2nd round or not.

I became nauseous, sick and had seizure like episode and then I had tingling sensation in my face and limbs. They gave me shot epi-pen - two doses. I was pretty much paralyzed for hands and legs. I was brought to hospital and they treated me there for about a week and I had muscle weakness. I gained feeling back in my hands but not in my feet. I was at Haywood for a week. Outpatient therapy and a visiting nurse for three weeks. B12; Iron; Gabapentin and that was for anxiety through it all.  Test results came up as neuropathy on left side of my body. I have pins and needles pain now. I did gain my walking back. I take Gabapentin for neuropathy pain. I went to hospital - went one day and I didn&#39;t get anything back from them.  I now use handicap parking for disability.

                                                i received my vaccine right about 12:30 that money and while waiting in the 15 minute clinic at the center i felt relatively fine aside for a dry mouth which i didn&#39;t even thing was a adverse reaction at the time. i processed to continue with my day and head to my 2pm class and while sitting in my class my throat which at this point was pretty itchy and felt like it was to some extent tightening. I also started to cough and wheeze profusely which is something im use to as an asthma patient but usually something has to induce that and at this point i was literally just sitting in class. i left the class and at this point it was getting extremely hard for me to breath i was coughing and wheezing essentially in a full on asthma attack. i drove to the clinic where they first gave me an albuterol nebulizer and then tried to give me a Claritin but just a few minutes after i threw up we tried again with a Benadryl and while i was able to keep that in longer i also threw up after taking that medicine. After my breathing calmed down a bit i was released to go home but there i had a fever and headache, body chills, extreme fatigue, exhaustion. nausea and  abdominal oain in my lower left side and right below my breast bone. for the rest of the night and even into today (march 23). i continued to take both Benadryl and the nebulizer over night and that has worked to help releeve symptoms but i still feel significantly unwell.

She can hardly keep water or medicine down. No sign of a fever. Right now she is moaning in agony next to me. She seems sicker now than when we actually had Covid-19 in November 2020.

About an hour after that I vomited and experience diarrhea. Returning to bed I had trouble sleeping due to the chills and headache bordering on migraine. Once I did fall asleep I would wake up dripping in sweat and needing to go to the bathroom for more diarrhea. This continued for several hours and several trips to the bathroom. The whole day after my vaccine I was unable to eat food, even the smell made me want to throw up. I was cold and nauseous all day.

A 21-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot number: EL3302) via an unspecified route of administration, administered on the right arm on 11Mar2021 16:00 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included low thyroid. There were no concomitant medications. After receiving the shot of the vaccine on 11Mar2021 16:00, the patient stood up and started to feel dizzy. She was able to find a nearby chair and fainted when she sat down. When she woke up seconds later of fainting, she felt throat pain like strep throat pain and then she started feeling very intensive cramps in her lower abdomen like very intense period cramps for about 10 minutes. The patient stated that nobody in the (Pharmacy name) was prepared to react to these symptoms and the rescue took too long to come in, when they came in she was feeling better and did not see the need of going to the hospital. But it was an immediate reaction that affected 3 different parts of her body that was very painful. During the day and the day after she felt very weak with no energy to get out of bed. &#34;I am wondering if I can still receive the second dose after this reaction to the first dose?&#34; No treatment was received for the events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Patient was not pregnant. No known allergies. The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a pharmacy drug store. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Outcome of the events was recovering.

                                                Approximately 10 minutes after receiving the shot, I started to have a bit of swelling in my throat that was almost identical to the reactions I get from foods I am allergic to with my Oral Allergy Syndrome. Another 10-15 minutes later, it had gotten worse to the point where it was harder to swallow, plus I was a bit lightheaded and my mouth was itchy. The people monitoring the post vaccine waiting section didn?t want me walking around, so they sent someone to my car to get my liquid Benadryl, which is what I take for similar reactions to foods. I took about 50-75 mg worth and waited for an additional hour or so until the swelling had gone down mostly. Now (at almost 7 pm on the same day), I still have a tiny bit of swelling in addition to the ?normal? vaccine side effects, tiredness, soreness in my whole body, headache, pain at injection site.

After 3 hours, I threw up, lost my ability to walk on my own, and briefly lost my vision (5 seconds). I drink socially about 1x per month, sometimes consuming many more drinks than I consumed on this particular night. Never before did I encounter these effects from alcohol when consuming 1-1.5 drinks per hour.   The next day I felt very tired, sluggish, and run down all day long.

                                                8 hours after the second vaccine dose, I suddenly experienced body aches, chills, and a fever. This lasted throughout the night (lasted 24 hours after vaccine administration). I had a lot of trouble sleeping due to the pain and temperature fluctuations (I would wake up hot and sweating, then an hour later cold and shivering, multiple times throughout the night). I treated the symptoms with Acetaminophen 500mg throughout the evening and the day after. The day after (24 hours later), I was fatigued and had stomach pains, with not much of an appetite.

Just before collapsing, I experienced nausea, dizziness, confusion, weakness, and seeing all black in my field of vision. Emergency Room doctors say it was very likely related to an adverse reaction to the second Pfizer Covid vaccination. Treatment included Tylenol and Ibuprofen, rest, and fluids.

Took ibuprofen in the middle of the first night and it helped a little. Fatigue and some reasonable arm pain and neck stiffness continued for a while. Migraine has continued since the vaccination; it&#39;s been 5 days. I&#39;ve had to take at least 2 Advil every day to help it. Can&#39;t even complete an aerobic workout even with the Advil because my head is shaking so much. I&#39;ve had mild migraines before surrounding my period, but they always disappear when I sleep and aren&#39;t there first thing in the morning like this has been. I feel so bad, I find myself having to keep stop walking during the day when completing a task just to hold my pounding head.  Not sure what to do.

                                                I received the vaccine at 4:30 PM and later that night, I had a headache and I felt very out of it. By the end of the day; however, I was feeling better. The next day, I woke up around 5 AM and my muscles were all tensing very strongly and I could not stop shaking. This went on for about 30 minutes, and then I stopped shaking and tensing  so much, though my muscles still felt a bit tense. I can&#39;t really eat in the morning, so I drank two glasses of water over the course of a few hours and took 2 acetaminophen. I stayed in bed until around 10 AM. Then, I took a shower, but while taking it, I felt very lightheaded and my vision had some black spots, and I had to sit down several times. After I got out, I tried to eat something, but then I felt really nauseous and had acid reflux for at least 30 minutes. Afterwards, I drank a bit of water and went back to bed. My muscles started tensing and shaking again, though not quite as intensely as when I first woke up. I felt very cold, so I turned up the heat and put on warm clothes. I fell asleep for about 20 minutes around 12, and when I woke up I felt a little less nauseous and headache-y. I stayed in bed for an hour, and I ate some pudding over the course of an hour or two, but I thinking about eating much else made me feel nauseous. I fell asleep around 5:30 and woke up again around 7:30. I felt better after waking up, but still had a bit of a headache and my muscles were slightly tense. On Sunday and Monday (today) I felt about the same, physically tired but otherwise mostly ok.

Over the next several days she had migraines, fever, nausea, diarrhea.  She had a very heavy period that was not normal for her.  She was treated twice for presumed UTI (once with macrobid and then with cefuroxime) in the days after the vaccine though cultures ended up negative.  She was referred to me, a hematologist, when she was noted to have a dropping hemoglobin and platelet count.  She appears to have a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and possibly ITP.  She is feeling a little better but her labs remain abnormal.  Please note this was reported on Pfizer website as well but I have not been contacted.  Guidance would be sincerely appreciated.  My cell phone was provided.

This non-pregnant 22-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EN5318) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 07Feb2021 at 09:45 (at the age of 22-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included depression and anxiety, both from unknown dates and unknown if ongoing. The patient had no allergies to medication, food or other products, and did not have COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included duloxetine from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (LARIN FE) from an unknown date for an unknown indication; ibuprofen from an unknown date for an unknown indication; and acetaminophen from an unknown date for an unknown indication. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient reported, it first started as a headache and extreme fatigue about two hours after the vaccine. She took two ibuprofen and felt better for a few hours, but the fatigue kept growing and then she started to get cold sweats and chills. The day after was the worse. She had fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain and fatigue, pain at the injection site, and congestion. She took acetaminophen through-out the day and couldn&#39;t eat much. The second day the fever and cold sweats went away but she still had intense nausea. It was the third day (as of 10Feb2021) and she felt better but still had fatigue and minor nausea. The events were reported as non-serious and did not require hospitalization. The clinical outcomes of headache, extreme fatigue, cold sweat, chills, fever, nausea, extreme muscle pain, congestion, couldn&#39;t eat much and pain at the injection site were reported as recovering. It was also reported that since vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

After that - upper respiratory  symptoms- cough, nasal congestion, sore throat - Tuesday - Saturday after the vaccine. I had a very sore arm - couldn&#39;t lift my arm up for about four days. Advil - cold and flu for symptoms. It helped manage the symptoms.  I went on an antibiotic for the respiratory symptoms - I had contacted my doctor and they prescribed it.

I knew it wasn?t an allergic reaction because I could still speak, but I also became very dizzy and sweaty. I stood up to go see the nurse and she took my blood pressure and it was slightly higher than normal and my heart rate was extremely elevated. I sat down on a stretcher and felt incredibly light headed and gained a metallic taste in my mouth. I also felt very nauseous and started experiencing chest pains. It felt like a panic attack but more severe and more sudden. My throat felt very tight but I could still talk, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire. My face was bright red. They gave me some water and monitored me some more and encouraged me to go to the hospital, but my symptoms subsided after about 35 minutes. After that I just felt tired and didn?t have any more symptoms.

A 22-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), second dose intramuscular, administered in the left arm on 04Mar2021 11:30 (lot number: EN6205) as single dose (at the age of 22-years-old) for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included rhinitis allergic. The patient has no known allergies. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen; cefuroxime; clarithromycin (MACROBID [CLARITHROMYCIN]); ethinylestradiol, ferrous fumarate, norethisterone acetate (JUNEL FE); spironolactone; acetaminophen; origanum minutiflorum oil (OREGANO OIL); tretinoin; ondansetron (ZOFRAN [ONDANSETRON]) and &#34;Olly probiotic/prebiotic&#34;; all taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported. The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2, intramuscular on the left arm on 11Feb2021 11:45 (lot number: EL9267) for COVID-19 immunisation at the age of 22-years-old. The patient did not have other vaccine in four weeks. The events started on 04Mar2021 at 11:45. Within minutes of second dose of vaccine, the patient had urination of dark brown urine. This turned to dark red/bloody urine. She felt migraine, fever, nausea, diarrhea. She started having a very heavy period which was not normal for her. She was treated twice for presumed UTI but cultures were negative. UA had no RBCs, but Hgb urine was 3&#43;. Her Hgb has been dropping from 11.9 on 06Mar2021 down to 8.3 on 11Mar2021 and it appeared she has a Coombs negative hemolytic anemia (haptoglobin undetectable). Her platelets have also dropped down to 59 on 11Mar2021 from 80 on 06Mar2021. WBC/diff are normal. LDH was 2019 on 10Mar2021 and improved to 1728 on 11Mar2021. Blood smear had no schistocytes, but ADAMTS13 was pending (unknown results). Her creatinine remains normal and electrolytes were largely normal. She had max AST 206 on 09Mar2021 down to 118 on 11Mar2021. Alk phos was 137 mild elevated on 09Mar2021 and was now normal. Her symptoms were slowly improving but she still felt poorly. Several other tests were pending, and they were checking daily labs. The adverse events resulted in a clinic visit and a visit to the emergency room. The patient received unspecified antibiotics twice for presumed UTI, ER visit gave fluids, Tylenol and Zofran ODT. The patient had no covid prior to vaccination. The patient was not covid tested post vaccination. The patient has not recovered from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events coombs negative haemolytic anaemia and aspartate aminotransferase increased and the suspect drug BNT162B2.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (31Dec2020), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.   This is a spontaneous report from a contactable Nurse.  A female patient of an unspecified age received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number EH9899, Expiry Date: Mar2021), intramuscular at Deltoid Left on 29Dec2020 07:20 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included covid-19 from Nov2020 to an unknown date (had covid in the middle of November), surgeries from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (She also had previous surgeries and has foreign objects in her body. Those areas were super hot. Those antibodies were like rejecting those foreign bodies because they were super hot.)  There were no concomitant medications.  Received call from RN calling about the Pfizer COVID vaccine. She got the vaccine on Tuesday and had a terrible reaction to it and she called a couple of different hotlines and spoke with the people who administered it. She confirmed that she did not report to Pfizer though. The people at her work that she spoke with told her to go to an Urgent care. They told her she should not get it within 90 days of having COVID. She had COVID in the middle of Nov2020. She went ahead and got it on Tuesday and had this terrible reaction. She would like to know if she should get the second dose or wait until 90 days after she had COVID and start again. There was no prescriber. She received it as part of the (hospital name withheld) front line health worker precaution. She thought that this was a normal reaction, but was told it was not. Fatigue and overall lethargic feeling happened exactly 12 hours after receiving. She works night shift and that is her base line. Pretty much everything hit after that within an hour. She was told low grade fever was normal, but not 102. She never spikes fevers, so it is medically significant. It persisted for 24 hours and is better today. She is on the 48 hour mark now. Stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea, lymph node swelling all over, including swelled armpits and groin area, Migraine, Frequent urination, were also listed as side effects. She was trying to push more fluids but her urine was dark color more than normal, despite pushing fluids. Swollen lymph nodes in her groin and armpits were concerning. Her head is lumpy. Meaning, she can feel swollen lymph nodes in back of neck area. Migraine was consistent through 24 hours and now has improved. Urine color remains dark and she will keep an eye on color. She had swollen joints, but really terrible swollen joints, and she could not move the arm that she got the vaccine in. She could not lift to above shoulder height.

Five hours after, the injection site had a pinkish color and felt sore. Then it was difficult to move my arm due to the soreness that traveled from my right upper arm to my right shoulder. I went to bed after taking Tylenol due to the headache and body aches. I woke up on 01/08/2021 with a severe migraine and general body aches. I took Tylenol in the morning and spent the day sleeping due to the migraines, malaise, and body ache. Throughout the day, I also experienced hot flashes and minimal nausea.

                                                Recieved vaccine at noon on 1/10/21 was awoken out of sleep from body aches at 1am on 1/11/21.  I had a fever of 103.0 at 3 am which proceeded to come down 45 minutes later and stay at 100.4 until 10 am. During that time I had a pounding headache, nausea, aches, chills and was profusely sweating and shaking with the fever.  Symptoms abruptly ended at noon on 1/11/21. This also occurred with the first dose that I recieved 12/23/20 at 5:30 however the fever and s/s were not quite as bad. This time they were definitely worse and prevented me from doing anything, I am glad I was not scheduled for work.

Treated with ibuprofen. 21 hours post vaccination was the peak of the symptoms, temperature of 101.6 with ibuprofen, strong body aches, weakness, and anorexia.

I knew all these symptoms were normal but being that on 1/09/21 It was painful for me to swallow I went to immediate care where they said I still had a fever and told me I had a swollen tonsil on the left side of the mouth which is also the side I received the vaccine on. I still continued to have a fever . Saturday night I noticed I had gotten some small sores on my mouth also on the left side . On Sunday I had loose stool , but I have been eating very soft foods because of my throat . Which then I went to go see a dentist and she said they appeared to be fever blisters , those popped I have a couple on my tongue as well . As of today my throat pain feels to be getting better .I did start a oral mouth rinse also for the sores

The throat constriction honestly frightened me and I almost went to the ER, but it eventually went away. For Saturday and Sunday, I developed fever, muscle ache, and extreme fatigue. Today, I thought it would get better but I still have fever and the extreme fatigue has not gone away. And unfortunately, as I am typing this, I think my tongue is getting quite swollen and is making it uncomfortable to breathe and swallow

I took my temperature at 6:00 pm on 1/20 and it read 99.7. I then took tylenol and at 8:30, I took my temperature again and it was 100.5. My normal temperature is 97.2-97.5. I took an ice bath at this point as my arm at the injection site was extremely swollen, hard, and hot to the touch. I called urgent care to see what medications I could take in addition to tylenol and they recommended motrin to bring down my fever. I woke up several times through the night and took medication. At around 8 am on 1/21, I took my temperature and it was 97.8.

A 23-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) lot no: EL1283, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she got the Covid vaccine on Saturday, 09Jan2021, and immediately her throat felt like it was closing up, she was instantly reacting to the vaccine. Since then, she has had issues swallowing; it feels like her throat will close up and open up.  She also felt dizzy, shaky, nauseous, extremely tired, and had a strong headache. She stated that diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) helps a lot with the throat symptoms and as long as she takes it, she feels almost normal but as soon as it is out of her system, it starts again.  It&#39;s like she is having allergy and hay fever type symptoms.  The lymph nodes in her neck feel like they are swollen, it feels like she has a big lump in the middle and sides of her throat.  She just came back from the emergency room and they gave her diphenhydramine. She wanted to know if she should she get the second vaccine. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and throat tightness cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The evening after I got the first dose I experienced painful muscle aches starting in my legs and progressing to the rest of my body, around 7pm. My left shoulder was a little achy, but no different than any other shot. About 30 minutes later I felt chills and felt really cold. I went to bed and tried to sleep. I woke up several times in pain. I did not take any pain meds. At 1am I went to the bathroom and felt nauseous and lightheaded. My vision got blurry and it felt like I was going to pass out, so I grabbed the towel rack and closed my eyes.  I must have blacked out for a second and lowered myself down to the floor. I came to, and I was sitting on the ground, sweating a lot. I stayed on the floor for at least 10 minutes cooling down. (I had dressed warmly and turned on my heater after the chills started). I heard ringing in my ears while I was sitting on the floor. It went away after 5 minutes. I got up and went back to bed. I woke up at 9am and felt a lot better. Some minimal soreness. No more chills.

                                                So I received the vaccine on my left arm on January 20th and the next day I had swelling on my left arm and neck. It went away within an hour or so. However, on the 28th of January, I woke up with supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on my left side of my neck. So, I have swelling and lumps/growths above my left collar bone. My left arm is numb and tingly and I feel very sick. I am nauseous and have body aches. I went to urgent care and they believe it is a reaction to the vaccine. I was tested for mono and strep throat and do not have either. I took a rapid covid test on Wednesday the 27th and it was negative.

When waking up the next morning, I had felt a slight fever, chills, nausea, continuous fatigue, and headaches throughout the day. Once I woke up the next day, 2/1, my fever and chills had completely gone away, however I was still feeling fatigue, headaches, and nausea and have not stopped feeling these symptoms since. My fatigue most notably has been present enough to where I?ve needed to call out of work. Eating meals also does but subside the fatigue by a substantial amount.

                                                On 2/10/2021, two days after my 2nd dose, I started experiencing mild abdominal pain at around 10am. I knew it was a side effect from the vaccine for I had been experiencing severe chills, fever, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and nausea the day before (2/9/2021) and those symptoms except for the fever had subsided on the 10th. I had been unable to eat all day on the 10th due to the pain but it was manageable. At 2pm the abdominal pain got worse. At 4:30pm the pain became unmanageable and I could not walk erect without severe pain. I was crying and bend over trying to walk. I had a family member drive me to the ER and arrived at around 4:40pm.  Lying down with my knees up seemed to help the pain a bit but was exacerbated when lying flat or ambulating. I was given Pepcid, zofran,  and toradol all IV push  at 8pm and the pain subsided within 15 minutes. Today I still have mild abdominal pain but I would rate it at a 1/10.

I had to go to the hospital, where I received fluids and other treatments from Saturday to Wednesday. I developed more nausea and diarrhea in the hospital the last two days I was there, which were attributed to a stomach bug that had been going around in my home.

I lay down for a short nap and woke up 4 hours later still feeling groggy. 12 hours after the dose, I began feeling very ill? I can?t describe it better than that it was like being hit by a car. Every muscle and joint in my body hurt. My temperature spiked to 100, and kept going up. In half an hour it went from  101* F to 101.5* F. I was exhausted, but could only sleep intermittently all night because I was in so much pain. I was also very nauseous and very thirsty? the only thing I wanted was Gatorade, which I drank 8 bottles of in 12 hours. It was difficult to walk up and down stairs. The whole-body pain faded after 36 hours. The pain in my left arm and the fatigue lingered longer, lasting for 72 hours after vaccination.

                                                20 hours after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine I developed right flank pain that felt like a kidney stone. The pain was mild at first but got quite severe within an hour to the point where I was on the floor crying. My boyfriend talked me into going to the ER, and I felt very nauseated in the elevator and the car. At the Hospital?s ER I received pain medication (Toradol and an opiod I can?t remember the name of), and a CT scan to determine if I had a kidney stone. No stone was seen on CT. After discussing the events with Dr., we determined that the Pfizer vaccine was the most likely, yet still quite unlikely, cause of my symptoms. I was sent home with some pain (Norco) and nausea (Zofran) medications and was told to follow up if the lain didn?t resolve over the next few days. My pain slowly faded and was gone by the next morning. Later that day (Jan. 16, 2021) I noticed I felt like I had a sunburn starting just superior to my right iliac crest and descending anteriorly about 20 cm, but my skin had no visible abnormalities. A few days later on Jan. 21 I noticed the area was slightly red. I took a photo and sent it to my mother, who is a PCP, asking what I should do and she instructed me to try applying topical Hydrocortisone. I did so 2-3 times per day as needed and the redness resolved within a few days. The sunburn sensation faded slowly but lasted until about a week ago (Feb. 12). Yesterday (Feb. 17) I noticed that my skin in that area is slightly numb. I can feel pressure and temperature, but I am unable to tell the difference between a touch and a light scratch. Sensation outside the affected area is normal.

Last evening I was up all night with fairly severe symptoms, including a severe migraine unrelieved by pain medication, nausea and vomiting, muscle and joint pain, and a low grade fever. I felt unsafe to return to work today and called out due to my fever.

After my second dose, I had a sore arm for the rest of that day, and the next day I experienced many symptoms. In the morning, I was extremely tired and nauseous. By the afternoon, I had a headache and my whole body ached. In the evening, my injection arm was swollen and red, and my chest ached and made it harder to breath or sit up. I was bed ridden and unable to get up for a couple hours because it hurt too much. After some rest, water, and aspirin, I was able to get up late that night the day after my second dose. Two days after my second dose, I felt much better without any symptoms.

Uncertain about time of loss of consciousness. Other symptoms included pallor, fast heart rate, sweating, nausea and loss of bladder function. No treatment required, seen in the ED and recovered without treatment.   Because she was driving a car at the time, she rear-ended the car in front of her and the airbags deployed. Underwent evaluation for motor vehicle accident as well in the ED with no injuries noted.

These symptoms subsided after 25 minutes. I then became on and off light headed through the remainder of the day. The day after receiving the vaccine I felt a lot of brain fog, forgetfulness, and fatigue. The night of day two I had a sudden onset of nausea and headache which only lasted 20 minutes. During this time I was massaging the injection site because it was sore.

Nausea, dizziness, haziness, and headache were on and off the rest of the day, subsiding around 6 PM.

                                                i received the vaccine at 3pm on monday april 12th. i started shaking less than 5 minutes after i received the dose and my throat started to swell and i couldn?t swallow. they placed me under observation for 30 minutes and gave me water?saying that ?i might just be afraid of the needle and not to worry, this is an abnormally normal reaction to a new vaccine.? after 30 minutes a man walked over to me and said ?oh you?re still here?? and chuckled. they then told me i would be fine after a while and to leave. i started walking down the sidewalk and almost passed out so i called an uber to take me to the nearest urgent care. i arrived at urgent care around 4pm unable to swallow and having a reaction to the vaccine. they saw me immediately and gave me 3 50mg of prednisone and a benadryl and placed me under observation for 45 minutes. he said i looked better and i even felt marginally better. i called another uber and when i was almost home my tongue started to go numb as well as my lips and my breathing was becoming constricted. i had the uber driver pull over as i had to sit on the sidewalk and get some air. i then called another uber to the hospital because my symptoms were becoming increasingly more alarming. Hospital admitted me and gave me a shot of epinephrine and IV fluids and kept me under observation for 6 hours. they discharged me a little after midnight with a prescription for prednisone, epinephrine, and benadryl. if i had been administered epinephrine at the vaccine site on monday and not been told i was just squeamish by the male air force cadets?i probably wouldn?t still be short of breath, painfully swallowing, and bedridden.

After 7 minutes, congestion, severe cough, vomiting phlegm, feeling like throat closing started happening. Code was called, Benadryl was immediately given intramuscular in the left arm, blood pressure, pulse ox was taken, and then was taken to the Emergency Department. In the ED, I was given prednisone, one EPI, anti-nausea medication all through I.V. and many more medications given to me via I.V. that I don&#39;t sincerely remember. I was under observation for 4 hours. I was discharged after all symptoms dissipated and was given Prednisone 20 MG (3 tabs a day) to take to help my lungs. Management followed up almost immediately, everyone from the moment I had the anaphylactic reaction was quick and prepared.

PM starting having extreme itching on dorsal sides of hands, used lotion that I normally use (sensitive skin kind) to see if it was just dryness. Red bumps still on just right hand 1/9/2021 woke up in middle of night to extreme itching and spreading red bumps on both hands. Bumps are small and fluid filled. Took Benadryl and went back to bed after washing hands. Early PM continued extreme itching and spreading bumps to wrists becoming more red and some bumps popping. Later in evening I noticed swelling starting in my hands. I have tried Benadryl cream (not difference) washing hands well (no difference) lotion (worse) hydrocortisone 1% cream (itching worse) swelling went from none to a non pitting edema. Hands hurt and swelling increasing over time more bumps showing up on hands (with no other changes to any products I have used)

When I received the first dose, I experienced all of these symptoms except for fevering.

Slept for 10-12 hours. Woke up fine, had no issues or symptoms. Later on as the day progressed, around noon-1pm, I noticed I had started to get a headache and some dizziness. Daily headaches and vertigo are normal for me, currently seeing a neurologist for this, but I realized that this was getting worse from the daily headaches and vertigo that affects me. Took 2 Excedrin extra strength migraine relief to no relief.

                                                Third day after receiving the vaccine I have been continuously experiencing sparatic and sharp pains mainly in my chest but also in my stomach and occasionally my back. It mainly shows up in my chest. Sharp and achey pains all in different spots at different times. This has been occurring now for 6 days and has not gotten better with time or any medicine I?ve been instructed to take by physician. Sometimes it throbs, sometimes it aches, sometimes it?s sharp and sudden. There is no consistency other than how painful it is. The pain has gotten more intense this evening 1/19/21. I have not experienced more than a half hour without any pain. It has been ongoing since 1/13/21. I woke up last night at 2:45am with a throbbing pain on the left side of my chest.

A contactable nurse (patient) reported that a 24-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE Solution for injection, lot number: EH9899, expiration date: 31Mar2021) on the left deltoid intramuscularly on 22Dec2020 08:24 at a single dose (30mcg/0.3mL) for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient reported she took the first Pfizer Covid-19 shot and is scheduled to take the second one today 12Jan2021. She had nausea and diarrhea and wanted to know if it&#39;s okay to go take the second vaccine, Pfizer Covid-19. The nausea and vomiting started on 11Jan2021 and she also had a headache, but the headache has resolved on 12Jan2021. She felt like crap. Nausea and diarrhea were reported as worsened. No other vaccines given at that time with the first dose. No vaccines 4 weeks prior. Received this vaccine at her workplace and they were very efficient and very quick. Did have a flu shot 30Oct2020. Provides flu shot Lot number of 33BN3 and expiry of 30Jun2021, left deltoid. Never had any problems with previous vaccines. No relevant tests done. No known allergies. Outcome of the event headache was resolved on 12Jan2021; nausea aggravated, and diarrhea aggravated were not recovered and unknown for the other events.

I took Tylenol twice that day and felt a small amount of relief. I woke up the following day, 2 days after the vaccine, still feeling nauseous, had a headache, temperature 100.4, fatigue, and body aches. I woke up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat. 3 days following the vaccine I am still having nausea with vomiting, body aches, and fatigue, my temperature day 3 is 100.1. I had to call into work because of my symptoms and the screening tool used to get into work flagged me.

The most intense headache of my life. I also got an intense stomachache and it felt like I had an ulcer. That progressed to a low grade fever, chills, myalgia, and arthralgia. The myalgia and arthralgia were so intense that moving to stretch my legs was incredibly painful. I was also very nauseous. The intensity of the arthralgia and myalgia subsided around 8am on 02/01/2021. All my other symptoms continued until around 11am on 2/2/2021. I still have a headache and some muscle pain, but they are manageable.

                                                I had several adverse side effects from the vaccine (which I was expecting given it was my second dose). I woke up with a slight fever that lasted two days (highest point being 102.5*F, but it ebbed and flowed throughout the period). I had nausea (threw up twice, was able to keep food down by the evening of the first day after getting the vaccine). I had chills as well, and standard body aches and headaches that often accompany fevers and chills. My arm was also sore at the injection site, as with most vaccines, but it was actually bizarrely most sore at my armpit, not at the injection site.

                                                I started to get a headache then became more fatigued throughout the evening. I went to bed around 9 pm and had some chills and mild body aches so I took some Tylenol. I woke up around 12pm with sore muscles and cramps/aches in my back, hips, legs, and neck. I also had a mild fever of 100.7 and was nauseous. I took some Zofran for nausea. I had chills and was flushed and sweating. That next day I felt like I had been hit by a truck, I was very fatigued, had little to no appetite, and had a pounding headache. I slept the entire day 1/25. The following day 1/26 I felt better but still groggy, I slept the majority of the day before heading off to work.

A 24-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1283), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 18Jan2021 11:30 AM at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included eczema and known allergies: NSAIDs, &#34;no gas,&#34; eggs, gluten, dairy. Concomitant medications in two weeks included dupilumab (DUPIXENT), levocetirizine dihydrochloride (XYZAL), magnesium, and ergocalciferol (VIT D). The patient previously received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL0140) via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 23Dec2020. She did not receive other vaccine in four weeks. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID prior to vaccination. The patient reported &#34;I had my second injection at 11:30 on 18Jan2021. By 20:00, I was feeling fatigued and at 23:00, I got the chills and a fever and severe body aches radiating from the left side of my body. These lasted until around 23:00 on 19Jan2021 with a maximum temperature of 100.8. When I woke up on 20Jan2021, I felt fine, no fever, very mild body aches. Around 16:00, I began to feel fatigued again, and at 20:00 I felt I was coming down with a head cold (nasal congestion, postnasal drip, sore throat). At 23:00, I started violently vomiting and I vomited 10-12 times over the next 8 hours. I also spiked a fever of 102.6. I was prescribed ondansetron (ZOFRAN) on 21Jan2021, which kept the vomiting at bay and on 22Jan2021, I had a negative saliva test for COVID. The events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. The outcome of feeling fatigued, severe body aches was not recovered; of chills, fever, head cold, and vomiting was recovered.

                                                Diarrhea and Cramping : I felt fine on Friday I was doing well. My arm was sore but over the course of Saturday it started to go away. The one thing that I have been clocking is diarrhea. I would have a cramping cramping feeling in my stomach on my left side it would feel like it?s coming from my uterus. I had first thought it was because I was in a sitting position and the 90° angle wasn?t great for my body and so I thought I just had to leave straight because even as I?m talking this right now like I feel a little bit of cramping sitting in a 90° angle. But the diarrhea is still ongoing it?s been waking me up at five almost 6 AM and I woken up at least three times in the middle of the night going into Sunday. I was actually fine during the whole entire day of Saturday because I was able to like be on a long meeting call but after that was done my body just needed to expel things. I did eat a tiny bit while I was in a meeting I ate cake   chocolate, A bunch of sweets. Also after I?ve woken up right now at 6 AM I drink some water and the water felt like it was sitting in the top of my stomach and I have to slowly very very slowly go down not in my esophagus in my throat in my stomach like it bloated me and as I was walking around it slowly went away I am trying to drink a lot of water because I?m conscious that I?m having diarrhea.   Is the diarrhea an an allergic reaction? Is the diarrhea a reaction to an active ingredient in the vaccine? (polyethylene glycol)

My heart rate was consistently in the 110s-120s and my blood pressure was in the 100s/40s. My highest temperature was 103.5. My fiancé is a nurse who took care of me at home. I alternated Tylenol and ibuprofen for the aches and fever. I slept the majority of each day and was unable to perform my activities of daily life or exercise. I lost my appetite for about 1 week. I had no sense of taste in Sunday, which slowly returned over the next week. I was concerned about the loss of taste so I scheduled a COVID-19 swab which came back negative on 1/11.

                                                The patient presents today with a history of recurrent urticaria and angioedema.  She received a dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday Feb 25th (lot number EN 6206).  She felt fine after her shot, but the next day felt fatigued, had chills, body aches, and left arm soreness (at the site of the injection)--she attributed her symptoms to her vaccination.  Friday evening, prior to bed, she noticed the onset of several scattered hives.  The next day, she noted that she had more extensive hives over her body, including her eyelids, and she said that she has been having dyspnea; she presented to the ER and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.  The symptoms or urticaria returned the next day with significant angioedema of the lips, and the patient had dyspnea and nausea/abdominal discomfort, and the patient went back to the ER.  With antihistamines and steroids, her symptoms improved significantly and she was sent home.  Her symptoms returned today, now accompanied by throat globus as well as abdominal discomfort--she self administered an Epipen, which she said significantly helped her symptoms.

                                                I got my Pfizer first dose today and it was fine at first, but four hours later I was slammed with incredible arm and shoulder pain. I have a really high pain tolerance (tore my meniscus 3x with no surgery or pain meds, wasn&#39;t too bad) and I&#39;m 24F, not on any medications. I keep reading that sore arms are common, but this is a 6/7 on the pain scale. Putting on joggers was excruciating and I almost vomited. I can&#39;t even bring a glass to my mouth with that arm. Even laying as still as possible hurts. I cannot lift my arm past my pelvis and my shoulder is immobile. I feel nauseous when I move it.  I haven&#39;t seen this experience anywhere so I am puzzled... I&#39;m fully vaccinated w/ everything else and the closest to this was the tetanus shot, which hurt but not like - this - level of pain. I&#39;m getting a bit concerned that the person who did it (in a hundred car drive thru) missed the deltoid and shot it into my shoulder?? It&#39;s VERY high on my arm. I believe in this vax 100% but I can&#39;t believe the pain I&#39;m having and why it&#39;s not mentioned anywhere.  Like I am so so grateful for this vax and am in awe of the science -- and everyone should get it   -- but I just don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m in literal excruciating pain :( Moving it even slightly feel like I&#39;m ripping it from the bone.   It?s now been 20 hours and the pain is worse than ever, even breathing, sneezing or bending over causes searing pain.

I took some Benadryl and Pepcid like I would for an allergic reaction. Then I went to urgent care. While I was waiting to see the doctor at urgent care my throat began to spasm and tighten and I had trouble breathing, this was about two hours after I got my vaccine. I was given a steroid and a muscle relaxant. My throat was quite sore for a few days after, but besides that I felt much better after I was given the steroid and muscle relaxer

                                                A week later, I had an anaphylactic reaction to a kit kat bar. I had previously ate kit kats with no issue. I had to be intubated and hospitalized. After extubation, I continued to have anaphylaxis at least once a day with no correlation to what I was eating or drinking. I also began having a severe auto immune flare up with body pains in my legs, back, and stomach immobilizing me with generalized weakness.

These symptoms have lasted for over seven weeks and are so bad to the point I cannot eat or sleep and have sought out emergency medical attention. In this same time period, I got what my doctors believe is Eosinophilic Esophagitis where my throat is now chronically inflamed, making it difficult to swallow. I am also experiencing extreme fatigue, anxiety, and mood swings when I never had a history of this.  I have tried taking several medications and PPI&#39;s with no success as well as trying every type of diet and lifestyle change possible with no success. I have not recovered from this and expect it will be some time before I do.

                                                Around midnight I woke up and was extremely confused, felt like I had  pretty bad cold, had some hives and started having some shortness of breath, that it kept waking me up. I also got nauseous. Almost threw up but did not. Took Benadryl and felt better. Had fever 100F in the morning, felt very fatigued next day. Went to work and the symptoms came back and they were intensified. I could barely walk. Took Benadryl and they decided to wheel me to the ER. I was unable to talk, I did not make sense. They gave me Benadryl and made me wait in the ER. I had tachycardia my pulse was fine. My BP was jumping around. I never had problems with that.  At the ER they told me to take Benadryl and Pepcid for the next 3 days. My fever went down while I was at the ER. The next morning I checked it again and no more fever and I was feeling a lot better.  I also had a slight headache, not bad. I called my PCP and they do not think it might be a good idea to receive the 2nd dose.

                                                Almost exactly 12 hours after receiving the second dose of COVID vaccine, I woke up from sleep curled into a ball, covered in sweat, absolutely freezing, teeth chattering, and all my muscles were shaking violently. I tried to roll over in bed and all of my muscles locked up and I began to convulse even stronger. This made me feel extremely nauseous and then I began to vomit. I know I had a high fever but I was unable to keep down any medications as I kept vomiting. I felt ill like this for the next 24 hours, with a 100.1 fever even after rounds of ibuprofen and tylenol, and severe muscle soreness and achiness, and headache. I also have intermittent nausea and will occasionally vomit bile. I finally woke up on 1/10/2020 and don?t have a fever, but my body feels very beat up and sore.

The nausea and puking went away a couple of hours after it started, so it could have been related to dinner. But the feverish chills continued well into the following day, Sunday 1/10. Sunday morning I woke up still  feverish with a temp of 99.7, and also achy with a slight sore throat. I drank plenty of fluids and napped during the day of 1/10 to break the fever, followed with day-quil and ny-quil at night. On Monday, 1/11 I woke up feeling much improved and no longer felt ill.

I have had no sudden stressful events/changed in diet/change in activity. Following the vaccine I had moderate lower back and right lower quadrant abdominal pain that I wrote off as maybe something I ate. This cramping pain did not cease and stayed at a severity of 4/10.  I did not take over the counters for relief. Upon wakening the the next day I found I had bled through my under garmets and had a severe headache. This went away as the day professed and I did not have any more break through bleeding since.

Nurse moved me to reclining chair and I proceeded to get very hot and feel like my heart was racing and skipping. The nurse noted some hitching and fast pulse, instructed me to take some breaths. And monitored my vitals. Noted my eyes feeling weird. They had epinephrine ready to draw up if my throat closed.. After 30 minutes I felt much better and they said my heart rate had slowed , I was able to leave.  About a half hour after leaving,  I got very tired, and my eyes still felt odd. Could feel my heart rate increasing again.  Began to get itchy/puffy eyes and nasal congestion with a tight chest.  I took a benadryl  and left work at the advisement of one our nurses to pull over and call emergency services if allergies turn anaphylatic.  Within 30 minutes of the benadryl allergies cleared up and I just needed to sleep.

A 25-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), lot number: EL014 (can&#39;t really tell), via an unspecified route of administration on 31Dec2020 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergy and heartburn. Concomitant medication included omeprazole for heartburn, cetirizine hydrochloride (off-brand for Zyrtec) as allergy medicine and a birth control medicine. Consumer stated, she just was calling this number because she didn&#39;t necessarily know if she had an adverse reaction or a symptom. She just wanted to report it and see if maybe you had any insight if this has happened to anybody else. Consumer further stated, she had an adverse reaction where she had to go to the emergency room. So, she didn&#39;t know if it was from the Vaccine or not because her reaction was very delayed. She got her vaccine on 31Dec2020, New Year&#39;s Eve and then starting on Monday after the vaccine on 04Jan2021. She started to feel not very good, it was mostly just like overall sickness, just as muscle aches, tired, having upset stomach so that was after 4 days. Patient had allergy from an unspecified date. And then on 07Jan2021, a week after she got the vaccine, she had signs of tachycardia and her blood pressure just like skyrocketed, her blood pressure was like 165 over a 114 and her heartrate was like 140 - 150. And she worked in healthcare, which was why she was one of the first ones to get the vaccine and she went to the ER and got worked up and they couldn&#39;t find, nothing was abnormal with her labs or blood work. She even had a chest X-ray and they couldn&#39;t find anything and they just gave her fluids and sent her home. And she was home now and still not feeling like wonderful, she felt better though but she just wanted to report that and see if there was any correlation. She didn&#39;t really know because it was so delayed, a week later. So she just wanted to report it. Consumer further stated, she forget to tell one thing, she was also short of breath on 07Jan2021. So that was why they had sent her to ER because of Tachycardia, shortness of breath and her blood pressure was really high. They didn&#39;t give her any medicine they just gave two big bags of fluid and then they discharged her. Consumer stated, she was scheduled to have her second one, she thought it was 14Jan2021. She wanted to know if she should get the second one. Consumer stated, when she went into the ER she had a lot of lab work. She didn&#39;t even know what all they did but a lot like, blood panels, she checked everything was there, that was on Thursday, last week, 07Jan2021. Consumer stated no treatment was received for the events. Outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

I thought the water was too hot, so I turned the shower head off and got extremely nauseous. I laid on my bathroom floor for an unknown amount of time. I thought I felt ok enough to get up to get clothes on and wake my mom up. I remember fumbling with the bathroom door and that&#39;s the last thing I remember. My mom told me that she heard me say &#34;oh God,&#34; followed by a thud. She discovered me lying face down on the dining room floor. My blood pressure was low, as well as my heart rate (47). EMS was dispatched to my residence due to extreme dizziness. Due to the fall, I had a chin laceration requiring stitches, a bruised fifth digit on my left hand, as well as a bruised left hip.

                                                I sat at the hospital for 15 mins after my vaccine shot and was ok. However minutes after I got in my vehicle and started driving, I started to experience hot flashes and a migraine. I had to pull over because I was unable to drive myself. Later in the evening, I continued to have hot flashes and started having chills. My fever became 100.6. I?ve taken Tylenol and ibuprofen as recommended but it hasn?t relieved any of the side effects. After trying to sleep, I woke up with a burning sensation in my stomach. I vomited and have had abdominal pain, aches in muscles and soreness at the injection site.

A 25-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot # EJ1686) via an unspecified route of administration on 08Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included asthma, and low blood sugar. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported.  The patient had rash on her face, chest, and arms on 08Jan2021 (10 minutes after the vaccination), puking on 09Jan2021, she did have a fever during the vomiting in Jan2021, red knot on her arm in Jan2021, her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm in Jan2021, have a black bruise in Jan2021, a red dot/red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch in Jan2021. The outcome of the event vomiting was recovered on 11Jan2021, of other remain events was unknown. Clinical course: She says after she got the shot on 08Jan2021  she developed a rash about 10 minutes after on her face, chest, arms, and they gave her a diphenhydramine hydrochloride (BENADRYL) shot and monitored her for about half an hour-45 minutes and then they let her go home and told her husband to monitor her through the weekend. Then Saturday (09Jan2021) morning she began puking and she kept puking through Monday and she still has knot about a week and a half later, a red knot but other than that she feels better. She did have a fever during the vomiting and she did have a black bruise and a red dot in the middle. She says it was red about 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch and it went away by Friday and then it popped back up Saturday but she feels fine. It was weird that it went away and then a week after on Saturday it popped back up. She has a picture of it, it came back and her arm felt sunburnt all day feel but she feels fine. She has never had all this happen before. It was so weird the nurse was calling to check in Saturday morning and she was telling her at about noon she felt okay she felt better than she did when she had the rash but then she just started puking. The vomiting stopped Monday 11Jan2021. She called to try to get an appointment and they told her that some people are having that reaction, like people that have the rash are having that happen. Her mother in law is having her take a picture of her arm everyday and send it to her, she is just one of those people. It went away everything healed there was a big back bruise it went away and then Saturday all of sudden it came back and her arm was burning, she would say her arm was burning about 3-4 inches around the injection site and into her shoulder and upper arm. She says she did report her symptoms through Vsafe she is not sure if that is Pfizer or not. She went online and use the paper work they gave her to scan the thing. She does not have a reference number to provide from that she is not sure if that is through Pfizer. She was a pharmacy tech but she did not handle prescriptions in high school so she does not think that counts. She has never had a reaction, she had an allergic reaction to tick fever but everyone gets a rash from that she gets a rash from dryer sheets but she has never had any issues with medications or vaccines. She says she has the packet they gave her. She has the vaccine in her car, she is an auditor working from home so she can go get it out of the car. She was planning on getting a second shot but now she is not sure she is thinking maybe she shouldn&#39;t because they are saying a lot of people that have this reaction have an anaphylactic reaction the second time so she does not know if she will get it or not. She is told she is high risk so she was getting the shot because she is scared to get COVID she thinks she may would have to go in the hospital or something so she does as much as she can, staying away from people and always wearing a mask. They get groceries delivered and food delivered.

A 25-year-old female (not pregnant at the time of vaccination) patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (Lot number and expiration date unknown since not available/provided to reporter at the time of report completion), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 22Jan2021 11:45 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a Nursing Home/Senior Living Facility. The patient&#39;s medical history included known allergies: Sulfa and poppy seed. No other known medical history/conditions. For concomitant medications, the patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient previously took amoxicillin, clarithromycin (BIAXIN) and cefaclor (CECLOR), and experienced drug allergy. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination, and had not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. After receiving the vaccine, the patient was sitting in the observation area for about 10 minutes when she started to feel dizzy and nauseous. She raised her hand up and called for the nurse to come over. She passed out. She was pulseless for 30 seconds and they had to begin giving her CPR chest compressions. She woke up lying on the ground and was taken to the emergency room (ER) where they ran tests to see how she was doing and for observation for several hours. The patient was &#34;discharged&#34; this afternoon and was doing better. The events result in emergency room/department or urgent care. Treatment was received for the events, ER observation and care, and CPR chest compressions. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included test on 22Jan2021: unknown results. The outcome of events at the time of last observation was recovering. The reporter&#39;s assessment of the events was non-serious, no results in death, no life threatening, not causing/prolonging hospitalization, no disabling/incapacitating, no congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported passed out and pulseless for 30 seconds were likely related to the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.   However, considering the clinical course and medical history, other cause(s)/confounding factors cannot be excluded.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                At 7:00am the morning after receiving my second dose of the vaccine, I arose from bed and went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. At the sink, I immediately started feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded and felt like I was going to throw up. I was also extremely clammy and started sweating. I tried to make my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water and blacked out and the next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of my apartment hallway covered in sweat and screaming and crying. I called my primary care physician&#39;s office and spoke with a triage nurse who advised me to go to the ER for examination due to my loss of consciousness and lingering feelings of dizziness, nauseous, and body aches.

I had to stop working and I laid down to rest and slept for 4-5 hrs. Continued to feel weak with a loss of appetite for the remainder of the day and slept through the night.  Tuesday, March 16th I began work around 8am and by 9:20am I had to stop due to a pounding headache and extreme nausea and muscle aches in my back. My eyes were sensitive to light, my head hurt and felt a lot of pressure in the front of my head and back of my neck and my  ears were beginning to hurt and ring. I took acetaminophen and slept for 3-4hrs. When I woke up the nausea had subsided but I still had a lingering headache, just not as terrible, and took additional acetaminophen 500mg. This headache continued for the rest of the day into the night, waking me up to the point of needing another 500mg acetaminophen and waking up the next morning Wednesday, March 17th with still a slight lingering headache, slight sensitivity to light, light nausea, light muscle/body ache, and general feeling of weakness.

Severe diarrhea began the day after vaccination (3/21/21) at approx. 10pm with symptoms of bloating, heartburn, cramps, gas and soft stool that progressed to explosive watery diarrhea lasting until 11:30pm. On 3/22/21, I experienced a feeling of an unsettled stomach with some mild nausea, decreased appetite, and overall feeling of fatigue throughout the day with mild body aches, which was treated with 1 dose of Advil.

She noted to feeling dizzy when she presented to my station about 15 minutes after her vaccine. She stated to having history of moderate asthma, carries albuterol with her. She denies drug allergy, but had lightheadedness with MMR vaccine in the past. I checked her pulse rate, 94 regular. 5 minutes later, she c/o feeling worse. She had inspiratory wheezing to auscultation, VS stable. BP 122/72, HR 103, pulse oximetry 99%. She had albuterol MDI inhaler with her, I asked her to self-administer 2 puffs. I administered 25 mg of diphenhydramine. She declined 50 mg because she gets very groggy to anti-histamine.  Approximately 3 minutes later, she noted to feeling like her throat is very dry and warm, almost difficult to swallow. She describes sensation like she is breathing thru a straw. Her vitals remain stable: BP 133/74, HR 128, pulse ox 98%. Throat without swelling, redness, no stridors noted, but she continues to have inspiratory wheezing. She declined to have Epi given.  I made decision to call paramedics given high risk for bronchospasm. Paramedics arrived approximately 7 minutes later. Vital signs remain stable. She continues to feel like she is &#34;breathing through a straw.&#34; She is transported to ER

The nurse was very responsive and had me put my jacket on, zip it all the way up, and allowed me to lay down. She provided water and snacks. I was very dizzy for 5-10 minutes. The nurse helped me perform calming excecises, which helped a lot. I then slowly started to feel better. After about 30 minutes I was able to stand up and felt mostly normal. It has been 3 hours and I am only a little fatigued, but otherwise okay. I have not had any issues with shots in my adulthood, but as a child, I remember turning white and vomiting after a flu shot. So I may be subconsciously adverse to shots.

                                                About 10 minutes after the second dose, I noticed the hives and irritation come on my throat, neck and my arm. I talked to the people who were monitoring and they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl and they kept me for 45- one hour. They Benadryl took about 20-30 minutes to for having the hives and irritation go away. After that happened, I went home and I started to get body aches and feeling very fatigued; a little bit nauseous.  I did have some soreness and swelling on my arm after vaccine that lasted two or three days. The fatigue and body aches lasted for one day. The hives and irritation on my throat and neck and arm didn&#39;t come back after the dose of Benadryl.  I had a doctor appt on Feb 8 about the side affects of the vaccine - he told me if hives came back to take Benadryl.

                                                Within 1 or 2 hours, I was getting hives on my arms and my neck. My throat was getting irritated and swollen a little bit. I did not do anything for the symptoms at that time.  I was just drinking water and waiting for those symptoms going away and they went away in about four- six hours.  Doctor check-up the following Monday for these symptoms but the hives were gone. I was nauseous for about four days. I was kind of tired. At injection site - it was kind of red and swollen but those went away after one day - that I got when I had the hives and irritated/swollen throat. I started having dizziness - a few hours after the vaccine and that lasted for about six days where I would get dizzy on and off throughout the day.  I had my second vaccine on February 6 2021. I was recovered from these adverse events before 2nd dose.

                                                14 hours after the vaccine was received, I woke up so uncomfortable, no matter how I moved I couldn?t get comfortable. It was the kind of uncomfortable where I swear I could feel it in my bones. Laid in bed until 8:30 when baby boy woke up, promptly threw up, got so nauseated and dizzy that I could not move from the bathroom floor, and had to ask grandma to bring me my medicines. The mix of ibuprofen, migraine medication, and anti-nausea all combined made me feel no symptoms for several hours until they wore off and I lost all ability to stand. My legs just felt so weak. And now I?m finally starting to feel a little better, and it?s been 2.5 days now. Boy, those side effects are no joke. Still worth it though so I don?t bring a deadly virus home to my baby boy ?????
