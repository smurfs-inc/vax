                                                fainted; Nausea; lips white; Really pale; 12 year old daughter; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 12-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 14May2021 got it closer to 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was reported: First letter was R, W or B, followed by A6256) at the age of 12-years-old as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization.

No family medical history relevant to adverse event, reporter who was the patients mother, is a fainter, who fainted a lot when she saw blood. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. As they were driving away, her daughter started feeling really nauseous, then fainted, was super pale, lips were white and she was really pale. It all occurred at the same time all started 10 minutes after vaccine on 14May2021. Then the ambulance came. Her daughter looked really bad and it freaked reporter out. Her daughter sat for a little while and was feeling better now. Her daughter was no longer pale, it went away. They checked her and everything was normal. No Emergency Room and no Physician Office visit required. Ambulance was called, they checked her and she was fine. Told her to keep any eye on her at home.

                                                It was within 5 minutes, she started having hives that went down her arm and spread to other arm, face, trunk, legs, stomach. I went and got a nurse and she called a pediatric team - three nurses and one doctor - they took her vitals and gave her some Benadryl - 30 ML (children&#39;s). They had her sit and drink a bottle of water. We watched to see if the swelling and the hives would shrink and go away. It was probably about 20 minutes later where they went away, but she developed a headache and she was nauseated. We administered Benadryl (gave her regular 25 mg tablet every 6 hours)  for the next 24 hors in the dosage times. She was nauseated the first day and she had headache for two days. The hives went away by the time she went to bed the evening of the vaccine.

Patient&#39;s pulse was faint, but became palpable once patient started talking again. Patient was breathing spontaneously. Patient reports last meal at 10am (7-8 hours prior vaccine administration), and anxiety to needles. Mother reports that patient faints with vaccine administration. Patient was taken to a cot to lay for 15 minutes and instructed to slowly drink sips of water in case of vomiting. Patient&#39;s symptoms resolved 15 minutes after laying supine.

The arm that got the injection was also really hot.  I had the patient lay down, and gave her an ice pack for her neck/arm.  After a few minutes patient said that she felt better.  I had her lay down for about 5 minutes.  She then sat up and said she was much better.  Wasn&#39;t dizzy or nauseous anymore.  Arm felt better too.  I had the patient sit and wait in total 30 minutes.  Mom wanted to leave sooner but I asked if she wait so that we could make sure she was ok.  THey waited 30minutes and left .  patient was fine.

                                                She was taking  Claritin for the few days before this event. She normally takes it every fall and every spring. She had seasonal allergy symptoms on the days leading up to this event- she had sore throat, runny nose, a little headache and congestion and developed a cough; on the day of this symptoms she spiked a low grade fever - 100.5. I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

                                                Beginning Thursday night, fever onset reached 101. Patient reported extreme fatigue but aches and sore arm made sleeping difficult. By 2 am on Friday, June 11th, vomiting and diarrhea began. Patient was given 200 mg of Tylenol and 25 mg of Benadryl. Arnaca gel was applied to the rash that formed on the vaccine site. The rash was approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm tall oval shape. It was bright red and painful to touch (like a sunburn). Arm was also swollen from shoulder to elbow. Patient slept from 4 am - 8am on 6/11. All day on 6/11 patient had trouble keeping down fluids (tried water, juice, gatorade, and broth) and patient refused food (tried popsicles, rice, bananas, scrambled eggs, and plain noodles). Patient complained of throbbing pain in left arm. Patient refused to massage the area and would screen in pain and cry with tears if mom touched it at all. Cold packs and warm packs brought no relief. Patient continued to receive Tylenol every four hours. Fever would reach 102-102.5, break with sweats. Patient reported feeling very cold and then very hot. Fever break would last 30 min - 1 hour before climbing again.   Sunday 6/12 continued the same as 6/11. Patient began alternating Advil 200 mg with Tylenol every four hours. Advil didn&#39;t seem to help any more than the Tylenol did.  Parent called consulting nurse and was advised to take patient to urgent care where she received anti-nausea medication.  Monday 6/13 patient continues to have difficulty with food and drink. The phenergan meds help with nausea but make patient so tired, there&#39;s little chance to get patient to eat or drink. Vomiting has stopped but diarrhea continues.

                                                After the second dose she had immediate pain at the injection site and over the next 24 hours she developed: A fever of 101.4 severe abdominal pain and chest pain that made her feel like her heart was being pulled out painful electric shocks down her neck and spine that made her walk hunched over numbness and swelling in the arm she got the shot pain in her fingers and toes that turned white and were ice cold to the touch  Over the next 2.5 months her abdominal, muscle and nerve pain became unbearable plus she developed new symptoms:  Fatigue gastroparesis, nausea and vomiting Eventually she couldn?t even swallow food or liquids without immediately spitting it up. An itchy rash on her arms  peeling skin on her feet Her menstrual cycle lasted a month with large clumps of blood   She had unexplained painful cysts vision problems headaches erratic blood pressure and heart rate memory loss, mixing up words and brain fog Dizziness, fainting and then nonepileptic seizures that we suspect were from lyrica verbal and motor tics loss of feeling from the waist down, muscle weakness, abnormal gait and eventually she wasn?t able to walk at all urinary retention  From the day she got her 2nd dose to today we took her to the ER nine (9) times and she was admitted to the hospital a total of 3 times totalling 2 months. The last time she was admitted to the hospital she could not walk, was unable to feel or move below her waist,  threw up anything she tried to eat or drink, had tachycardia and her blood sugar was at 47.  Once she got an NG tube and was stable they transferred her to Inpatient Rehabilitation and she was just discharged on June 1st. Today she is able to walk with a walker and take care of herself but she still has little to no feeling below her waist.  She still has an NG tube for nutrition and continues to have GI and urinary retention problems.

On HD#3, she had another episode of hematemesis after eating solids. Overnight, tolerated liquids and solids without any further episodes of emesis.

Mom reported to pharmacist staff that patient turned pale and felt dizzy. Pharmacist suggested patient to drink water and continued to rest while pharmacist monitored patient. Pharmacist tried to take patient&#39;s blood pressure but pharmacy didn&#39;t have the right cuff so she was  unable to obtain patient&#39;s blood pressure. Patient then was sweating and mom continued to give her water while pharmacist checked patient&#39;s temperature (recorded 94.6&#39;F). Few minutes later, patient vomited. Mom gave patient water after she was done vomiting. Patient reported she felt better afterwards. Patient was monitored for about 15 minutes and she was able to walk herself and left the pharmacy waiting area with mother. Pharmacist suggested mother to call doctor for follow up advice.

                                                Patient was a 12 year old female with a weight of 94 lbs who came into the clinic with her father for her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. During the interview, she stated that she did not have any adverse effects with her first dose. At 2:45 pm, after administering her second dose of 0.3 ml of Pfizer vaccine, I witnessed her having trouble standing up and assisted her back down into the seat. She vomited, was pale and diaphoretic. We elevated her legs up onto a bench and began fluid resuscitation. Her first BP was 71/55 and respiratory rate was unlabored. At 3:00 pm her second vitals were BP: 82/69, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 98, HR: 80.  At 3:07 pm her third vitals were BP:83/64, RR: unlabored, SPO2: 99, HR:74. We changed her position from legs elevated to 90 degree angle. Fluids and crackers were still being administered. At 3:16 pm her fourth vitals were BP: 94/76, RR; unlabored, SPO2: 85, HR 67.  At 3:30 pm her final vital signs were BP: 96/74, RR: 14, SPO2: 99, HR: 70. The patient was given a total of 60 oz of fluid and 1 pack of crackers.  I reassessed that the patient&#39;s hemodynamic status improved and her skin was warm and dry. The patient was alert and oriented throughout the process. Her father stated that she no longer looked pale. She was brought to the observation room for another 15 minutes and her father was informed about the progression of her condition. He was informed to refer to her pediatrician if there were any other adverse effects related to the vaccine or changes in her condition.

                                                6/12 - patient developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. Worsened gradually with difficulty swallowing. 6/16 - presented to ED. Patient also reported rash in right lower extremity that is pruritic, 2 episodes of non-bloody non-bilious emesis daily since Saturday, intermittent chest pain and dyspnea, myalgias, diarrhea, generalized abdominal pain, and neck pain. Concern for infectious mononucleosis with lymphadenitis. Prescribed Augmentin and discharged home. 6/17 - returned to ED due to worsening rash (no longer pruritic) and diarrhea. Continued fever and neck pain. Hypotensive requiring 3L bolus and norepi. Large volume diarrhea. Mild AKI that resolved with fluid resuscitation. Treated broadly with antibiotics for toxic shock syndrome but rash was not consistent and cultures were negative, so eventually narrowed to ampicillin-sulbactam. Neck pain and swelling improved, but fever persisted through 6/19. Transferred to the floor on 6/20 and gradually improved without further intervention. Antibiotics were continued to target possible tonsillitis/lymphadenitis, but course did not seem to be truly responding to these antibiotics. CRP continued to increase despite antibiotics. Patient&#39;s presentation seemed most consistent with MIS-C; she also met criteria for incomplete KD with fever, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy and lab abnormalities, but this was felt less likely and she was not treated with IVIG or any other anti-inflammatories. Patient eventually improved and was discharged home 6/24.

                                                With the first dose: Headache (came and went frequently) dizzy(2-3 days) nausea (2-3 days) sore arm (3-4 days) gave ibuprofen for about 2 days and most symptoms went away. She continued to complain about a headache every once in awhile. About a week later I noticed  her eyes seemed a little yellow but it didn&#39;t seem to get worse and thought maybe she just need to drink more water and get some sleep.  After second dose: Bad headache (3-4 days) dizzy and nauseous (3 days) gave ibuprofen for 2 days. Two days after the vaccine she was fully jaundice. Hadn&#39;t notice because she was feeling bad from the vaccine so I just let her sleep mostly. Next day we got into see her primary care dr who ordered stat bloodwork and stat ultrasound. That same day she got some blood work back and told us to go to the er because her platelets were really low. At the er they diagnosed her with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which explained the jaundice. She was admitted and put on steroids. Her hemoglobin got as low as 5 and they cross matched her incase they needed to do a blood transfusion. They were concerned that there was a possibility that her immune system would attack the donor blood since it seemed to be attacking her platelets as well. Luckily the steroids started working and he levels creeped up a little. She also recieved 3 vitamin k transfusions and pain meds. When she was switched to oral steroids and her numbers were still rise they released her. She is still taking steroids and has weekly follow ups with Dr. . We are also in the process of getting a rheumatology referral to see if there is an underlying condition we didnt know about.

                                                My daughter experienced on day of her 2nd vaccine, feel nauseated in the evening time, then the second day. Felt very lethargic, fatigue, laying in bed all day, sleeping. She still had nausea also experienced chills, highest temp 99.8F. Her arm pit on the right side where she got the vaccine was really sore. She basically like within a couple of days she started her period cycle again and it was very heavy and lasted one week and half almost two weeks. On 06-08-2021, at about 10pm, she was brushing her teeth when she saw black spots and she went to tell me. At about 11:30pm that night, she squatted to pat our dog and when she got up and she felt really dizzy, lightheaded so I got concerned. Her symptoms persisted and I scheduled an appointment with her pediatrician on 06-15-2021. The pediatrician ruled out anemia. Her pediatrician said she has Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. Her pediatrician said that this is something manageable, she needs to strengthen her calf muscles and drink lots of water. They monitored her heart pressure and blood pressure.  Her heart rate had increased to 40bpm.  I also gave her Ibuprofen medication after the vaccine. Leading to today she has been having dizziness and light headiness every single day. My daughter is still  experiencing  symptoms, dizzy and light headed today.   For her 1st vaccine- within few days after her 1st dose, she experienced when using the treadmill, she would feel very dizzy. I did not think anything of it at first and this happened three times then it stopped. She also had a sore arm.

She had pressure behind her eyes, muscle pain,she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills , sore throat, nauseous, caller states she was assuming hives, inflammation stayed around awhile , body aches / pain through her head and back down her neck, trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful , she was slumpy, swelling from the digging and scratching, her hands began to swell yesterday in Jun2021. she woke up and said her face felt funny on 09Jun202. she was just not feeling right and couldn&#39;t walk by herself on Jun2021, Caller relays her daughter will be (withheld) . HCP: Caller states she called the pediatrician office and 1 was by phone and she was seen by this provider yesterday and she encouraged her to reach out to us as well. Mom states she was aware of the possible symptoms to occur and her daughter came home Tuesday perfectly fine and went to bed and woke up with the typical symptoms, she had not slept, fever, headache, the chills, sore throat, nauseous and had all the symptoms pretty much. States she didn&#39;t have anything weird going on during the observation time the day of the vaccine. Caller relays her daughter didn&#39;t have anything weird after her 1st dose. Caller states she took a nap Wednesday about 24 hours after her 2nd dose and she woke up and her lips had begun to swell and she woke up and said her face felt funny and it was itchy. Caller states she was assuming hives. Caller states that there was nothing concerning as it wasn&#39;t in that initial 15minutes to 4 hour and that this occurs 24 hours after and that was a concern. Caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch and that was kind of along the same lines and said hives and she would itch itch itch and there was swelling from the digging and scratching. Caller states she has numbness in her lip with the swelling. Caller states the other symptoms that are bizarre is more yesterday and it started some on Wednesday she had a pressure in her chest and this was a child, her daughter was very strong, she got up yesterday and tried to do school and had a fever of 102 and Wednesday evening was so sick with symptoms and she still tried. Caller states the pressure in her chest is concerning and told them yesterday and she needed to be seen. States her daughter described it to the doctor that it felt like someone was sitting on her chest sort of pressure and on a scale of 1-10 she was a 7. Caller provides that not at any time did she experience trouble breathing and she never saw her lose or get weird coloring. Caller states she called her doctor Wednesday afternoon and talked to another doctor, that she called the help line after hours as they close 4:30 or 5pm. States she was told it was good news that she did not have trouble breathing but to have it at this point was weird and no one knows what to expect and everyone is different. States she was told to do Benadryl and continue with pain medication for fever and discomfort. Caller states her daughter was miserable the rest of the evening. Caller relays that the swelling subsided and the inflammation stayed around awhile and yesterday she woke up better with no nausea and the common symptoms are better and she still had the fever. Caller relays that at about 9:00 she began to have a problem where she said that behind her eyes she had significant pressure and that scared the caller what with the brain and swelling. Caller states her hands began to swell yesterday, like her lip and her fingers are itchy and swelling and it&#39;s constant itching and the pressure on her chest yesterday, that those 3 things freaked the caller out and she called the pediatrician and they said to have her checked out to make sure as nobody wanted to rush her to the ER as she was not struggling to breathe she was just not feeling right. Caller states the pediatrician did her research about heart inflammation and listened to her heart a couple of times and said her best observation for rubbing sounds was she did not hear any. Caller states when her daughter was younger she had meningitis and went through a whole lot with that and caller states she does not immediately rush to the hospital as that brings back emotions with that. Caller states the doctor said she didn&#39;t see any immediate distress and would do an EKG or they could wait and see, that she thought the pressure might be like body aches and her daughter had laid in bed all day the day before and had a time with it. Caller states she couldn&#39;t walk by herself and she was out of it. Caller states she could do the EKG or wait until today and they chose to wait. States that today she seems better and the only thing today is the continuing pressure behind her eyes that her daughter described as it felt like someone had 2 spoons and was trying to push her eyeballs out and it is really painful. Caller relays her daughter has been through meningitis pain and has pain through her head and back down her neck and the concern is swelling. Caller states it could be a weird reaction and the doctor thinks it is a weird headache she is having and is still doing ibuprofen. Caller relays that her chest is not nearly as heavy today and she has taken Benadryl again for itching and swelling. States the doctor says they don&#39;t know what did it because the risk was there and the benefit and don&#39;t want to get reactions. Caller states she had no problem with getting the shot, that weird things happen and the pediatrician is saying it can happen but doesn&#39;t know. States it is kind of scary. Caller states they checked her out and they checked her oxygen and blood pressure and that made the caller feel better. States that 9:30-10 last night after she got home she was slumpy and her head was hurting and she had chest pressure. Caller states with the hand swelling, that the caller herself went through reaction and hives and the doctor had asked if her daughter had anything new introduced and no nothing was and her daughter didn&#39;t seem concerned to share this but after her 1st dose her hands itched and she didn&#39;t pay it any mind. States she had no face swelling. Caller states she is wondering if those little hand itches after the 1st dose she didn&#39;t tell about till now was that a little bit of a sign that something else was there. States she didn&#39;t mention it after the 1st dose and was good to go. States after the 2nd dose she said mommy my hands itched after the 1st dose, her lip didn&#39;t swell and she told the doctor it&#39;s not conditions on the list of symptoms and she didn&#39;t have breathing issues. Caller states it&#39;s a non severe reaction and is assuming to dose and said yesterday if she gets a booster what does Pfizer advise. Caller states they have all intention of getting what she needs in the future. Caller states she wants to make sure she doesn&#39;t have worse and the lip swelling was freaky. Caller states she thought her daughter was out of the woods after the 20 minutes waiting and was home and then turned. Caller states it was pretty straight forward and knew what the expected symptoms were and they were fine and knew she was having the exact ones on the list and was not feeling well and had a fever. States she was thrown for a loop when others came up and the fact that they were 24 hours out, that she got the 2nd dose 4-4:15 on Tuesday and these evolved well after that time. Caller said they said to report this and her hope is that they can help if someone else has this issue. States when she said she was laying there my hands did itch after the 1st but not like this to this degree. States she never said anything and caller didn&#39;t know. States she knows as a parent there are certain questions to ask and warning signs of potential allergic reactions. Caller states she is assuming this is some sort of allergic reaction, not the worst kind but pressure in the chest and other concerns about her heart having some sort of issue she knows have been reported.Caller states that today she could have done the EKG for more information but based on her listening and what she wanted to thinking the body aches and extensive issues with that she is glad she waited. States she was laying in bed at 6:30 and asked her if she wanted to get the EKG and she said she was afraid of going to the hospital and it&#39;s not fun but would give answers if there is something else and she laid in bed until 9:30-10 and gave her more Benadryl and Ibuprofen and continued with that for the discomfort behind her eyes and the doctor is thinking it&#39;s body aches. States the fever subsided yesterday.Caller states she would like to share that her daughter is a tough kid and tough kids can be taken down too and may not pay attention. Caller states she doesn&#39;t over react but she is aware and if she had told her about her hands she would have thought allergic reaction, mild one and brought her to the doctor or at the 2nd vaccine and she didn&#39;t say anything until after the fact. Caller relays her daughter has never been through hives and the caller has and has a lot of seasonal and environmental allergies and the caller was that kid. Caller states with her daughter not having seen her lip swell and her eyes started hurting and she started thinking the worst. States the doctor pushed on her and checked her lymph nodes and did a thorough exam that lasted about 30 minutes and nobody knows. States she appreciates all that Pfizer and the other companies have done, that we need this.Caller states her daughter goes to the pediatrician in 2 weeks for her annual check up. States the doctor yesterday said her body responded and had a hard time with it. States she does the flu shot every year and this was weird and she wanted us to know and hopes this report can help. Caller states her daughter is a tough kid nobody knows and today she is better, she has a headache behind her eyes still there.Caller relays that Friday she had her annual eye check up and it&#39;s not a vision thing, that was fine until Wednesday and other other stuff and yesterday with pressure and she is sure it&#39;s residual and her body adjusting and if she can help with letting other people know.Caller relays if it comes back she is going to do the EKG, that she is not the parent to say it is nothing and will follow through with Pfizer also. Caller states she didn&#39;t have anything weird for heart beat and no rubbing sound and no signs and she thinks it was issues from body aches and hopefully she is on the up and up and nobody will have to leave and go to the doctor today. And didn&#39;t think because it was not an immediate issue with her breathing and nothing like that and didn&#39;t think it would be an issue with a booster. Caller states it could be that instead of sitting for 20 minutes they keep her longer and that when she fills out the sheet if was not an option, she knows there is severe reaction listed, she will make notes and make the person giving the dose aware that she had the delayed what they are believing to be allergic reaction and make sure, that she may never have it again and it could have been her system was so under attack. Caller states she doesn&#39;t understand vaccines and knows it&#39;s the body&#39;s job to do something and she is not reluctant helping her be immune and she understands what to do in the event and doesn&#39;t have an epi pen and her daughter has no allergies and no reactions to anything. Caller states she didn&#39;t have the worry, that there is always a chance and you worry when something foreign goes in the body that there is a chance to react. Investigations: Caller states they listened to her heart and took her vitals and tests with her fingers checking her eyes to make sure her pupils were dilating correctly and move her eyes with a moving finger. Caller states she doesn&#39;t know the medical term but the basics and let them know she was not in dire straights to rush to the hospital immediately. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement, body temperature: 102 fahrenheit, electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation, vital signs measurement was unknown and unspecified date. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of lip swelling and numbness, itching on face, hands and feet / caller states then her daughters hands and feet began to itch, pressure on her chest , fever, swelling from the digging and scratching. The outcome of the events was unknown.

She has this fear that someone is gong to jump off and attack her; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer. This consumer (patient&#39;s mother) reported for a 12-year-old female patient (reporter&#39;s daughter) that: A 12-years-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (Solution injection; Batch/Lot Number: EW0181; Expiration Date: Aug2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 18Jun2021 at 09:15 as single dose (at the age of 12-years-old) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included PFAPA syndrome, fever, and redness at the injection site. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient did not take any prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. On 18Jun2021, in the evening, patient had pain in arm, nausea, headache, fatigue and malaise. Reporter stated that, three days after receiving the vaccine, her daughter began seeing a scary image of a very distorted, grotesque person. She was afraid to walk alone in the hallway even during the day. Caller reported that it has gotten better, at least during the day. Caller reported that the patient doesn&#39;t tell her about the image, but the patient knows it&#39;s not real and not there. Caller reported that the patient says that she cannot shake this feeling of fear that something is going to jump out at her or attack her. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s feeling of fear comes and goes. Caller reported that what has gotten better it seems is during the day. Caller reported that the patient said that when she is busy or distracted, she doesn&#39;t think about it, but if the patient has more time on her hands she starts to go there. Caller reported that the patient is having kind of like this feeling, not necessarily paranoia, but a feeling like something is going to happen or jump out at her and she can&#39;t shake it. Caller reported that the patient knows that it is not real and not there. Caller reported that the patient received the Covid-19 vaccine because of school as they are not going to have a virtual option, as well as just to be safe and be able to travel. Caller reported that on night of 30Jun2021 was a little better but was a little worse at night on 01Jul2021. Caller reported that the patient was home schooled and was fully fine. Caller reported that the patient&#39;s grades were excellent and that she was happy to be home but missed her friends. Caller reported that this was very bizarre to her and that the patient&#39;s pediatrician advised the caller to call Pfizer and not to give the patient the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Caller reported that although the patient&#39;s physician hadn&#39;t heard anything, she wanted to ask if Pfizer had heard anything. Caller stated that she reported the event to VAERS as well and made a submission. Caller stated that she does not know if Pfizer can give her that information or not but she just didn&#39;t know if this is something Pfizer has seen. On 19Jun2021, pain in arm, fatigue, nausea, headache and malaise was resolved. The outcome of She is afraid to walk alone in the hallway. She has this fear that someone is going to jump off and attack her and began seeing a scary image of a very distorted, grotesque person was unknown.  Follow up attempts are needed. Further information has been requested.

Then, on 7/12/21, she started to experience pain, redness, and some swelling again but this time there was some pain on the right side as well. Pain originating from deltoid and radiating through arms and shoulders. On 7/16/21 the pain was worsening and she was no longer able to perform daily activities as well as would cry if her arms were even slightly touched. she was referred to the Urgent Care who did testing for illness and muscle conditions which came back normal. She was screaming through trying to get bloodwork due to the pain which is atypical for her and they sent us to the ER for pain with unknown origin. ER physician said all neurological processes were normal and was concerned for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome so he wanted an urgent follow-up with Primary Care. on 7/19/21 Primary Care suggested delayed response to the vaccine and referred her to Neurology. On 7/22/21 Neurology decided it was a delayed immune response to the Covid vaccine and prescribed Prednisone to start today 7/23/21.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine around 11:20am, and started feeling bad within about 5-7 minutes of administration.  Her grandmother came to the counter to alert me that she wasn&#39;t feeling well, patient was lightheaded and just &#34;felt bad&#34;.  She did say she was nauseous, but was very agitated and had trouble verbalizing what was wrong.  She was very hot and clammy, her mother reported that she looked very pale.  I went to get a cuff to take her blood pressure, but by the time I got it on her arm, she was slumping significantly in the chair, so we decided to move her back to the clinic room to lay her down and elevate her feet.  Her mother and I each took an arm to move her.  I thought she may have briefly lost consciousness, her legs were not holding any of her weight, but her head was down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was alert.  We moved her a few more feet into the room and her mother moved to set her down in a chair, she was talking and alert.  At this time, her bladder evacuated and she vomited, her mom moved her the rest of the way to the chair. I immediately went back to the room with them and dialed 911 at 11:34am.  She was more alert at this time, did not report any difficulty breathing or any swelling or itching of the mouth or throat.  She was very anxious/agitated, but she did say that she felt a little better after vomiting.   EMS arrived at 11:52, I believe she vomited again before they got here, she did take a few sips of water.  EMS left at 12:06pm, the patient and her mother left at 12:07, she was walking on her own, with support from mom.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Pt received vaccine (1st dose, Pfizer lot #EW0185) at 9:42 am and was seated in observation area. Patient raised hand and told observation/charge nurse her stomach hurt and she wanted to use the restroom. When asked to describe pain, pt stated she felt a little nauseous. The pt also stated she felt sick before getting the vaccine. The nurse accompanied to the patient to the restroom, and pt used the toilet. When pt came out of the stall, the nurse asked if she was feeling better. Pt stated her stomach still hurt, and she wanted to go to the school nurse&#39;s office. Charge nurse escorted pt to school nurse&#39;s office. The nurse stated &#34;oh, we know her,&#34; and told charge nurse pt had frequent abd pain. Charge nurse left pt in care of school nurse and returned to vaxxing area. Nurse who administered vax to pt stated to charge nurse that the pt told her her stomach was hurting when she asked if she was well, and that it was an &#34;ongoing thing,&#34; and she was getting an ultrasound for it Friday. Pt had no fever and no other complaints, but stated she was &#34;only getting the vaccine because my grandmother wants me to.&#34; One-half hour later, school nurse came to auditorium asking if charge nurse could speak to pt&#39;s GM. Per school nurse, pt&#39;s GM had picked pt up from school d/t stomach complaint and now was on the phone with a question about vax SEs. Charge nurse spoke with GM on the phone. Per GM, pt had vomited x 1 and her ears were &#34;very red.&#34; GM stated pt had recent issues w/ vomiting, but was concerned that pt&#39;s ears were red. GM denied any itching, rash, SOB, voice changes, dizziness, redness or weals anywhere else, or other symptoms of concern. Advised GM to give pt benadryl following dosing instructions on bottle, give her small sips of water and bland food as tolerated, and monitor pt at home. If pt&#39;s condition worsened, GM should take pt to UC/ED immediately for assessment. GM agreed w/ plan of care.  At 2:30 pm, the school health director emailed the school site coordinator and told her the &#34;student had an adverse reaction after today?s vaccination. She is currently in the emergency room and the docs believe it is definitely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. ....She did speak with your NP who was on-site this morning after she was dismissed to home, and advised to take Benadryl. Symptoms worsened and she went to ER where she received 2 doses of epi.&#34; Charge nurse reached out to school health director for information on where pt was treated to call for a report of symptoms prompting the epi intervention, but had not received a reply at the time of this report.

Went to the Doctor and she said it looked like an allergic rash. She told us that based on my daughter&#39;s genetics and her asthma -  (I (her mother) had an anaphylaxis with my second Moderna shot  - my entire body was giant hives.)- That he did not recommend her to have the 2nd shot. My daughter still has some of the rash - a little on her left cheek, stomach and back still. The itching is gone. She did take Benadryl for it.

I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis. As of today my daughter still has nausea that comes and goes and also continues with the headaches and takes Ibuprofen as pain medication.

She wasn&#39;t talking much, she started gagging and fainted again and her body started convulsing.  We believe she was having a seizure.  Patient has never had a seizure, her fever was high.  It only lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  When she stopped, she was able to walk with assistance back to her room.  We quickly gave her some medicine to bring down her fever.  Wet wash cloth and a fan on her.  I failed to take her temperature.  I was too concerned at what was going on.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

She went back to bed but then woke up and at 06:00 am threw up again. She said she hadn&#39;t been able to poop for 2-3 days. Docusate for constipation on Friday and she went twice but she told me yesterday that she hasn&#39;t gone again since that time. Has not received more than the one dosage of the Docusate. Dr. gave her sublingual med for throwing up but we haven&#39;t filled it as her nausea is gone.

Patient was given a box of apple juice and a few minutes after patient felt much better, was no longer dizzy, weak or nauseated. Patient left area with mother after returning back to feeling normal.

A 13-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/Lot Number: EW0191, Expiration Date: 13Jun2021), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in left hand on 13Jun2021 as 1st dose, single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

                                                Patient said she felt immediate, strong pain in her arm from the jab the nurse gave her.  She said the needle was in her arm a lot longer than when she received her first shot.   I also watched patient receive her first COVID shot from a different provider, different facility, and I was surprised by the force of the jab of this second COVID shot, and length of time the needle was in her arm.  After the nurse left us in the room to wait 15 minutes, patient became more and more uncomfortable, hot, sweaty and nauseous.  Within 5 minutes, she was lying down on the exam table - at which time I alerted staff at the nurse&#39;s station in hallway that patient wasn&#39;t well and we needed help.  She said she would get &#34;the provider&#34; and be right in.  When I walked back into the room, patient was curled up in a ball on the table, pale, clammy and not able to speak.  I yelled down the hallway for help right away, and stepped back into the room.  Patient then began to vomit.  At least two nurses entered the room, and began to assess her vitals.  Her blood pressure was low, but she was breathing fine.  &#39;The provider&#34; (I don&#39;t know his name) came in and I told him about how hard she was jabbed, and that she began to feel badly immediately afterward.

                                                Patient is a 13-year-old who was transferred from another hospital for chest pain in the setting of Covid vaccination.   She received her second dose of Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday, June 29.  On Wednesday she developed fatigue chest pain shortness of breath weakness, nausea and mild abdominal pain.  She also had a fever to 102.5 Fahrenheit.  mom is a nurse and took her pulse and felt that it was 30 and fast.  She then took 1 with her home equipment it was in the 120s.  She called her neighbor who took her pulse and it was in the 130s.  She then transferred her to another Hospital for further care at hospital her vital sinus evaluation was a temperature of 37.4 pulse 119 respiratory rate is 15 blood pressure 106/62 satting 98% on room air.  On exam she was well appearing with tenderness to palpation of sternum heart rate normal rate and rhythm lungs clear bilaterally and abdominal exam benign. they obtain CBC with white count of 4.8 hemoglobin 12.9 Camm that was unremarkable LFTs are within normal limits troponin that was negative BNP 223 with a normal upper limit of 125 ESR 2 D-dimer 0.697 with upper limit of normal 0.5 and a CRP of 9 with upper limit of normal of 8.1.  UA bland. She was given Toradol for chest pain EKG with sinus tachycardia .  She was given 1/2 L normal saline bolus ondansetron Toradol and started on maintenance IV fluids of D5 NS.  She was then transferred to another hospital for further care .    Upon arrival here she notes improvement in her energy level and all of her pain except for her chest pain.  She describes it as a pressure on top of her chest that is right in the center and is worse with movement and deep breaths.   Of note she had a appendectomy a few years ago that was complicated by surgeons making the bowel and then required her to have a bowel resection.  She has no dietary restrictions and eats by mouth, no GI complications in the long-term.     PMH: as above  PSH: No significant past surgical history  FH: Reviewed and noncontributory to current presentation  SH: Lives with caregivers   Meds: None  Allergies: No known drug allergies  Immunizations: UTD   Review of Systems       Constitutional:  fever, no chills, no sweats,  fatigue Skin: no rash, no lesions,  Eye: no redness ENMT: no ear pain, no sore throat, no congestion, no hoarseness  Respiratory: &#43; shortness of breath, no cough, no wheezing  Cardiovascular: &#43; chest pain, no palpitations,  Gastrointestinal: &#43; nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no GI bleeding  Genitourinary: no dysuria, no hematuria,  Musculoskeletal:  &#43; muscle pain,  Neurologic: no headache, no dizziness, no numbness, no weakness  Psychiatric: no sleeping problems,  Allergy/Immunologic: no recurrent infections,  Additional ROS info: All other systems of a 10 system review are negative.  Briefly, patient is presenting with chest pain, myalgias, and fever in setting of recent covid vaccine (2nd dose Pfizer 2 days ago).  Seen at an outside hospital where labs were notable for mildly elevated BNP and D-dimer, negative troponin, normal LFTs and chemistries.  Chest x-ray reportedly negative.  EKG with T wave inversions in V1 through V4 (read as nonspecific ST changes by their physician), but otherwise normal.  Given the possibility of post Covid vaccine myocarditis or PE, transferred for further management.  Patient states that after Toradol that she received the outside hospital all of her other symptoms have resolved but she continues to have chest pain.     My exam showed: Gen: tired but nontoxic appearing, no acute distress, alert and active; HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, normal conjunctiva, neck supple without LAN; Chest: significant reproducible chest pain; Card: RRR, no murmur, good perfusion, brisk radial pulses bilaterally; Lungs: CTAB, good air entry, no increased WOB; Abd: soft, non-tender, non-distended, no masses; Ext: warm and well perfused, moving all extremities; Skin: no rashes     Chest pain. Overall well appearing with normal exam with reproducible tenderness.  Given recent Covid vaccine, must consider myocarditis, although only mildly elevated BNP and negative troponin at the outside hospital are reassuring, especially given reproducible pain and reassuring EKG.  Symptoms then may represent musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or myositis related to vaccination.  Less likely pneumonia or pneumothorax, but possible.  Low suspicion for PE given lack of persistent tachycardia (tachycardia improved while in ED, currently HR 80s) or hypoxia. EKG obtained which showed T wave inversions in V1-V4 (normal for age).  Bedside ultrasound with normal global function and lack of pericardial effusion.  Labs obtained in BCH ED notable for negative BNP and troponin, along with reassuring lipase given abdominal pain.  Thus, unlikely to be true myocarditis, more likely musculoskeletal etiology such as costochondritis or chest wall pain.  Cardiology will discuss with mom for reassurance.  Final Diagnosis  1. Chest pain R07.9 2. Fever R50.9 3. Fatigue R53.83 4. Shortness of breath R06.00  PLEASE NOTE:  Since the patient is not from here, we do not have access to her vaccination records and cannot supply lot number, etc.

We laid her on the floor and elevated her legs, then she started feeling better. The paramedics came. BP was 90/48. when they left her BP was 101/60. Her parents decided to take her home for observation. I called them at 7:58pm and mom said she was perfectly fine. Vaccine given at 4:55, paramedics left at 5:20.

A 13-year-old female patient received BNT162B2(PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, solution for injection, Batch/Lot number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 20May2021(at the age of 13-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported.it was reported that Complainant hung up abruptly/transfer incomplete. Reporter stated that I am just reporting a reaction my daughter had to the shot. It was the Pfizer Covid vaccine. On 20May2021, she had abdominal cramping and then her throat started hurting and started tightening. Her weight is approximately 135 pounds and she&#39;s probably 5&#39;5. Product details and pharmacy details could not be probed as the caller hung up abruptly. Call back was done to gather further information however it was unsuccessful. Hence limited information available over the call. The outcome of the events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

Her skin color becamee gray, her lips turned blue. The seizure last approximately 20 seconds and when she came out of it she was able to breathe but said her throat felt funny, scratchy, smaller - but she was still able to breathe. She was nauseous, head hurt and was very disoriented for approximately 20-30 minutes. The pharmacist called 911. 911 arrived and took her blood, did a multitude to tests which all came out ok. We opted not to take her to the hospital as she was breathing ok, and her color was returning.

After about 5 minutes of sitting in the chair for her 15 minute observation, her mom said she felt nauseous and like she was going to pass out.  She was laid her back in the chair.  The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

                                                Patient while sitting in the post-vaccination are, fainted in her chair. Upon my immediate arrival, I tapped the patient and she was coming to consciousness. Patient upon awakening, felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, but barely did. I gave the patient water and sports drink and the patient was regaining normalcy. Both the patient and her guardian reported that she did not eat or drink anything prior to coming to the vaccine appointment and that she was very nervous and worried prior. Patient denied history of fainting. I recommended to have the patient sit for at least another 15-20 minutes, but the parent stated his daughter was fine and decided to leave.

She was offered water and hard candy while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. She took a small amount of each, but declined anything else from the store. She seemed to be in significant distress and had difficulty moving to the immunization room where she would be out of view from others in the store. Parmedics arrived and checked her vitals and said those looked ok, so they didn&#39;t seem concerned. Patient still seemed very unsteady when leaving, but did say that her vision had improved. Patients were advised to keep a very close eye on her.

She was sitting up in a chair during this time, with her mom holding her up.  She came to, the about 20 seconds later, she passed out again for another 10 seconds.  She came to, and was given some water to drink, but 20 seconds after that she threw up the water.  I took her blood pressure, and it was 60/40, with a pulse of 60.  She was very pale.  After resting in the chair and taking deep breaths, her color returned and she felt much better.  she also said her vision wasn&#39;t blurry anymore.  Ten minutes later, she left with her mom, feeling ok.  She was very anxious about getting the shot, and told me she had passed out in the pass after giving blood.

                                                My daughter was receiving her second vaccine about 1230pm  and while administered she immediately told me she felt ?dizzy and nauseous.? We sit down, she is not feeling better and within 3 minutes or so she said she felt? dizzy and feel like I?m going to throw up.? She then starts nodding off and on, not able to keep her eyes open. I waved over for help and by the time volunteers got to her she went limo and passes out. She was taken by wheelchair to medic room and they had her lay down. She came alert and said ?everything went black? and had no memory/recollection or awareness of where she was and how she got to the medic room. We gave her water and I asked for crackers and she felt better and was able to leave around 115pm.  In addition, we saw a teenage male pass out prior to my daughter and was also taken by wheelchair. I spoke with a RN as I was leaving and was told multiple teens had had the same initial reaction today.  She had no reactions or side effects with her first dose.

                                                On sunday night, about 36 hours after vaccination, she started to have numbness of her lower jaw and tongue. She started to have an incredible amount of drooling and could not swallow. She then started to have epigastric cramping and sharp abdominal pain that moved into the right lower quadrant. She had pretty severe headache that started the same time as numbness and drooling with photosensitivity. No fever. No vomiting but she was nauseous.  she went to the ER late on 6/13.  She was then transferred to the hospital for furthur care. She had a neurology consult that thought perhaps her headache, numbness and drooling could have been an atypical migraine-this resolved as of 6/14.  Her abdominal pain resolved after appendectomy and now she just has muscular pain related to surgery.

                                                6/19/21 patient awoke with non-bloody, bright green emesis and abdominal pain. She endorses several episodes of nonbloody diarrhea with continued abdominal pain.  She endorses starting her menstrual period 3 days ago. Mom endorses fever at this time, T-max 102.9.  Presented to an urgent care for further evaluation where they obtained a rapid strep test and COVID-19 swab that were both negative. 6/21/21 she presented to an ED for continued and worsening symptoms.  She received a dose of antibiotics and saline boluses during transfer to another hospital.  In route, she became hypotensive with minimal response to fluid resuscitation. She required vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. A CT of the abdomen showed nonspecific findings for enterocolitis.  A urinalysis had 5-15 RBCs and 51-100 WBCs. She was started on antibiotics. She required ICU admission initially, but improved and became hemodynamically stable after about 16 hours in the PICU. Her urine culture grew 3 different organisms with low colony counts so antibiotics were discontinued on 6/22/21. An ECHO demonstrated normal biventricular size and systolic function (LFEF 62%), mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating mildly elevated RV pressure (30-40% systemic), mild flow accelration across normal appearing trileaflet aortic valve and borderline small aortic root and sinotubular junction, normal ascending aorta, no pericardial effusion, normal right, left main, and LAD coronary artery diameter z-score, and mild outpouching in the left main coronary artery that may represent an early appearance of an aneurysm. A repeat ECHO the following day revealed normal biventricular size and systolic function, mild tricuspid regurgitation estimating RV systolic pressure of 30mmHg, left main coronary artery appears slightly prominent but measures within normal limits. LMCA measurement is similar to previous, normal measurement of the proximal RCA and LAD, and trivial pericardial effusion. The patient also had an elevated CRP of 18.8 mg/dL, fibrinogen of 408 mg/dL, d-dimer of 0.98, and nt-pro BNP of 309. SARS CoV2 IgG was positive and IgM was negative. She received IVIG 100 gm on 6/23/21 and was started on rivaroxaban. CRP decreased to 8.2 mg/dL on 6/23/21.

                                                Patient was nervous and teary eyed in the vaccination booth, prior to administrating.  She is a minor so her Father accompanied her.  We were in the booth for a few minutes where I was trying to get her to relax and breathe.  Her father was there the entire time. I gave the Pfizer vaccine and she stated &#34;that was it?&#34;  She seemed ok upon leaving the booth.  Her and her Father sat in the observation area directly in front of the pharmacy. About 5 minutes passed when her Father tapped on the window.  Went out to check on the patient and she was pale and little disoriented.  She ended up throwing up as well. We gave her a bag so she wouldn&#39;t have to stand up and could stay near her father, to prevent a fall. ?We gave her a cold compress and a water and had her stay for 30 minutes.  By the time she left, she had her color back and was able to say that she was feeling much better.  Her father was not surprised that she had a reaction like this and stated that she usually has form of reaction like to vaccines.  She was ok by the time she left and they both stated they&#39;d be back for the second vaccine.

                                                Within 2 hours of the vaccine, patient was experiencing nausea and general feeling of unwellness. Within 3 hours, patient had a fever of 99.9. At 11 pm, patient had a fever of 100. Mother administered Tylenol and patient went to bed. Patient woke up around 4:30 am with her whole body shaking uncontrollably. Mother heard her stirring and went to check on her. Her temperature was 100. Mother sat and talked with her and offered a snack, drink, and more Tylenol. Mother checked her pulse, which was normal. Patient was coherent and able to communicate. Mother left the room to get snack and drink and heard something fall over in patient&#39;s room and Mother called out and waited a few seconds for a response. Patient did not respond. Mother went back in the room, as it was unusual for patient not to respond, and found patient sitting back up and placing her head in her hands, stating in a panicked voice that she felt she was going to throw up and that she was very hot and that her head hurt really bad. Patient stated that her ears felt weird and everything went black and she somehow fell over from a sitting position on her bed to laying on her bed and had landed on the dog. Patient was unaware that she had knocked over her water bottle and had no recollection of the loud sound it made as it fell over (unusual because loud sounds are very startling for her). The shaking subsided to a tremor a few minutes after the black out. Patient then reported feeling very cold and her temperature had risen to 101. Patient complained of an extreme headache and continued nausea. Mother took patient to Urgent Care, who performed bloodwork and an EKG, and then referred patient to the Emergency Room for an EEG.  ER repeated EKG and declined to do EEG and told patient to follow up with her doctor in 5 - 7 days.

She said she has her menstrual cycle and it has never been this bad. She said she didn&#39;t get it last month at all. Prior to this, she said her cycles were normal. She also had pain in her thighs and trouble breathing which resulted in her needing her rescue inhaler.  At this time she has been given ibuprofen and is resting with a heating pad. I as pts. mom am concerned that this may be related to vaccine.

                                                She got her vaccine, she was sitting in the chair and 4-5 minutes after the shot she started telling her grandfather that she felt nauseated.  She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

                                                After administration of vaccine the patient stood up quickly and passed out.  The patient fell down and came to rather quickly.  After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

                                                Received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday May 16,2021 at around 2:50 pm. At around 7:20 pm on May 16,2021 she stood up to walk to the bathroom. She began feeling nauseous when she stood up. While she was washing her hands, after going to the bathroom, she began to have difficulty with her vision. She describes white and blue dots obstructing her vision in both eyes. She also began to experience loud tinnitus. She described hearing multiple frequencies.  The problem with her vision and the tinnitus continued as she walked through our house to a couch where she laid down. The vision problem and tinnitus continued while she laid on the couch. Her breathing was rapid but she thinks this may have been due to the stress caused by her other symptoms. This episode lasted for several minutes and then the vision problem resolved. The tinnitus continued for several minutes after the vision problem resolved. The intensity of the tinnitus slowly decreased until it finally stopped. The following evening, she experienced tinnitus for a few minutes but it was less intense than it was the previous evening. She very rarely has experienced tinnitus in the past. She has very infrequently experienced brief episodes of orthostatic hypotension when she was dehydrated. When this event occurred, she felt like she was well hydrated. This event lasted much longer and she has never experienced this problem with her vision in the past.

I don?t believe she hit her head we didn?t see a lump. She came too right away and got nauseated and light-headed again sitting up so we took her to lay down on the stretcher. She was doing ok but laying down when I left.   The nurse that administered the immunization wrote: She got vaccinated, tolerated it well. Told her sister she barely felt it and expressed relief. Sat for a minute while in handed her mom paperwork ( vaccination card). Then got up, stood with mom and brother. Was standing one minute and went down without warning, standing next to brother and mom. I had just finished vaccinating the sister, I was putting a bandaid on her when it happened so couldn&#39;t have been more than a couple of minutes.   Dr.  observed this patient after they passed out at the vaccination clinic and subsequently released her home with the family.

Approximately 3 minutes after shot was given I was called out to the waiting room as the patient had passed out. I helped her mother lower her to the floor and by the time we lowered her down she was regaining consciousness. After about 5 minutes she was feeling better and we moved her into the immunization room to wait for EMS. EMS came and evaluated her and determined she was ok to go home

Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

                                                She got the second shot of COVID-19 shot around 3 PM on 6/3. She had a sore arm, lower fever, and headache on the second day (6/4), which was expected. On 6/5, she complained about chest congestion in the morning. She described that it felt like running after a mile. I asked her to drink more water and get some rest. The discomfort didn&#39;t get away, so I consulted her pediatrician over the phone. Her pulse and blood pressure were normal (86/103/75). She didn&#39;t feel short of breath. And her finger oximeter result was 99.  In the afternoon, she described the discomfort as after some strenuous exercise and kept putting her hand over her heart. She felt tired and didn&#39;t have a good appetite for lunch or dinner, and only ate half meals. After dinner, around 9:30, she throws up and felt a little better.  Then she took a capsule of Motrin liquid gel of 200 mg ibuprofen and went to bed. She slept well and felt OK this morning.

                                                About an hour after receiving the 2nd vaccine, she developed a pain in the upper-mid sternal area.  She&#39;s not had any pain like this in the past.  The pain remained constant ever since it started, and there don&#39;t appear to be any alleviating factors such as position changes.  Deep inspiration makes it worse.  The pain radiates at times across the upper chest and down the back.  She&#39;s had some accompanying nausea.  She&#39;s also noticed feeling a little short of breath as the day progressed, which is not necessarily related to the pain.  She denies any palpitations or dizziness.  No near syncope or syncope.  The pain remained  a maximum intensity of 10/10. She therefore presented to the ER. Diagnostic studies including labs, EKG and a CT pulmonary angiogram were performed.  Troponin returned as elevated, but without EKG changes. She was transferred at the time to the Medical Center for admission. Echocardiogram was completed and normal. Vital signs remained normal. Troponin trended down. Pain improved and she was discharged home.

The following week she had a very heavy period that lasted longer than usual with severe cramps and occasional lightheaded/dizzy spells. After her cycle ended, she continued having  brief episodes of dizziness, usually when going from sitting to standing, usually resolved quickly (after a few minutes) with rest. Over the past two weeks, the episodes have become more frequent and intense, and over the past few days episodes also include s/s of seeing spots and having blurred vision with nausea, SOB, and palpitations/tachycardia. Tonight while at lacrosse practice, pt suddenly became dizzy and felt like she might pass out, became diaphoretic and pale.

                                                My daughter received her second Pfizer vaccinations at 2:15 pm.  At 1230 at night she work up with stabbing chest pain in the center of her chest that lasted three hours.  She initially said her felt faint and couldn?t catch her breath as well as initial nausea.  Being an advanced healthcare professional, I spent five minutes of asking her questions:  did she eat something bad, did she feel like she needed and inhaler, did she need to use the restroom, checked her pulse (100bpm with palpitations), no resolve.  We live 5 minutes from hospital where we prefer to go, but my daughter didn?t think she could make the five minute ride there.  We went to ER that is around the block from us  and it was total chaos.  40 &#43; people in the waiting room to be seen. My daughter was visibly in distress, crying and couldn?t keep still because of the intense chest pain she rated a 10 out of 10.  Finally they did a 12 lead EKG.  The rolled us to the back of the waiting room.  After 15 minutes, I rolled back out to the front desk and no attention to her and her severe chest pain.  Finally I announced we were going to hospital.  The called back to us? ?Good Luck!? Got pt to hospital and the  immediately did EKG, lab work, chest x ray, urinalysis. The  chest pain became intermittent then final subsided.  The doctors ruled out pneumonia, No PE, EKG WNL, lab work fine.  The Doctor stated it was chest wall pain and gave us a NSAID prescription. I talked to my sister who is an nurse works in the vaccination clinics.  She said she has  had patients who have had bouts of pericarditis and pleurisy after the second shot.  That motivated me to google second dose Pfizer reaction in teens.  There is a rare side effect of myocarditis in the teen population after the second dose.  The publication date was June 4  the day before my daughters reaction.  I didn?t thinsk the ER physician was aware of the the possible rare side effect of myocarditis in teens.  I was happy with the care we did receive.

The second shot caused a fever of 102.5 for about 12 hours and tiredness the next day as well as throwing her into a worse flare where she had liquid stools at least 4 days with visible blood two days after the vaccination. We are still dealing with the flare, so I do not know how long it will last or if she will need steroids to get her back into remission.

When she woke up in the morning she had crampy pain in the epigastric abdominal area.  Pain is constant, worsened some with laying down and improved with sitting up.  She feels like she has some mild difficulty breathing when she is lying flat.  She has not been able to eat much because eating makes her feel like her stomach is going to explode.  She is barely keeping down much water due to pain. She denies any nausea or vomiting.

A 15-years-old non pregnant female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 15May2021 16:00 (Batch/Lot Number: EW0182) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included no other illness. There were no concomitant medications. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine and any other medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient previously received Amoxicillin, Azithromicin, Cefdinir, Gardasil(Pf) and had allergy. The patient had Nausea that does not go away with Gardasil. She also received HPV vaccine previously and experienced nausea and the dizziness for a month. Reporter stated, &#34;she did not have any allergic &#39;condition&#39; (not clear) but she was allergic, she had always had a rash when she had this Amoxicillin this antibiotic. She was allergic to Penicillin.&#34; The patient had the COVID Pfizer Vaccine on 15May2021 and as soon as she had her first dose she started to feel nausea and dizziness and from there 5 days later she had, she felt a terrible headache, &#39;this heaviness&#39; (not clarified), headache, dizziness, palpitation. The reporter took her to the emergency room, they did all the test and they didn&#39;t really see anything in the results. From there she cannot stop to have nausea and dizziness and clogged throat so the reporter had to give allergy medication to her every day. She did have, she never had an allergic reaction to any vaccine but the HPV vaccine (captured as unspecified vaccine in tab) what was similar to what she is experiencing now. She had nausea and the dizziness for a month that she couldn&#39;t stay in school and she has this nausea and dizziness and clogged throat she has to run for this allergy medication what normally she never needed. So, she doesn&#39;t want to take this second dose and the reporter was wondering if it is Pfizer because she was just like (Height), a (Weight) pounds if because the reporter understand the vaccine is one for everybody, isn&#39;t this strong for a kid with that height that weight, that you do not needed the second dose. The patient could not she said she will not because she goes to school and she feel the nausea and dizziness and so. The reporter would like to report it because it maybe Pfizer&#39;s that she was thinking that 1 dose would be enough for kids. When asked about the start of experiencing adverse events, the reported stated that &#34;Well the nausea and dizziness, she was a little bit not sure about like headache right after like her we stayed there like half hours because the doctor said to stay there because she has her reaction to which but then we just the reporter felt the nausea and everything was so bright you know, the reporter had the same effect but her went away and the patient after we received she was, the whole day but not too bad, 5 days after then she but she was already with this nausea, dizziness and 5 days after she got the palpitation, bad headache, nausea, dizziness and then I took her to the emergency room.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;No they have improved, the only thing now left is every day she has this nausea, dizziness and then she said about dizziness and then nausea and then clogged throat and then the reporter gave her the &#39;allergic pill I gave that, to this allergy&#39; (not clarified further) really she gave only 1 tablet a day.&#34; Reporter stated, &#34;On 20May2021, they did a blood test, they did urine test, they did a ECG, so the hospital did all and the doctor too, nothing new.&#34; The reporter had lab test result on chart, she stated they put on her chart but she also had the copy of the results. Okay, here they put the result is a line on the chart. Okay here they put like linear line lab test complete, she get all the line because here they didn&#39;t put results but screen for metabolic and kidney disorder they did, they did an &#39;urinary tract infection&#39; (not clarified) they have marked in the ECG. Okay you going to ask for specific (incomplete sentence).&#34; The patient had no other illness but reporter need to know what Gardasil and Covid 19 vaccine have in common because the symptoms were very similar. Nausea that does not go away. She asked if it is the preservative or what ingredients. Never had a reaction to any other vaccine. She just wanted to call the Medical Department if she should have the vaccine on Saturday or not.

This case pertains to patient 3 of 3. A 15-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, Lot Number: ER8727; Expiry Date: 31Jul2021), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration on 17Jun2021 (at the age of 15-year-old) as a single for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTEC COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date as a single for COVID-19 immunisation and had no reaction. On 17Jun2021, after 15 minutes of observation, the patient had a severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness and stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. On an unspecified date, the patient also had nausea and vomiting. The patient pulse ox (documented as provided by caller) went down to 83%, she had severe headache, nausea, vomiting and she was unconscious. When she was unconscious was when her pulse ox was 83% and she stopped breathing intermittently for 10 to 12 seconds at a time. Then she started breathing again but was not responsive after she received the epinephrine then her pulse ox steadily rose again but was not responsive. She was like this until EMS took her away. The reporter stated that the most severe case was for this particular patient. She had already been vaccinated and had already gone through the 15 minute observation. All these kids came in a bus together, but this patient was sitting in the vehicle after the observation when the guardian brought her back to the nurses saying that she was complaining of a severe headache and at that point she had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness. The nurses reported that it appeared that she stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83%. At that time they administered epi (epinephrine) and called EMS. Her pulse ox and her breathing improved after the administration of epi, however she remained unresponsive when she was on the way to the hospital with EMS. The patient was taken to the hospital and she did improve. This was the 2nd dose, she had the 1st dose and did not have a reaction to it. The seriousness of the events severe headache, difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as medically significant. The reporter stated that it was very serious. This patient reaction was a little more intense than just an anxiety induced reaction. She says with a pulse ox of 83% if they had not intervened then this would of been life threatening. It is medically significant but if they had not intervened then it would have been life threatening especially when you&#39;re talking about gurgling and a pulse ox of 83%. The reporter tends to think that with that severe of a reaction, with the pulse ox that low and her being unresponsive, she believes that this was probably a true adverse event. Outcome of the events was reported as unknown.  The reported causality for the events severe headache, had difficulty breathing and lost consciousness, stopped breathing several times for multiple seconds and they described her to be gurgling when her pulse ox went down to 83% was reported as related.  Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on known drug safety profile, there is reasonable possibility of causal association between the events respiratory arrest, loss of consciousness, dyspnea and headache and the suspect drug.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Client received dose 1 of the COVID19 Pfizer vaccine (Lot# EW0187 Exp 08/31/21) at 13:32 from RN1.  RN1 reported that within 5 seconds of receiving the vaccine, the client reported she felt dizzy and experienced a syncopal episode for 2-3 seconds.  As the syncopal episode was occurring, ancillary staff, requested RN2 radio for a Lead Nurse &amp; EMT.  At 13:34 Lead RN arrived at station 6, radioed for an EMT, and observed client sitting up in the vaccination chair being held by her mother and RN1.  Lead RN noted client?s head was down with her eyes open, exhibiting pallor and was diaphoretic.  Lead RN asked client her name and how she was feeling.  Client did not respond.  Co-Lead RN entered the room at 13:35. RN1, Lead RN, Co-Lead RN, and client?s mother guided client to the floor, laid her in a supine position, lifting her legs and feet on a chair.  Co-Lead RN removed client?s mask, continued to ask client her name.  Within 2-3 seconds of repositioning client, she became responsive and alert &amp; oriented to person, place, time, and event.  Client also immediately stated, ?I?m fine.?  EMT1, EMT2, and EMT3 came to the station at 13:36 with a zero-gravity chair.  The EMTs assisted client into the zero-gravity chair.  Client?s mother stated client has no underlying health conditions, no allergies, and that birth control is the only medication the client takes.  The client confirmed this by nodding her head in agreeance.  EMT2 gave client a bottle of water and the client immediately started drinking the water.  Lead RN asked client if she had eaten or drank anything today.  Client?s mother stated she did not realize her daughter had not eaten or drank anything prior to coming to get vaccinated.  Client stated she was given a granola bar downstairs at check-in and ate it before receiving the vaccine.  At 13:45 EMT1 took vitals.  Both EMT1 &amp; EMT2 were unable to obtain client?s blood pressure (HR:61, O2Sat:  97%).  Lead RN asked client and her mother what the client?s normal blood pressure is.  Client and her mother did not know, and client?s mother indicated that the client is an athlete in good shape.  At 13:48, EMT3 took client?s blood pressure, which was 100/60.  Client?s mother stated client was anxious about being vaccinated and has fainted when anxious in the past, but the last time was around 5 years ago.  Client stated she was feeling better and no longer feeling dizzy.  Client stated she just ?feels hot.?  Lead RN brought client an ice pack to put behind her neck and damp paper towels to wipe her face with.  At 13:59 EMT3 took client?s vitals (BP:  118/70, HR: 65, O2Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color was returning to her face and client was less diaphoretic.  Client finished her bottled water and was given another by EMT2, which she started drinking.  Lead RN asked client if she felt she could stand up.  Client stood up and stated she was ?feeling fine.?  At 14:05 all 3 EMTs escorted client and her mother to the observation room where she was monitored for an additional 30 minutes.  At 14:30 Lead RN went to the observation room where EMT1was taking client?s vitals (BP:  110/70, HR: 60, SPO2 Sat 98%).  Lead RN observed that client?s color had fully returned, and client was no longer diaphoretic.  Client stated she ?felt fine? and was hungry.  Client?s mother stated she would take client to get something to eat and EMT2 gave client an additional snack that client took with her when she left.  Client and her mother left at 14:30. Client was walking with a steady gait when she exited the building.

I came to assist and saw the patient looked pale and disoriented. We had her sit down and then lie on the ground with her feet elevated. 911 was called. The patient began to recover and said she didn&#39;t remember the past few minutes. EMS arrived and took her blood pressure which was 110/80. Eventually the patient felt well enough to sit up and eat some chicken and drink cold water.

A 15-years-old female patient (not pregnant) received bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 2 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 20Jun2021 12:00 at age of 15 years old (Batch/Lot Number: EW0196) as Dose 2, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. Administered is Pharmacy or Drug Store. Medical history included asthma and no known allergies. Historical vaccine included bnt162b2 (BNT162B2), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 30May2021 11:00 at age of 15 years old (Batch/Lot Number: EW0196) as Dose 1, SINGLE for covid-19 immunisation. After her 1st covid shot on 30May2021 and then had her period on 02Jun2021. It was 4 days early and was the worse period she has experienced in 3 years. She was bleeding excessively and extreme cramps. It maybe a coincidence. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Concomitant medication(s) included paracetamol (TYLENOL) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; salbutamol (ALBUTEROL HFA) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported.  After her 2nd covid shot on 20Jun2021 around 12 noon. Around 8 pm she started screaming in pain, hunched over, feeling nauseous and dizzy. Patient had clinic visit, ended up taking to ER where they gave her morphine for pain. They started IV, did bloodwork, ultrasound and ct scan with contrast all on 20Jun2021. They said it was an ovarian cyst rupture. Patient was only 15 years old and has had her period for 3 years and has never experienced anything like what she has in the last month. She is due for her next period on 29Jun21 and pray it&#39;s not as bad as last month after the shot. They do believe in science, but also think should study menstrual cycles with this shot. They pray this was just a fluke, but patient has never experienced pain or severe periods like this until shot. Treatment received for all events. The outcome of events was not recovered.   Information on Lot/Batch number was available. Additional information has been requested

We moved the patient to the floor where she regained consciousness . The patient had further complaints of numbness in the arms, light- headedness  and was nauseated and vomited. 911 was called and responded,  and the patient said she was ok and did not want to go to hospital.
