                                                fainted; Nausea; lips white; Really pale; 12 year old daughter; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient&#39;s mother). A 12-years-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 14May2021 got it closer to 12:00 (Batch/Lot number was reported: First letter was R, W or B, followed by A6256) at the age of 12-years-old as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization.

No family medical history relevant to adverse event, reporter who was the patients mother, is a fainter, who fainted a lot when she saw blood. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. As they were driving away, her daughter started feeling really nauseous, then fainted, was super pale, lips were white and she was really pale. It all occurred at the same time all started 10 minutes after vaccine on 14May2021. Then the ambulance came. Her daughter looked really bad and it freaked reporter out. Her daughter sat for a little while and was feeling better now. Her daughter was no longer pale, it went away. They checked her and everything was normal. No Emergency Room and no Physician Office visit required. Ambulance was called, they checked her and she was fine. Told her to keep any eye on her at home.

                                                It was within 5 minutes, she started having hives that went down her arm and spread to other arm, face, trunk, legs, stomach. I went and got a nurse and she called a pediatric team - three nurses and one doctor - they took her vitals and gave her some Benadryl - 30 ML (children&#39;s). They had her sit and drink a bottle of water. We watched to see if the swelling and the hives would shrink and go away. It was probably about 20 minutes later where they went away, but she developed a headache and she was nauseated. We administered Benadryl (gave her regular 25 mg tablet every 6 hours)  for the next 24 hors in the dosage times. She was nauseated the first day and she had headache for two days. The hives went away by the time she went to bed the evening of the vaccine.

Patient&#39;s pulse was faint, but became palpable once patient started talking again. Patient was breathing spontaneously. Patient reports last meal at 10am (7-8 hours prior vaccine administration), and anxiety to needles. Mother reports that patient faints with vaccine administration. Patient was taken to a cot to lay for 15 minutes and instructed to slowly drink sips of water in case of vomiting. Patient&#39;s symptoms resolved 15 minutes after laying supine.

The arm that got the injection was also really hot.  I had the patient lay down, and gave her an ice pack for her neck/arm.  After a few minutes patient said that she felt better.  I had her lay down for about 5 minutes.  She then sat up and said she was much better.  Wasn&#39;t dizzy or nauseous anymore.  Arm felt better too.  I had the patient sit and wait in total 30 minutes.  Mom wanted to leave sooner but I asked if she wait so that we could make sure she was ok.  THey waited 30minutes and left .  patient was fine.

                                                She was taking  Claritin for the few days before this event. She normally takes it every fall and every spring. She had seasonal allergy symptoms on the days leading up to this event- she had sore throat, runny nose, a little headache and congestion and developed a cough; on the day of this symptoms she spiked a low grade fever - 100.5. I did a rapid test for COVID at home which was negative for her. Sudden onset: A bunch of knives poking her on the inside of her stomach - pokey from hips to ribs.  She started to double over and bend over. Within 10 minutes, she couldn&#39;t stand up. She was telling me that something was really wrong. This isn&#39;t her character so I knew it was very wrong. I took her to ER. I was still concerned about appendicitis or COVID. This episode lasted for 90 minutes and then it came and went for the rest of the night and then after that - she had runny nose and congestion (normal allergies after that). She was better before they gave her the medication but it didn&#39;t seem like she really needed them. She was improving before she got either of the medications: Zofran; Levsin. They gave her a dosage of each there and  sent home with a prescription but we never had them filled as she was feeling better. - As it started to improve - it ( being the pokey pain) it was located closer to her ribs and breastbone.

That day she had headache, sore arm with earache and joint pain. Those symptoms continued for several days with some loose stools which lasted for two to three days with abdominal pain which persisted for a little over two weeks. We visited the doctor because of ear and throat pain and nausea. All tests were negative, but the symptoms improved slowly but they are totally resolved right now.

                                                did well acted right, felt right up until 5 AM this morning (6/4/21), she woke up throwing up over and over again, she couldn?t keep even a dissolvable Zofran down.  &gt; I immediately contacted her Hematologist and he told me to take her to the E.R.   &gt;  blood disorder, ?Hereditary Spherocytosis? came to life, flared up.  &gt;got extremely sick, where she could not walk or stand by 8:00 am this morning, when we arrived at the E.R. she had to be placed in a wheelchair because she was so weak.  &gt; Fluids, Pain medicine, Motrin, and nausea medication were given, plus rotating cool rags on her head to get her body temperature down.  &gt;  CBC, was off the charts, she has developed Anemia and was diagnosed this morning. &gt;  blood pressure dropped to 91/42.  &gt; I spoke with two hematologist on top of speaking with the 2 E.R. Doctors.  &gt;reached over 110%  immunity if not more.  &gt; Both Hematologist I spoke with plus the E.R. doctors determined she was at 100% immunity with just the first dose. &gt; Due to her reaction her Oncologist/Hematologist are communicating with other hematologist in the U.S.  about a reaction of a ?12 year old pediatric patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis?, further research will begin according to the Director of Onoccologist/Hematologist in the next few weeks to help other pediatric patients with Heriditary Spherocytosis in the U.S., the main point of this research is determining that one dose of Covid vaccine reaches 100% immunity vs 2 doses which would be equivalent to ?2 doses plus 2 booster shots of Covid vaccine? to someone with hereditary spherocytosis.  &gt;  &gt; After 8 hours of going through this, she was able to walk and stand. She was back to her old self.  &gt; If you can please reach out to CDC and let them know about a 12 year olds patient with Hereditary Spherocytosis  reaction to second dose of Phizer Vaccine.

                                                Patient received her 1st dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine around 11:20am, and started feeling bad within about 5-7 minutes of administration.  Her grandmother came to the counter to alert me that she wasn&#39;t feeling well, patient was lightheaded and just &#34;felt bad&#34;.  She did say she was nauseous, but was very agitated and had trouble verbalizing what was wrong.  She was very hot and clammy, her mother reported that she looked very pale.  I went to get a cuff to take her blood pressure, but by the time I got it on her arm, she was slumping significantly in the chair, so we decided to move her back to the clinic room to lay her down and elevate her feet.  Her mother and I each took an arm to move her.  I thought she may have briefly lost consciousness, her legs were not holding any of her weight, but her head was down, so I couldn&#39;t tell if she was alert.  We moved her a few more feet into the room and her mother moved to set her down in a chair, she was talking and alert.  At this time, her bladder evacuated and she vomited, her mom moved her the rest of the way to the chair. I immediately went back to the room with them and dialed 911 at 11:34am.  She was more alert at this time, did not report any difficulty breathing or any swelling or itching of the mouth or throat.  She was very anxious/agitated, but she did say that she felt a little better after vomiting.   EMS arrived at 11:52, I believe she vomited again before they got here, she did take a few sips of water.  EMS left at 12:06pm, the patient and her mother left at 12:07, she was walking on her own, with support from mom.

                                                Patient received her first dose of the Covid vaccine without a problem. She was reading a magazine in a chair while waiting for me (her mother) to have the second dose in the same room. About 5 to 10 minutes has passed since patient had received her injection. I looked over at patient, her eyes had rolled back and she had slumped in her chair. I ran over to her - her face was very red and she did not appear to be breathing. Her eyes were open but were not focused. I sat her up as straight as I could while the technician who administered the vaccine ran for the pharmacist. This took a few minutes. By the time the pharmacist arrived patient was gaining consciousness but began throwing up (although mainly dry retching). Her face had gone pale. The pharmacist was very helpful - she gave patient some Coke to drink and took her blood pressure, which was low. After 30 minutes of observation we were allowed to leave. The event was very frightening. Patient was very pale for the rest of the day. She had a severe pain in her left arm (and leg) which gradually improved over the next three days. We are very worried about her taking the second dose of the vaccine.

                                                Pt received vaccine (1st dose, Pfizer lot #EW0185) at 9:42 am and was seated in observation area. Patient raised hand and told observation/charge nurse her stomach hurt and she wanted to use the restroom. When asked to describe pain, pt stated she felt a little nauseous. The pt also stated she felt sick before getting the vaccine. The nurse accompanied to the patient to the restroom, and pt used the toilet. When pt came out of the stall, the nurse asked if she was feeling better. Pt stated her stomach still hurt, and she wanted to go to the school nurse&#39;s office. Charge nurse escorted pt to school nurse&#39;s office. The nurse stated &#34;oh, we know her,&#34; and told charge nurse pt had frequent abd pain. Charge nurse left pt in care of school nurse and returned to vaxxing area. Nurse who administered vax to pt stated to charge nurse that the pt told her her stomach was hurting when she asked if she was well, and that it was an &#34;ongoing thing,&#34; and she was getting an ultrasound for it Friday. Pt had no fever and no other complaints, but stated she was &#34;only getting the vaccine because my grandmother wants me to.&#34; One-half hour later, school nurse came to auditorium asking if charge nurse could speak to pt&#39;s GM. Per school nurse, pt&#39;s GM had picked pt up from school d/t stomach complaint and now was on the phone with a question about vax SEs. Charge nurse spoke with GM on the phone. Per GM, pt had vomited x 1 and her ears were &#34;very red.&#34; GM stated pt had recent issues w/ vomiting, but was concerned that pt&#39;s ears were red. GM denied any itching, rash, SOB, voice changes, dizziness, redness or weals anywhere else, or other symptoms of concern. Advised GM to give pt benadryl following dosing instructions on bottle, give her small sips of water and bland food as tolerated, and monitor pt at home. If pt&#39;s condition worsened, GM should take pt to UC/ED immediately for assessment. GM agreed w/ plan of care.  At 2:30 pm, the school health director emailed the school site coordinator and told her the &#34;student had an adverse reaction after today?s vaccination. She is currently in the emergency room and the docs believe it is definitely an allergic reaction to the vaccine. ....She did speak with your NP who was on-site this morning after she was dismissed to home, and advised to take Benadryl. Symptoms worsened and she went to ER where she received 2 doses of epi.&#34; Charge nurse reached out to school health director for information on where pt was treated to call for a report of symptoms prompting the epi intervention, but had not received a reply at the time of this report.

No further complaints of chest pain, but continues to be achy 1 week post vaccine especially in her knees.

Went to the Doctor and she said it looked like an allergic rash. She told us that based on my daughter&#39;s genetics and her asthma -  (I (her mother) had an anaphylaxis with my second Moderna shot  - my entire body was giant hives.)- That he did not recommend her to have the 2nd shot. My daughter still has some of the rash - a little on her left cheek, stomach and back still. The itching is gone. She did take Benadryl for it.

I took her to Urgent care because she was having chest pain, nausea and headaches. She also had 99.2F of fever but no congestion or cough.  At the ER an EKG was done and it was a bit off, lab work was also performed, x-ray of the chest was also done and they gave her an Albuterol treatment. She was given IV fluids and steroids and a CT scan of the chest was also performed. After 9 hours, she was discharged home and could not find anything wrong. On 05-25-2021 I took her to her pediatrician who pushed on her chest and it hurt her when he did this, her pain level was between 5 and 8 out of 10 on VAS scale. EKG&#39;s were performed as well as lab work, x-ray of the chest at the pediatrician office. Her daughter also said her chest hurt her to exhale and inhale.  The pediatrician said that her rib cage and breast bone where inflamed upon pressing on her daughter&#39;s chest and that she has s costochondritis.

                                                Patient fainted in the bathroom around 2:00am.  When we heard the thump, we ran to her and my husband picked her up.    She wasn&#39;t talking much, she started gagging and fainted again and her body started convulsing.  We believe she was having a seizure.  Patient has never had a seizure, her fever was high.  It only lasted probably 20-30 seconds.  When she stopped, she was able to walk with assistance back to her room.  We quickly gave her some medicine to bring down her fever.  Wet wash cloth and a fan on her.  I failed to take her temperature.  I was too concerned at what was going on.

                                                She woke me up in early morning - and she felt feverish and she had a headache. I gave her Tylenol and she went back to sleep. When she woke up around 08:00 a.m. she felt like she had the flu - terrible headache, chills, 100 degree fever, body aches and nauseous and really restless. By the morning, her left arm at injection site was also sore. We gave Ibuprofen at 10 am to help with aches and pain. About 20 min later, she threw up a lot. I called the doctor and talked to nurse. Told me to wait four hours before giving pain meds again. We gave her Pedialyte. at 02:00 pm, I gave her a dose of Tylenol and in within 30 seconds after giving it to her she threw up again, a lot. I called the doctor again. Nurse said to give her more Tylenol when she was able to feel better. She took a bath and drank some Pedialyte and that helped rehydrate her and then we gave her Tylenols when she was feeling up to it. On Sunday, when she woke up, she had swollen and painful lymph nodes on armpit on her left side and those are still persisting - not as swollen but painful a bit. She was tired still on  Sunday but feeling a lot better. Tiredness, sore arm and pain in lymph nodes under her left arm were what persisted on Sunday. She still has pain under her left arm with swollen lymph nodes but did go back to school today.

She went back to bed but then woke up and at 06:00 am threw up again. She said she hadn&#39;t been able to poop for 2-3 days. Docusate for constipation on Friday and she went twice but she told me yesterday that she hasn&#39;t gone again since that time. Has not received more than the one dosage of the Docusate. Dr. gave her sublingual med for throwing up but we haven&#39;t filled it as her nausea is gone. She says her stomach doesn&#39;t hurt and she doesn&#39;t feel nauseous - she just hasn&#39;t been able to have a BM again.

After about 5 minutes of sitting in the chair for her 15 minute observation, her mom said she felt nauseous and like she was going to pass out.  She was laid her back in the chair.  The patient&#39;s mother went to get orange juice.   She was pale and her eyes were rolling back in her head.  She did pass out for a few seconds, and I checked the patient&#39;s pulse and blood pressure.  BP 139/58, pulse 53.  By that point she was coming back around.  After she sat for several minutes and had orange juice and water, she was feeling much better.

                                                Patient while sitting in the post-vaccination are, fainted in her chair. Upon my immediate arrival, I tapped the patient and she was coming to consciousness. Patient upon awakening, felt nauseous and wanted to vomit, but barely did. I gave the patient water and sports drink and the patient was regaining normalcy. Both the patient and her guardian reported that she did not eat or drink anything prior to coming to the vaccine appointment and that she was very nervous and worried prior. Patient denied history of fainting. I recommended to have the patient sit for at least another 15-20 minutes, but the parent stated his daughter was fine and decided to leave.

She was offered water and hard candy while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. She took a small amount of each, but declined anything else from the store. She seemed to be in significant distress and had difficulty moving to the immunization room where she would be out of view from others in the store. Parmedics arrived and checked her vitals and said those looked ok, so they didn&#39;t seem concerned. Patient still seemed very unsteady when leaving, but did say that her vision had improved. Patients were advised to keep a very close eye on her.

She was sitting up in a chair during this time, with her mom holding her up.  She came to, the about 20 seconds later, she passed out again for another 10 seconds.  She came to, and was given some water to drink, but 20 seconds after that she threw up the water.  I took her blood pressure, and it was 60/40, with a pulse of 60.  She was very pale.  After resting in the chair and taking deep breaths, her color returned and she felt much better.  she also said her vision wasn&#39;t blurry anymore.  Ten minutes later, she left with her mom, feeling ok.  She was very anxious about getting the shot, and told me she had passed out in the pass after giving blood.

We sit down, she is not feeling better and within 3 minutes or so she said she felt? dizzy and feel like I?m going to throw up.? She then starts nodding off and on, not able to keep her eyes open. I waved over for help and by the time volunteers got to her she went limo and passes out. She was taken by wheelchair to medic room and they had her lay down. She came alert and said ?everything went black? and had no memory/recollection or awareness of where she was and how she got to the medic room. We gave her water and I asked for crackers and she felt better and was able to leave around 115pm.  In addition, we saw a teenage male pass out prior to my daughter and was also taken by wheelchair. I spoke with a RN as I was leaving and was told multiple teens had had the same initial reaction today.  She had no reactions or side effects with her first dose.

                                                She got her vaccine, she was sitting in the chair and 4-5 minutes after the shot she started telling her grandfather that she felt nauseated.  She then started feeling dizzy and looked like she was going to pass out and he caught her and he laid on her on the floor on a pillow.   There was a off-duty paramedic to assist her and they suggested to call 9-1-1 and they showed up 5-6 minutes later.  She was then taken to Hospital.  They ran a lot of laboratory tests, urinalysis and everything was negative.   Her white blood cell count was high and her URC&#39;s and UBC&#39;s were high.  Her albumin was also high.   She was then released from the ER and was told to FU with PCP within 2 days.  She is still having the symptoms of headache, sore throat, and achy bones, the typical flu-like side effects.   She is taking Tylenol for the symptoms, as well as cough drops for her throat.

After she came to we helped her to a chair and sat her down, advised her to put her head between her knees, and got her some water that she requested.  After a few minutes she appeared rather pale and went to ask her if she was ok and she asked for a trash can because she felt like she was going to be sick.  We gave her a garbage bag and she did get sick in the garbage bag.  We kept an eye on her for another 15-20 minutes and she stated that she felt better and that she thought she was ok to leave.   We offered her help to her car but she denied it saying she would be ok with she walked slowly.  Her father was with her the entire time.  While talking with them the father did state that she had incidents like that in the past where she stood up too fast and got light headed and passed out.

                                                First symptom was dizziness and nausea. Then, immediately began sweating profusely . Then began seeing spots that distorted her vision. Immediate pain in the ears, which felt as is the ears were very swollen and inflamed. It was difficult to talk because talking caused pain in the ears. Severe headache. Obviously her anxiety level escalated.   We immediately found wet paper towels to place on her forehead and back of the neck to cool her. I found a hair tie and tied her hair up off her neck to keep her as cool as possible. She was sweating so much she soaked her t-shirt and was pouring sweat down her face, neck and body. We also moved patient from the chair, and placed her on the floor of the pharmacy, leaning against the wall with her legs stretched out.  As a type 1 diabetic, the obvious concern was blood sugar during this reaction. Patient wears an insulin pump and Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. I was able to read her blood sugar levels during all the reaction time. Her blood sugar level spiked up. It then began to drop after a few minutes. I had an apple juice, and gave her the 15 carb apple juice.

                                                Received her first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine on Sunday May 16,2021 at around 2:50 pm. At around 7:20 pm on May 16,2021 she stood up to walk to the bathroom. She began feeling nauseous when she stood up. While she was washing her hands, after going to the bathroom, she began to have difficulty with her vision. She describes white and blue dots obstructing her vision in both eyes. She also began to experience loud tinnitus. She described hearing multiple frequencies.  The problem with her vision and the tinnitus continued as she walked through our house to a couch where she laid down. The vision problem and tinnitus continued while she laid on the couch. Her breathing was rapid but she thinks this may have been due to the stress caused by her other symptoms. This episode lasted for several minutes and then the vision problem resolved. The tinnitus continued for several minutes after the vision problem resolved. The intensity of the tinnitus slowly decreased until it finally stopped. The following evening, she experienced tinnitus for a few minutes but it was less intense than it was the previous evening. She very rarely has experienced tinnitus in the past. She has very infrequently experienced brief episodes of orthostatic hypotension when she was dehydrated. When this event occurred, she felt like she was well hydrated. This event lasted much longer and she has never experienced this problem with her vision in the past.

I don?t believe she hit her head we didn?t see a lump. She came too right away and got nauseated and light-headed again sitting up so we took her to lay down on the stretcher. She was doing ok but laying down when I left.   The nurse that administered the immunization wrote: She got vaccinated, tolerated it well. Told her sister she barely felt it and expressed relief. Sat for a minute while in handed her mom paperwork ( vaccination card). Then got up, stood with mom and brother. Was standing one minute and went down without warning, standing next to brother and mom. I had just finished vaccinating the sister, I was putting a bandaid on her when it happened so couldn&#39;t have been more than a couple of minutes.   Dr.  observed this patient after they passed out at the vaccination clinic and subsequently released her home with the family.

After about 5 minutes she was feeling better and we moved her into the immunization room to wait for EMS. EMS came and evaluated her and determined she was ok to go home

She was nauseous, unable to sit and even stand. She was getting rainbow circles in her vision. Rushed her to emergency to UCSF, drs ran various  blood tests and brain MRI but everything was normal. It was also found that Bipasha had high BP 149/61. The drs could not make out what happened and they discharged her later on after giving some IV fluids and some pain medicine.  On 5/31 and 6/1, at home, patient was seemingly okay.  On 6/2, Wednesday, patient developed headache again, same symptoms like on 5/30. We rushed her to Urgent care in Fremont and saw her pediatrician dr and a pediatric neurologist. Her BP was high then also 144/87. No cause could be found why. The pediatric neurologist was suggesting it is possible that some Inflammation could be causing the blood fluctuations. Orthostatic testing resulted in major fluctuations of BP.  Both neurologist and neurosurgeon have ruled out hydrocephalus. They are saying heart inflammation could be a cause.

Once the patient regained consciousness, the patient was nauseated and vomited.  Minutes later she had another seizure but immediately came out of it.  We asked the patient if this happen to her during the first dose and she said it did not.  The patient does not have a history of epilepsy.  The patient&#39;s mother did say she had the exact same reaction when she had braces put on.  The patient sat in the waiting room for 30 minutes while drinking water.  Before the patient left, we had check up on her and she said she felt completely fine.  I (the pharmacist) called the mother a couple of hours later to check up on the patient.  The mother said she felt fine as if nothing ever happened.  I did recommend to her that her daughter  gets checked up at urgent care today just to be on the safe side.  The mother said she has an appointment with her primary care next week.

                                                She got the second shot of COVID-19 shot around 3 PM on 6/3. She had a sore arm, lower fever, and headache on the second day (6/4), which was expected. On 6/5, she complained about chest congestion in the morning. She described that it felt like running after a mile. I asked her to drink more water and get some rest. The discomfort didn&#39;t get away, so I consulted her pediatrician over the phone. Her pulse and blood pressure were normal (86/103/75). She didn&#39;t feel short of breath. And her finger oximeter result was 99.  In the afternoon, she described the discomfort as after some strenuous exercise and kept putting her hand over her heart. She felt tired and didn&#39;t have a good appetite for lunch or dinner, and only ate half meals. After dinner, around 9:30, she throws up and felt a little better.  Then she took a capsule of Motrin liquid gel of 200 mg ibuprofen and went to bed. She slept well and felt OK this morning.
