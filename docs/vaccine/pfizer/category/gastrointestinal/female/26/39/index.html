                                                Within seconds increased heart rate shortness of breath light headedness and dizziness but thought it could have been anxiety. Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

Then came the shortness of breath and the feeling of pins and needles which also brought itching and some minor hives with it. The dizziness, nausea, and feeling of fainting went away after about 10 minutes and I had to go to the Emergency Department to take care of the shortness of breath and hive like reaction. I was given some medications and they diagnosed it as a moderate allergic reaction to the vaccine. I was completely fine with the first one.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

I did not improve when I woke up on 01/25.  The chills and myalgia worsened and were complicated by vomiting without blood.  I called off sick from work and took 3 Aleve tablets.  I went back to sleep with improvement in symptoms approximately 6 hours later, with only mild myalgias and a very sore L. arm.  Symptoms completely resolved by the morning of 01/26.

                                                Went to ED on 1/14/21. emailed caregiver for information. As far as what happened, I received my 2nd dose of Pfizer on Jan. 13th @ 05:15 at hospital and started feeling symptoms roughly six hours later, symptoms being nausea, chills, splitting headaches, muscle fatigue, feeling tired and joint pain. I had understood that these side effects were common and not to worry, however, the next day on Jan. 14th around 11:00am, I blacked out at home. Luckily, my partner had caught me before I feel to the ground, but he stated that my eyes had glazed over, my breathing was shallow, and I hardly had a pulse. He was getting ready to do chest compressions, but I had come out of whatever fog that had knocked me down and became responsive. Around 12:00 pm I had arrived at the ED where they had given me a bag on NS, Zofran for the nausea and Toradol for some inflammation management. I believe I discharged from the ED around 15:20.

                                                It started 5-6 hours after the shot with headache and dizziness . In the evening I had a fever of 37,6°C and because I was scared it will be higher I took pills for fever. On the second day I had muscular pain and my fingers were swollen in the morning. Also I had lower back pain, runny nose and I was nauseous . On the 3rd day I was feeling dizzy, nauseous, couldn&#39;t concentrate and an intense headache. Pills weren&#39;t helping at all

The patient reported that she received the first dose of the COVID vaccine on 28Jan and afterwards experienced, arm swelling, and tenderness that has last for 4 days. She also reported experiencing feeling faint, high blood pressure of 150/100 and some trouble breathing on an unspecified date and nausea. The patient further reported that she was calling because she got her first dose of Pfizer&#39;s vaccine and she was curious if this was normal and if she needs to go see her doctor and she wants to report the symptoms. After she got the injection she felt super faint and got really high blood pressure on an unspecified date. She was not sure if it was because she had anxiety, but she had trouble breathing on an unspecified date. She got nauseated afterwards. Her arm swelled up really big and the swelling has stayed there for four days. Her arm was still swollen on an unspecified date. She has allergies and has had anaphylactic reaction in the past. She was still nauseated and feels super tired. The patient asked how long do the symptoms last. The patient&#39;s weight was reported between 122 to 123 pounds. The patient clarified that the nausea started 15 minutes after she got the shot on 28Jan2021. The nausea has lasted through this. She got chills the next day (29Jan2021) after the shot. She has felt super fatigue. The swelling has gone down, but it was still swollen. It was still hurting. She has no idea if that was normal. She also felt dizzy and disoriented after getting the shot. She was not sure if it was because her blood pressure was so high. It was high for her because her blood pressure was normally low. She thinks her blood pressure 150/100 after she got the vaccine. The outcome of all the events was unknown.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

                                                The morning after getting the 2nd COVID-19 vaccination, I walked to work and started to feel more fatigued than usual within about 40 minutes after starting to walk from my apartment at 0600. I had a hard time staying awake, started to become flushed and feeling feverish at 0700 at work, and began to develop a headache and nausea around 0745. I went to sick call on my ship after realizing I couldn&#39;t power through the symptoms around 0800, and my Senior Chief  mentioned earlier in the report) sent me home with motrin, tylenol, and mucinex for any congestion that may come up. Today (14JAN21) I seem to be a little more active and have an easier time staying awake, the headache and nausea have dissipated completely. However, I am still feeling more fatigued than I have been lately, and I began to feel flushed and feverish again around the same time in the morning.

                                                When I went to get the shot, I had a  firm bump with what looked like a white head on my left arm from the first shot. When she injected the 2nd dose, the bump was painful and grew twice in size on my arm and started bleeding. The technician rubbed the area for a fews minutes and the swelling went down. The bump went down, but the whole day, I felt a little sick. At around 7pm, I felt feverish, with muscle aches and chills. My skin was sensitive to touch, I felt nauseous, and I could barely walk. The bottom of my left eyelid also became a little swollen. The symptoms resolved the next morning.

                                                First started off with a cold feeling around injection site. Around 11:30 at night I felt muscle aches in my calves. 30 minutes later my legs were having severe muscle aches and joint pain in my ankles. I was having cold chills and aches the whole night along with sweating. On 1/20/2021 (the next day) the muscle aches, chills, and joint pain continued through the whole day. I was nauseous at times and did not have an appetite. Around 5 o clock I felt some relief with my leg pain but it started again around 9 o clock. I continued switching Tylenol extra strength and ibuprofen. I went to bed on 1/20 at midnight with little leg pain but major neck and back aches. I did not have cold chills through the night or sweating. Today (1/21/2021) leg pain is near gone, but joint pain is still there in my left ankle and knee. My legs feel heavy and strange and is causing me to walk slowly because I feel like my legs are very fatigued and off balance. I have had neck and back aches all day. I have not had chills today

                                                within minutes after my shot, I started to have difficulty swallowing. i was monitored for 30 minutes at the vaccine site before being escorted to the medical observation area. While in the medical observation area I tried to take a sip of water but could not swallow it. At that moment I began having a tight feeling in my chest. I began to hyperventilate followed by difficulty breathing or talking. This was accompanied by feelings of impending doom, and uncontrollable trembling and inability to concentrate on what the medical observation area Doctor was saying. The time from the drink of water until I was able to breathe, speak, and concentrate normally was about 20 minutes. Tightness in my chest has improved but not fully recovered. General malaise and headache have developed.

                                                I woke up at 1:30am with nausea, chills, sweating, and  diarrea. I went to the bathroom and vomited, my vision started darkening. After some time sitting on the toilet I stood up to wash my hands and reach for a hair tie to put my hair up because I was sweating profusely. I felt my vision darkening again and fell to the ground. I never lost consciousness and laid on the ground for a few seconds. I felt my stomach begin to churn again so I got up and sat on the toilet and began having diarrhea again. I texted my sister to come upstairs and bring me a Tylenol and some peppermint oil for my stomach. I took 1000mg of Tylenol, rolled peppermint oil on my stomach and stayed sitting with a cold towel on my head. I was then able to stand up and go back to bed at around 3am (shortly after taking the Tylenol). The next morning I woke up at around 8:30am, still feeling fatigued and mild chills. The diarrea and nausea are gone.

This 27-year-old non-pregnant female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; lot number EL3247) intramuscularly in the left arm on 25Jan2021 (at the age of 27-years-old) at 09:00 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to vaccination the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Concomitant medication included escitalopram oxalate (LEXAPRO) from an unknown date for an unknown indication, dicyclomine from an unknown date for an unknown indication, doxycycline from an unknown date for an unknown indication, levothyroxine from an unknown date for an unknown indication, birth control from an unknown date for an unknown indication and women&#39;s multivitamins from an unknown date for an unknown indication. The patient had not received any other vaccine within 4 weeks prior to the vaccine. On 26Jan2021 at 08:00 the patient experienced intense upper stomach pains (difficult time bending over, etc.). Additionally, she experienced a difficult time breathing/shortness of breath. The patient reported the events resulted in an emergency room or urgent care visit. It was unknown if the patient received treatment for the events. The clinical outcomes of intense upper stomach pains (difficult time bending over, etc.) and a difficult time breathing/shortness of breath were recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination the patient had tested negative for COVID-19 on 26Jan2021 via nasal swab and polymerase chain reaction tests.

                                                My last period started Tuesday Feb 2nd and did not stop until 14 days later, more than double my usual menstrual cycle. It seemed pretty normal and painless, but then on 8th day I was surprised to find myself still bleeding . It was a darker color around then, but then became brighter and I noticed myself passing clots when I went to the restroom that were loose, but about the size of a quarter or half dollar. I did not bleed through any menstrual pads, but the return of bright red after it being a darker red that im used to at the end of a period had me concerned. I was in slight discomfort around my uterus/bowels and I couldn&#39;t tell if it&#39;s my body recovering from the vaccine, or something else.  I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine 2/11/21 (Pfizer) and stayed home from work as I had a fever/headache/chills (this was not unexpected to me, my coworkers had the same symptoms).  Family medical history: grandmother (dad&#39;s mom) in remission from stage 4 uterine cancer about 5 years ago. Mom had endometriosis at 45 and had a hysterectomy.

A week and a half before I took the second COVID vaccine, I had a TB test done. Exhaustion is still there and I still have nausea. Dizziness has been gone since second week of the 2nd dose of vaccine. Swelling on the injection site is gone. I had a doctor visit - Video visit with clinic and the dr recommended bedrest - February 11th or 12th - no meds given.  I&#39;m due Sept 26, 2021. This is my fourth pregnancy - I had my daughter who is eight years old; an abortion; had my son who is five and he was born pre-term due to lack of fluids in the stomach - 4 lbs 5 oz. and now this pregnancy.

This 27-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 10Mar2021 10:15 (Batch/Lot number was not reported, reported as &#34;one number on there is EN and then she does not know if it is a G or 6 and then 204&#34;) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization.

On 10Mar2021, patient had eye puffiness in her left eye. Patient asked if it is safe to take the second dose. Her eyelid got puffy which began 30 minutes after having the Pfizer COVID Vaccine and it is not ongoing but resolved completely after a few minutes. She did not require treatment for the eye puffiness and the puffiness was mostly on her upper eyelid of her left eye. Patient stated that she does not know in terms of causality if the Pfizer COVID vaccine is related to the reported events and was worried because a week after she got the vaccine, she had other symptoms and was not sure if they are connected with the vaccine. She also reported that she does not think the eye puffiness itself is that serious but it is medically significant and the other symptoms she had were chest pain, chest heaviness, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are not ongoing anymore and began around Friday, 19Mar2021 and resolved after a couple of hours of when they began. For the chest pain, chest heaviness and abdominal pain, she just took an antacid Prilosec for treatment. She thought about going to the emergency room but also thought she was having an anxiety attack and was close to having to go to the emergency room that night. She did get pretty anxious easily and that probably exacerbated it. AEs did not require a visit to emergency room or physician office.

                                                Mild headache about 6 hours after then by about 12 hours after dose had profound chills, body aches, severe nausea and temperature 99.8 F. I treated the nausea with Zofran with some improvement in nausea, but other symptoms continued. My max temperature (without antipyretic affecting) was 100.7 F with continued nausea, body aches, fatigue and headache until the 24 hour after vaccine time frame. After 24 hours, nausea had improved largely to just mild, mild headache continued and fatigue/body aches. Around 28 hours, temp was 100.2 F (outside of last antipyretic dose) with same symptoms. Now around 30 hours out with recent Motrin taken, my nausea is still mild, low appetite, improved body aches and less fatigue. I have not had any site reactions other than pain starting around 6 hours after injection.  Course to come yet unknown.

Called off work from my job as a flight nurse at midnight. Tried to sleep it off until about 0430 when the body aches became unbearable. Ate a few bites of yogurt and took 400mg of ibuprofen. No change in symptoms until 0530 when I took a hot shower which helped relieve some muscle pain. Took 400mg ibuprofen again at 1030 with a small snack with no change in pain or fevers. Took hot shower again which helped briefly. Nausea subsided around 1630, enough that I had a small meal of bland food and another 400mg of ibuprofen. By 1700 more tolerable myalgias and fever came down some. 2230 another 400mg dose of ibuprofen, fitful night of sleep waking again at 4am with shooting lower back pain and fever. Took another dose of 400mg ibuprofen and a hot shower. Woke up at 1000am sweaty with mild myalgias and low grade fever. Took another dose of ibuprofen 400mg, 30 minutes later profusely sweaty but afebrile. Fatigued all day and poor appetite until late evening. Woke up next day after better night of sleep at 0730. Mild fatigue and bad heartburn all day and night. Left arm still sore to touch. This morning (1/11) feeling mild heartburn but better.

This 28-year-old female nurse (patient) reported that she received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EL3246) at single dose at left deltoid for COVID-19 immunisation on 11Jan2021 at 4:30 pm. Relevant history included contraception. Family Medical History Relevant to AE(s) was none. Concomitant drug included ongoing ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel (NUVARING) for contraception for years. The patient experienced a headache, back ache, nausea and was almost passing out. She had the first dose of the vaccine on the 11Jan2021 at 4:30 PM and was in bed around 10:00 that night.  She woke up at 5:00 AM on 12Jan2021 and didn&#39;t feel great, her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine and she was nauseated at 5:30, which was not that horrible. She took some Tylenol. Then she got to work and around 9:00 she felt like she was going to get sick. She had horrendous nausea, chills, weakness, eye pain, headache/ head pain, and back pain. Her clothes hurt because the body aches were so bad. She felt like she was going to pass out, like a vasovagal. She went to urgent care because her manager didn&#39;t think it was side effect. She went and got swabbed (result unknown), whatever. She had a fever then. They told her it was a reaction to the vaccine. Her temperature was 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit when she went to Urgent care. She would say the fever started at 12:30PM on 12Jan2021. She did not know if fever would be ongoing because she was taking fever reducer and it was working. The events weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain were reported as serious since medically significant. The nausea was better around 2:00PM. The outcome of event nausea, Chills was and Weakness was resolved on 12Jan2021.  The outcome of events eye pain, head pain, and back pain was resolving. The outcome of event &#39;her arm was killing her more than a normal vaccine&#39; was recovering. The outcome of fever was unknown. History of all previous immunization with the Pfizer vaccine considered as suspect was none. Additional Vaccines Administered on Same Date of the Pfizer Suspect was none. Prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks) was none. AE(s) following prior vaccinations was none.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported events, weakness, eye pain, head pain, and back pain, and the administration the suspect vaccine, BNT162B2.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RA, IEC, as appropriate.

I suddenly became light headed and felt very abnormal. Broke out in hives on my neck and face . They took me to the ER department and by the time they wheeled me down the hall I was white , very disoriented. Couldn?t open my eyes and went from slurred speech to I couldn?t speak at all and couldn?t swallow. My throat and closed and I was having a anaphylactic reaction . They administered epi pen , pepcide and steroids. Since then I have been very weak , running a fever , tired , dizzy . Can hardly walk and I get out of breath from standing or walking .My muscles are very sore and have spams . Almost last night I went to the ER  due to theses symptoms lingering. I have been unable to work since the vaccine was administered to me .

All that night, I was hot and sweating and freezing cold. I had a lot of pain in my lower back and would have to position myself in fetal position. There was no position that felt comfortable.  24 hours after the shot, still fatigue, stayed in bed for most of the day. No appetite.  48 hours: limited appetite, I was hungry, but when eating just felt bloated and not interested. Would feel stomach aches if I attempted to eat more.  The monday following the vaccine, I had eaten lunch and noticed I had a burning feeling in a lower area of my throat. My stomach felt slightly upset.

                                                3-5 minutes after receiving the vaccine, I felt a sense of panic and a tingling on my lips, that then spread to my mouth, throat, and tongue. I asked the nurse if my lips were swollen, and she said no.  A few minutes later my heart rate increased and I felt really lightheaded. After 7-10 minutes I felt my tongue tingling and it had become swollen. I told the nurse that I think my tongue was swollen and she said it looked okay. I had a hard time talking because I wasn&#39;t used to be tongue being so large. The nurses stayed and talked to me for the rest of the 30 minute waiting period. I was able to talk and breath while making a conscious effort.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether the high heart rate and lightheadedness were associated with my condition, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. I kept checking my tongue to see how swollen it was.  After the 30 minutes, the nurses had me stand up to see if I could. Once I could, they said I was all set to go. They did not get an Epi-pen for the swollen tongue or give me instructions on how to treat it. They were insensitive and dismissive of my symptoms. they kept repeating &#34;I think your just nervous.&#34; Once I got home, I still had the swollen tongue and tingling, but was able to go up and down stairs and go about my day. It was a little difficult to swallow one of my pills when I got home, but I was able to. I checked my blood pressure around 4:30 p.m. and it was 121/84 and my pulse was 79 bpm sitting. I did not take anything to treat my swollen tongue. The swollen tongue and tingling feeling in my throat continued for another 2.5 hours, until 6:00 p.m. Once the swelling was down, my tongue felt like I burnt it on a hot beverage, almost a numb feeling. I also experienced more common side effects such as body aches, fatigue, and feeling feverish.   After this episode I had extremely high anxiety where it was difficult for me to sleep the following night. I called a 24/7 nurse line and she said to talk to my doctor. I had less than 4 hours sleep the night after I had my vaccine.  I called my doctor&#39;s office this morning and I spoke to a nurse who worked as a nurse on the COVID Vaccine hotline.  She relayed the message to the doctor who was covering for my doctor while she&#39;s on medical leave. I received a call around 9:30 a.m. saying that the doctor on leave recommend I should talk to my PCP but that she thought I had an allergic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and that I should not get the second dose. She said they were not sure how I would react with the second dose, and they&#39;re afraid that my allergic response might be more severe and life threatening.  I hope this report helps other people who experience these symptoms.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM.

The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

                                                Soreness at injection site began a few hours after administration. By the evening I began experiencing headache and an overall malaise feeling. This progressed into chills to the point of shivering and feeling feverish. Overnight I developed another headache and felt very mildly nauseous in addition to feeling fever/chills. Overnight I took 3 OTC Advil, was bundled up under multiple blankets, and got lots of rest. The next day I felt much better, only some fatigue.

                                                1/8/21 - 15 minutes after second dose of COVID19 vaccine I had flushing (warm rash like) all over my chest and neck that lasted for about an hour. No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

                                                During the first few hours following vaccination, I had soreness at the injection sight and a mild headache. About 10hours later, I started to experience more severe symptoms including a fever of 101-102deg, chills/cold sweats, a moderate headache, and body aches. This continued throughout the night and into the next day. In addition, I began to experience a burning sensation in my chest, similar to heart burn. I have consistently been taking Tylenol and recently took Tums to aide with the heartburn feeling.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea and decreased appetite. This persisted throughout the entire next day following vaccination. The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.  I then started working part-time for some weeks and am being introduced again now to my regular scheduled.

                                                I received my second dose of the vaccine at 03:00pm on 1/12/21. I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

                                                About 12 hours after the vaccine, I started having arm pain at the site and low back pain which is very unusual for me as well as a dull headache which is not uncommon for me. Around midnight I woke up with chills, and severe arthralgias in all joints down to the toes and fingers, and deep, boring pain in my long bones and neck. My skin and fingertips felt like they were burning. I was nauseated but didn?t vomit. I was up all night because I couldn?t find a position I wasn?t in pain in. Tmax 100.3 F. Took a gram of Tylenol with improvement of symptoms. Felt better in AM but when Tylenol wore off around 9 am, had another wave of the same pain all over. Tylenol improved. Felt almost completely normal by 4 pm with the exception of some lingering low back pain (central not muscular).

                                                Approximately 12/13 hours post-vaccine dose #2 I was woken from my sleep with severe body aches. Extremely uncomfortable, from neck to back to calves, without improvement with Tylenol or ibuprofen, causing me to be unable to sleep. Around hour 20 post-vaccine, I started to get chills. It wasn?t just feeling cold or shivering, it was full body convulsions that lasted approximately 15 minutes.  I became nauseas and dizzy after that for about an hour, unable to stand or walk anywhere. The severe body aches continued, with no improvement from Tylenol or ibuprofen or heating pad. Aches resolved around hour 30 post-vaccine and the only symptom left was pain at the injection site.

                                                Second dose of COVID vaccine (Pfzier/BioNTech) received Friday morning around 8:00, I left work about an hour early that day due to rising nausea, migraine and fatigue. By the time I got to my car in the parking garage I had thrown up and was so dizzy that I called my boyfriend to come pick me up. When I got home I immediately laid down to take a nap. 3 hours later I woke up very sore and achy and still had a migraine. I remained in bed and later that night I spiked a fever as high as 101.8 fahrenheit. I had severe chills and the aches were so bad that my bones hurt all over and it felt like someone was stabbing me with a metal broom handle. Pain spiked to 8 on the pain scale and with the length of time I had this pain, it was one of the worst experiences of my life. The dizziness and fatigue caused me to need help to get out of bed to use the restroom. I took ibuprofen frequently and Nyquil at night to help relieve the effects without it doing little more than taking the edge off. Saturday night was the same as Friday night with no relief of symptoms. Fever remained around 100.9. Sunday night it dropped to 99.8 with chills, dizziness and fatigue still remaining but aches slightly lessening. Monday night I was still dizzy and weak but not nearly as in much pain and fever had subsided. Tuesday I started to feel more normal by the end of the night, just easily out of breath and off and on again headache.

Two separate instances of this pain, one on 1/18/21 at 1600-1730, and one on 1/18/21 2230-0000.  The second instance the pain was so severe, lead to nausea and one episode of emesis. Initially trialed treatment with antacids but that did nothing to improve the pain. Evaluation by MD on 1/19 at 1300 diagnosed with pleuritic pain secondary to inflammation. No prior history of this, no cardiac history, and no history of GERD.  Other post vaccination symptoms included fever approx 10 hours following the vaccine, nausea, one episode of diarrhea, fatigue, body achs, dizziness, and chills, all of which resolved by 1/18 at 1100am.

                                                About an hour after receiving the vaccine I began to feel a little dizzy, tired, and started to develop a headache.  By the next day my headache became overwhelming and the the dizziness became so pronounced that I could not stand for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I a had an intolerable headache on the entire bottom of my head that made my neck start to hurt.   I felt nausea that did not improve until four days later. My joints were hurting sharply  two days after the immunization and lasted two days.    Most of my symptoms improved on the 13th of January, but were still lingering.  About 5 days after the shot my symptoms resolved completely.

I then was speaking with management and felt faint and short of breath, continued to be tingly.  Last night 1/19/21 I had a moment of not feeling well and my heart rate went from 60s to 120s with shortness of breath and nausea qnd tingling. This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

                                                I woke up the morning after the vaccine and felt very nauseous with occasional lightheadedness. I was also extremely fatigued and found it difficult to get out of bed or off of the couch. I had a severe headache that lasted the majority of the day. Thursday&#39;s are typically my day off therefore I did not have to call out of work sick, however I most likely would have if I had been scheduled that day.

A 29-year-old female patient recived the second dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot no: EK4176) via an unspecified route of administration on 12Jan2021 at 08:45 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. The patient had no known allergies.  Concomitant medication included colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL], manufacturer unknown), vitamin B12 (manufacturer unknown), vitamin c  (manufacturer unknown), melatonin (manufacturer unknown), biotin (manufacturer unknown) and elderberry [sambucus nigra] (manufacturer unknown). The patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, lot no: EJ1685) on 22Dec2020 at 9:00 PM on the left arm. The patient did not receive other vaccines in four weeks. The patient reported that after her second dose, she began experiencing severe side effects around 5:00 pm the same day (about 7 hours after the dose was administered). These side effects were fever, chills, severe headache, severe muscle and joint pain, chest tightness, and mild nausea. She also added a difficult symptom to describe, but her lungs felt inflamed, making it difficult to take deep breaths. These symptoms lasted for 36 hours unabated, and she was unable to sleep, go to work, eat, or go about daily activities during this time.

                                                After the vaccine was administered, 5-10 minutes later I began to feel a rapid heart rate. One of the nurses came to check on me, I described to her my symptoms, and she let me know if they get worse to inform her. In the next 5 minutes, my head began to hurt, as well as, some chest pain. She checked on me again, and said to let her know if things got worse. Within the next 5-10 minutes after, I had difficulty swallowing and speaking. I raised my hand, and the nurse came over, then proceeded to get help. They then took my blood pressure and heart rate. My blood pressure was 185/103 and I believe my pulse was 156 bpm. I was still having a hard time swallowing and speaking. They proceeded to get an epi pen and the doctor on site, as well as suggested to send me over the ER/ call 911. The doctor checked my lungs, and they noticed my blood pressure and heart rate was not decreasing to a normal level. I was then put in a wheel chair and transferred to the ER. At the ER, my blood pressure and heart rate was still elevated, as well as difficulty swallowing. The doctor ordered Benadryl via IV, steroids, and the epi pen. After having a reaction to the Benadryl, the epi pen was put on hold. After about 15 minutes, I began to feel better. I was put on IV fluids and observation. I was able to leave the ER around 12 pm 2/05/21. At this time,  7:22 pm, I am feeling better with mild muscle aches, and fatigue.

                                                minutes after administration, patient reports head feeling strange, so I asked her to remain seated so I can observe her prior to getting up to the observation room. Then she reports feeling nauseous and weak. I asked her what medical conditions she has and she told me she is diabetic and has kidney disease. I asked if she ate breakfast, she said she did not, only had something small before heading out in the morning. I gave her am ice pack to place on the back of her neck which helped relieve her symptoms of head feeling strange and the nausea. Once nurse arrived, we checked her pulse and blood pressure, at this time it was around 11:45 am and her pulse was low at 64 and blood pressure at 94/60, which patient states is her baseline normal blood pressure. We opened the windows so she could get some fresh air since the room was very hot and shortly after we took her pulse and blood pressure she seemed to be feeling better. By 11:50 am the ambulance arrived and paramedics asked if she would like to be taken to the hospital to get checked, she said even though she is feeling a lot better, she would prefer to go just in case.

                                                Approximately thirteen hours after I received my second dose of the vaccine I started having cramping in my abdomen.  The cramping got increasingly worse and I started to get really bad chills.  The cramping feeling turned into a stabbing pain and reached a threshold that I could no longer stand so my husband had to drive me to the ER.  I have never been in so much pain.  Once it the ER I received medicine for the pain and a CT scan that revealed that I had appendicitis and needed to have it removed with an appendectomy.

On day 8, I had vomiting and multiple episodes of diarrhea. I saw the doctor on day 9 but there was so much all-over abdominal pain, it was difficult to decipher the cause. A ct scan was ordered but needed authed by the insurance. On day 10 of symptoms with no reflief, I went to the ER. After a ct scan, it was determined that appendicitis was present for probably 10 days which lead to a perforated appendix with abscess and inflammation around the appendix. While admitted to the hospital for 3 days, I was treated with IV antibiotics but the appendix could not be removed due to so much inflammation and abscess. I have a follow up in a few weeks to remove the appendix once another ct scan determines the area is cleared up.

                                                About 12 hours of receiving my second dose I started to get really bad chills. Nothing could keep me warm and I had a fever of 102.  I had muscle aches  as if I just went through a rigorous workout. I had zero appetite but I?m not sure if that was due to side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. When I did finally eat something that evening I could barely taste it, I ate it but my taste buds were faintly picking up the flavors. Again I don?t know if it was because of the side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. The following day, Saturday 01/09/21 I only had chills which would come and go. I did not have fever and my appetite was back. Now today, 01/10/21 I feel my usual self.

                                                I developed mild injection site pain about 5 minutes after the second dose which didn?t happen the first time so quickly. It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

Around 2:30am felt pressure and warmth (coming in waves) up towards my chest, lasting 1-2 seconds and occurring about every 5 minutes . Was able to withstand feeling until it became difficult to breath. Lips and face turned white and blue, fainted. Felt extremely nausea when awake.  Called 911. Vitals were normal apart from BP was very high 130/100&#39;s. EKG was NSR. Blood sugar taken was normal around 113. After 1 hour of event, I took a shower and drank water. I felt the wave one more time before trying to fall asleep. Then stopped. Woke up fine.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Over the course of the rest of that day, I began to develop a headache and mild neck soreness. That night, I slept poorly. When I awoke just before 5:00am the next day, Tuesday, January 26, I did not feel well. I was experiencing headache, malaise, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia, and low-grade fever. I called my supervisor around 5:30am that day and we decided it was best that I stay home to recuperate. Throughout the day, I mostly rested and slept, took Tylenol, and began to feel better in the mid-afternoon. I did call and leave a voicemail for hospital Employee Health around 1:30pm on Tuesday the 26th, but did not hear back. Today, Wednesday, January 27, I am feeling much better, and well enough to come to work.

About 6 hrs after vaccine, I felt soreness at the injection site, very similar to the flu vaccine. About 12Hours post vaccine, my arm was so sore I could not lift it. That night I took two Tylenol and had to wrap my arm in a heating pad. I woke up around 3am that following morning with a fever of 104 F. I was so dizzy from the high fever. I felt extremely nauseated. My body ached mostly in my legs and lower back. It hurt to sit on the toilet, to put on clothes. My Fevers happened at night time ranging from 102-104F for 4 days. My injection site soreness lasted for 7 days. Body aches lasted around 2-3 days. Dizziness subsided after my fever broke, but was replaced with a severe headache lasting 2 days.

The symptoms were relieved by taking extra strength tylenol every 4 hours. The symptoms were lessened, but still present until 9:30 AM on Wednesday.  I was still suffering from a minor headache all day Thursday. I also had soreness in the injection site, there was no swelling or redness that I noticed; the soreness was mostly gone by Thursday. I have had a left eyelid twitch in the past (randomly), it returned after the vaccine and was very bothersome. Today is Thursday and the eyelid twitch is still bothering me.

                                                syncopal episode; itching; fullness; feeling funny; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable pharmacist. A 30-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EN6198), intramuscular on 19Feb2021 14:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), traumatic brain injury (TBI) from 2007 to an unknown date, vagovasal and hypotension post TBI, Celiac disease, allergy to milk products, diagnosed with COVID-19 from Aug2020 to an unknown date prior to vaccination. It was unknown if the patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medication included famotidine, methylphenidate, fludrocortisone, omeprazole, desvenlafaxine succinate (PRISTIQ), brexpiprazole (REXULTI), and folic acid. The patient was previously vaccinated with the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EL3246) at the age of 30-year-old, intramuscularly for COVID-19 immunisation on 19Jan2021 at 14:15 and experienced heart flutters and &#34;fell faint&#34; (fainted). The patient also previously took ibuprofen and experienced allergies. After approximately 5 minutes after the patient had the second dose of vaccine (19Feb2021 14:20), the patient had syncopal episode, itching/ fullness.

At 14:20 the patient was given Benadryl liquid PO given along with 8oz of water. Patient able to drink without issues. At 15:00, EMS called for ER transport to due prolonged recovery. The events resulted in emergency room/department or urgent care. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the very close temporal association, there was a reasonable possibility that the vaccination with BNT162B2 played a contributory role in triggering the onset of the reported events. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient had a syncopal event preceded by nausea and lightheadedness. EMS evaluated the patient on-site. The patient was pale, diaphoretic, and hypotensive (67/37).  EKG (3/12): Sinus brady, rate 46 bpm, no ST elevation. FSBG (3/12): 89mg/dl. EMS administered 500mL IV saline. EMS transported the patient to Hospital Emergency Department. In the ED, the patient feels back at baseline and was normotensive (119/72). Patient stated they have a history of vasovagal response and vasovagal vomiting, but had never experienced a vasovagal syncope episode. Physician administered 0.5mg Lorazepam. The ED physician admitted the patient to the telemetry unit for vasovagal syncope due to patient&#39;s prodrome and prior history of similar near syncopal episodes. Inpatient attending agreed that the patient&#39;s vasovagal response may be secondary to poor PO intake with extreme stress. Patient&#39;s admission was less than 1-day and stated they were anxious to return home. Discharged with diagnoses of Mild leukocytosis, Vasovagal response, and Orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.

She mentioned when discussing her panic attacks that she thought she was panicking when she got the vaccine but did not have a full panic attack. It was also reported that she got the Covid vaccine on 07Apr2021 at 1250, about an hour after she started throwing up.  She said she has a lot of saliva and mucous coming up and stated it feels like she has a cold. She said she has a runny nose and is spitting up mucous and also she had some diarrhea.

                                                Two days after receiving first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine started feeling generally unwell. On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

Pt complained of a numb throat, and said, &#34;I cant seem to swallow my saliva well.&#34;   This writer did an immediate assessment of patient&#39;s throat with  flashlight, and no swelling, abnormal discharge, or discoloration noted.   Pulse-ox that was available on hand was used on pt, and sats were 96% and HR 78.    MA on site was asked to grab a complete VS machine for somewhere stat, for there was none on site.   This writer reassured pt was going to be okay and to breathe normally, for assessed pt was breathing fast.    This writer called every doctor listed on the &#34;Contact List for COVID Vaccine Clinic,&#34; but there was no response.   This writer then called Urgent Care and Minor Injury Clinic, but the doctors were busy with patients. Asked MAs from those areas to have a doctor call immediately for a patient here was symptomatic.   Once VS got here, VS were taken, and pt was assessed again.    Pt said there was no more numbness in her throat, but tongue was feeling itchy, and her body temp went from hot to cold.    Intitial VS: Temp: 98.3 BP: 122/80 HR: 77 O2: 99% RR: 18   Dr from Urgent Care finally called. Background story given, and she ordered Diphenhydramine Cap 25mg (Benadryl) which this writer had on hand in the emergency kit.   Order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Benadryl given at 1025.   Dr also suggested that ID doctor be called.    At 1030, I got a hold of Dr., gave her a background story, and she advised that the pt stay for another 30 mins to be observed and she would come see the pt.    Dr. arrived at 1100, assessed the patient, and ordered Cetrizine Tab 10mg (Zyrtec) to give to pt, which Dr. had to get from another department. There was no Zyrtec available in emergency kit.   Again, order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Zyrtec given at 1128. An additional Zrytec Tab 10mg was given at same time at 1128 &#34;for home use&#34; per Dr and per her order.    VS set #2 taken at 1133 Temp: 98.1 BP: 133/94 HR: 63 O2: 100% RR: 16   Dr suggested that she schedule an appt to see an allergist and to get an allergy test done prior to the next dose of the COVID vaccine.    Patient was feeling a lot better and more at ease.   Pt left comfortably with no symptoms at 1200.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

Then, 1-14-21 starting around 8am, I developed GI symptoms, stomach cramping, nausea, and also light-headed and muscle aches. I left work and at home developed a headache and fever of 100.8 F which reduced to 100.2 F with ibuprofen. The fever went away over night so I came to work the next day 1/15/21 and continue to have stomach cramping and slight nausea and was concerned about the fever the day before so that is when I called employee health.

Very fatigued. At night I threw up and about 2AM I woke up drenched in sweat and I did not take my temperature. I woke up around 7AM and I had a migraine for about 2/3 hours - pounding headache. I took Tylenol, My body was really achy and my arm was like it was dead. General malaise, fatigue, it felt like I had a hangover, from my pounding headache. I threw up once again in the afternoon. Not sure if pregnancy related or the vaccine. Sunday morning I started feeling a little better. Saturday I felt horrible.

                                                Jan 4, 2021 received shot at work in morning around 11:00 am- felt fine at work all day. Around 7:00 that night began to have back pain, fever reached up to 102 around 2:00 am and took Tylenol. Felt very weak, headache, difficulty walking and decreased balance. On Jan 5, 2021 still had back ache and headache. On Jan 6, 2021 I felt better and began to have abdominal pain after eating dinner. I assumed it may be because of eating more then I had in past few days and did not attribute to much but the pain gradually increased to a strange burning/pressure across my upper abdomen that night. Very nauseous and ran low grade fever (99.45). Next morning I had less diffuse pain and could localize it to right lower quadrant.

The roof of my mouth, and tongue became numb.  I needed to think really hard how to swallow.  It was like I could not figure out how to work that muscle.  I took benadryl, to ease symptoms.  It helped but did not take it away.  Next day, mouth and tongue still numb, and my ears, eyes, nose and throat were itchy.  My external skin was also itchy.  My doctor put me on a steroid pack. 4 days later, I am doing much better still not 100% percent myself, but very close to being back to normal. Still have slight sensation in tongue.

I have had an uncomplicated pregnancy. About 12 hours after vaccination, I woke up in the middle of the night around 2:30am with chills and body aches and had a temperature of 100.7.  I also had a headache, soreness at the site of injection, and a mild stomach ache. I took Tylenol every 6 hours starting 1 hour prior to vaccination and throughout the next day but continued to have temperatures ranging from 100.4 to 101.3 associated with chills, body aches, headache, and severe fatigue.  I continued to have these symptoms until about 9pm that night. Once the fever broke, the majority of symptoms subsided, but I did continue to have a daily headache for about one week after the vaccine.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

I had malaise a few hours after the shot. 12 hours after the shot, this turned into a fever that would peak at 103 within the next 12 hours. Fever was accompanied by severe chills, moderate headache, moderate muscle aches, mild joint aches, and mild nausea. I also had a swollen lymph node under my armpit ipsilateral to the injection, the diameter of a baseball. Discomfort from the lymph node was mild. The fever and chills were so bad that I couldn&#39;t do any daily activities and stayed in bed all day. I called a nurses line to ask them if I could take something for the discomfort and they advised Tylenol, so I took 1000 mg. Tylenol did bring down the fever to 101 and the fever rose back to 103, 9 hours after Tylenol. All the aforementioned symptoms lasted for 3 days, and the severe symptoms decreased in severity to &#34;moderate&#34; after about 36 hours.

A 31-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EK9231, expiry: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 11Jan2021 11:45 on the left arm at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient received the vaccine in a hospital. The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. Medical history included clinical depression. The patient has no known allergies. The patient was not tested for COVID prior and post vaccination. Concomitant medications included bupropion and multivitamin. The patient previously took the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot: EK5730, expiry: unknown) on 21Dec2020 at 11:00 in the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. On 12Jan2021 at 01:00, the patient experienced severe rigors involving core and extremities, making it difficult to breathe. Flexeril 10 mg was taken to help relieve rigors. Rigors stopped and ease of breathing resumed in 1 hour. Other symptoms include muscle pain, joint pain noted in hips, loss of appetite, and profound fatigue x48 hrs. The events difficult breathing, muscle pain, joint pain noted in hips, loss of appetite and profound fatigue were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovering.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

A 31-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Batch/lot number: EL3247, Expiry date 31May2021, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 16Jan2021 at 07:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization as frontline worker. The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events &#34;Pain injection site&#34; and &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; as non-serious and assessed the event &#34;Can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; as disabling. She assessed all the reported events as related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events numbness of upper extremity and arm paralysis with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Acute appendicitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting for herself. A 31-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EK4176), intramuscular in the left arm, on 16Jan2021 at 18:30, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included iron deficiency anaemia, migraine and drug allergy to amoxicillin. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included multivitamin and ferrous sulfate (unknown manufacturer). Previously the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EH9899), on 26Dec2020 at 04:15 PM, intramuscular in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced acute appendicitis on 20Jan2021 at 09:00 with outcome of recovering. The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized due to the event in Jan2021 for 1 day. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 PCR test (nasal swab): negative on 20Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Given the nature of the medical condition and the overall clinical picture, the event appendicitis is most likely an intercurrent medical condition and is assessed as unrelated to bnt162b2.

                                                Received vaccine at Covid-19 pop-up clinic on 4/5/21 at 2:30pm. Was fine during the vaccine administration. Waited 30 minutes after vaccination and left the clinic and felt fine. About 15-30 minutes later she was driving around running errands and was drinking water in the car and she noticed that it was becoming hard to swallow. Felt dizzy and disoriented and called her allergist. She carries epi pen because she gets allergy shots due to dog and cat allergies. Epi pen is for potential reaction to allergy shot. Allergist advised her to call EMS. She called EMS and they told her to administer the epi pen. She administered epi pen and began to feel symptoms improve. EMS arrived and she felt better and was not transported to the hospital. She drove herself home and was fine the rest of the day. She also had a topical reaction to the band-aid on her arm, with blisters and ripping off her skin. She generally has allergy issues with adhesives.

Fatigue has gone down to where I can resume daily activity  12/29 Wake up with moderate sore throat Stabbing arm soreness at injection site Moderate fatigue  and nausea persist. Mild chills. Tried to go for a walk outside and found a 30 minute very slow walk extremely tough  12/30-1/2 Moderate sore throat continues. Other symptoms gone 1/1-2 Arm/ injection site soreness slowly fades  1/2: exercise for the day= 70 min yoga and 7.5 miles of walking. Had a couple glasses of wine at dinner (possibly relevant if issues with vaccine are related to high histamine food issues)  1/3  Moderate headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Skin feels hot. Sore throat worse than the previous days. Mild runny nose. Severe nausea. Go to Urgent care for COVID test and Zofran Rx. COVID rapid test and PCR test both negative.

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving my second dose I became flush, and hot from the outside in over my whole body.  I was tingly all over.  I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

At about 12 hours post-vaccine I developed nausea, fever (100.4) and chills and secondary to this had poor sleep. The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (04Jan2021), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital.  Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome.  Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), famotidine (PEPCID), ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (CILIQUE) for birth control and multivitamin. It was stated that the patient got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. On 17Dec2020, she developed severe abdominal pain radiating to her upper and her middle back with pretty bad nausea, fatigue and headache. It was also mentioned that the patient had stomach cramps. These continued all the way until like Christmas. And then on the 19Dec2020, she actually got her menstrual cycle though she was not due to start that till that week. So, it came like almost two and a half weeks early (which was super weird as for her). The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX); famotidine and hyoscyamine for like stomach cramping. She also took that as well, acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). It was mentioned that the symptoms stopped on 26Dec2020 then she sinus infection right after in Dec 2020. Outcome of the event of sinus infection was unknown while the remaining events recovered on 26Dec2020. The patient stated that the she don&#39;t think that sinus infection was correlated at all but all other symptoms were happening right after the vaccine (reported as related).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event sinus infection is likely intercurrent and is unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

                                                24 weeks pregnant at time of 2nd shot. Shot given at 1430 on 1/27 in left deltoid. Felt great rest of day. @0500 on 1/28 woke up shivering uncontrollably. Mild fever of 100.5(highest recorded during this whole episode). Body aches, chills, sweats, headache rest of day. 1000 mg Tylenol helped with fever/chills but headache progressed to migraine w/nausea. Took 50 mg sumatriptan and 25 mg doxylamine in evening and this seemed to help with headache and allow me to get to sleep 1/28.  Woke up at 0300 1/29 with chills/cold sweats. Took 1000 mg Tylenol again (didn&#39;t check temp) and went back to sleep. Woke up at 0530 for work - checked temp since I&#39;m a healthcare worker and it was 100.4 (with tylenol). Waited until clinic opened up and called them at 0700 for recommendations on going to work or not (temp by then was 99.8, with tylenol). Was advised to stay home and if febrile tomorrow to get COVID tested on 1/30. As of right now (1300 on 1/29) headache has returned but mild. Body aches still. Temp 99.4 w/tylenol redosed at 1000.

This turned into extreme dizziness and nausea. I was unable to drive distances for this reason. Nor walk straight. It subsided slightly right before my second dose.

By 1500 I had severe nausea which resulted in vomiting (water and dry heaving) with a small amount of blood (small clots) with first time vomiting. Then at 1700 I could barely move with severe body aches and headache. Attempted to drink some water and eat soup, but intestines burned too much. Slept from 0800 on 1/28/21 through till 0830 on 1/29/21 with very minimal waking. Only left my bed to throw up one time and use the restroom one time. Took Tylenol around the clock. Upon waking on 1/29/21 noticed a petechiae type rash on both sides of my face, sore throat and mild headache (took tylenol). 1/30/21 no symptoms and facial rash slowly disappearing.

Medical history included diabetes, asthma and known allergies: neutrogena products. Concomitant medication included metformin and ibuprofen (ADVIL [IBUPROFEN]). On 22Jan2021 01:20 am the patient woke up from severe itching and pain. The patient had developed a rash on her back and stomach felt like fire ants were crawling and biting her. The only thing that came to her mind was taking an oral antihistamine so she took diphenhydramine (BENADRYL), the rash and itching was gone in the morning on Friday she had a discussion with the physician she worked with to let him know what had happened, to get his opinion on if she should get the 2nd vaccine. She took another diphenhydramine the Friday night just in case no itching didn&#39;t take diphenhydramine on Saturday however the itching returned on Sunday the late afternoon approx at 4pm took another diphenhydramine but still feeling a little itching the back and stomach (no new foods lotions soaps or supplements were started so it had to be the vaccine). The facility where the vaccine was administered was in a hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Patient was not pregnant. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Post vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. Outcome of the events was recovering.

A 32-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; batch/lot number and expiration date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm on 05Jan2021 10:15 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization at a hospital. Medical history included idiopathic hypersomnia and allergies to eggplant. The patient has no covid prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included methylphenidate hydrochloride (CONCERTA), methenamine, levonorgestrel (MIRENA), propranolol hydrochloride (PROPRANOL) and vitamin c [ascorbic acid] (VITAMIN C [ASCORBIC ACID]). The patient had no other vaccine in four weeks. The patient previously took cefazolin and levaquin and experienced allergies to both. The patient has a Mirena IUD and never get her period at all. Within 6 hours of her first Pfizer injection (02Feb2021 16:00), the patient experienced crippling lower abdominal pain followed by very very heavy bleeding and clotting. Resolved within 48 hours as quickly as it came and didn&#39;t occur with second dose 1 week out. The patient was not tested for Covid post vaccination. The events were not treated. The outcome of the events was recovered on 04Feb2021.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information and known drug profile it  is unlikely that the reported events were causally  related to   BNT162B2.  These are intercurrent  conditions.   A contributory role of the patient&#39;s Mirena IUD  should be  evaluated.  Case will be reassessed if additional information is received.   The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I lost my appetite  but wasn&#39;t vomiting or having nausea. I had a migraine and fever and body aches and chills (I was either freezing or hot) - couldn&#39;t get warm enough - these symptoms I noticed about midnight - it woke me up after a couple hours of sleep and then I couldn&#39;t sleep. These symptoms lasted through to Monday. Tuesday, I wasn&#39;t feeling fantastic but I went back to work. Fever broke on Sunday morning. Migraine lasted five days. I took Tylenol for fever and ibuprofen for other symptoms. I had a virtual Dr appt on Friday, the 8th. I took migraine medicine but it wasn&#39;t really helping. I met again with Dr on 11th - virtual. I chose to go back work even though I wasn&#39;t better - felt fatigue and the headache on and off for a couple of weeks. Just since the beginning of February do I feel like fatigue has gone away.  When I work out, I do still notice that I get tired faster.

                                                Immediately after getting the vaccine, I noticed a strong metallic taste in my mouth. The metallic taste lasted for approximately 5 days, decreasing in strength over time. Within 10-15 minutes of getting the vaccine, parts of my face went partially numb (primarily under my lips and along my right cheek). The numbness was largely improved after 1.5 weeks, but I continue to experience it intermittently 3&#43; weeks later. I also had severe jaw pain that lasted for about 2 weeks, on and off. Within about an hour of receiving the vaccine, I noticed a small amount of rectal bleeding as well; this resolved within the same day. Beyond that, my symptoms were &#34;normal&#34; -- pain at the injection site, mild nausea and chills on the day of the vaccine. I spoke with 5 different doctors about the facial numbness, and none of them were able to advise me on why that might have happened. My primary care physician recommended against getting the second shot until we have more information about what would cause these side effects.

                                                Within 2 minutes of vaccine receipt the patient became agitated. She was noted to have erythematous macules on her upper back consistent with hives. Her heart rate and respiration rates were normal. She was observed initially as the family reported that she gets hives with all injections. However, about 2 minutes later she began to retch and stated that her throat was burning and she couldn&#39;t breathe. She was administered 0.3mg of epinephrine via an autoinjector. Her shortness of breath and throat burning symptoms resolved almost immediately. She was then given 10mg of Cetirizine PO and transported via local EMS for evaluation at the Hospital ED.

PATIENT RESPONDED &#34;NO, JUST ACHY JOINTS AND SWEATING.&#34; AT THAT POINT SHE HAD ANAPHYLACTIC SYMPTOMS. INFORMED PATIENT I COULD GIVE HER SOME TYLENOL FOR THE PAIN. TOLD HER TO GO HOME AND RELAX. INFORMED PATIENT I WOULD CALL HER IN 30 MINUTES TO CHECK IN. 30 MINUTES LATER I CALLED PATIENT AND NO ANSWER AND LEFT VOICE MAIL. 1 HOUR LATER CALLED AGAIN AND NO ANSWER AND LEFT ANOTHER VOICEMAIL. PATIENT CALLED 2-3 HOURS AFTER GOING HOME STATING SHE REPORTED TO &#34;HOSPITAL.&#34; SAID SHE STARTED TO DEVELOP DIZZINESS, SWEATING, MORE JOINT PAIN, NAUSEA, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH &#34;BUT MAY BE DUE TO NERVOUSNESS.&#34; I ASKED PATIENT ABOUT RECONSIDERING SECOND DOSE OF VACCINE, BUT SHE THEN SAID &#34;THE HOSPITAL STILL RECOMMENDS ME GETTING THE SECOND DOSE.&#34; THEREFORE LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS NOT A REAL IMMUNE RESPONSE BUT A PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSE.

I had body aches those went away the soreness in my arm went away but then when they went away my chest started to burn I started hacking up thick brown gray stuff growing up and having abdominal pain from time to time I just need to know if the vaccine can cause flare-ups and people with an autoimmune disease or disorder.

The chills went away after the first day. The 2nd day I still had a fever. Day 3 I had significant nausea in conjunction with headache. These symptoms have continued from days 4 - today, day 11 post vaccine. While they are improving, after the initial fever/ chills my symptoms translated to into seemingly hormonal with nausea, strong food aversions, headaches (that felt hormonal) and 4&#43; days with substantial constipation and fatigue. It has mirrored the sickness I experienced with both pregnancies however I am not pregnant. I am still experiencing a mixture of fatigue,  headaches, nausea and food aversions (food still does not taste normal).

                                                About 12 hours after I received the second dose of the covid vaccine, I started to get severe chills and headache followed by fever that lasted all night and was up to 101.4 F.  The fever improved this morning around 9 am, however I continued to have headache, myalgia, and fatigue all day.  I also have intermittent nausea and difficulty standing or walking around because of feeling like I will pass out.  I feel slightly improved tonight but still not normal.  I called the employee health this morning to inform them.

On 1/8/21 at around 10:00am I got a headache of moderate severity behind my right eye and at right temple.  It was associated with nausea and fatigue.  I took 800mg ibuprofen and 4mg zofran.  At 12:00 I left work and went home and slept for 4.5 hours between 12:30 and 5pm.  I woke up at 5pm and had minimal residual headache in the right temple.  After going to sleep from 8pm to 6am, I awoke on 1/9/21 and my headache was completely resolved.    I do have a history of migraine headaches.  This headache and associated nausea felt like my previous migraine headaches and the course was similar to my previous headaches.

Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

Intermittently unable to talk in full sentences with ambulation one-day post administration. Shortness of breath generally resolved with sitting down, lasted 72 hours in total, and was accompanied by fatigue, chills, body aches, stomach cramps, and headache.

I took 650 mg Tylenol, fell back asleep, woke up at 330 am sweating and less achy. Awoke again at 7 am with terrible headache, nausea and upset stomach. Injection site swollen, reddened and painful to touch; took another 650 mg of Tylenol without much relief. Entire body was extremely sensitive to the slightest bit of touch or pressure. Had a hazy feeling in my head, felt mildly dizzy for hours. Around 230 pm on 1/19/21 I began sweating profusely for about 15 minutes and when that ceased  I felt almost back to normal immediately. By the following day I was feeling 100% OK other than injection site discomfort. Today, 1/23, is the first day since receiving my second dose that my arm Only slightly hurts and itches.

                                                Starting several hours after getting the second vaccination I started to experience systemic myalgias, arthrias, and chills.  It got to the point where it was difficult to type.  I left work early that day.  The following morning, 01/14/21, I woke around 06:30 with searing, shooting pains systemically.  There were severe nausea, chills, and fatigue.  I was unable to get out of bed for the better half of the day and took a sick day.  I was able to go into work, 01/15/21, but continued to experience extreme fatigue, cognitive blunting, chills, arthralgias, and myalgias.  Over that weekend I slept 12&#43; hours each day and into MLK day, 01/18/21.  I went into work on 01/19/20 and continued to experience ongoing fatigue (difficult to walk from my office to the bathroom down the hall), chills, the nausea appeared to return, and intermittent chills/arthralgias/myalgias.  I spoke with the physician at the hospital and he directed me to get tested for COVID.  Details below.  This was on 01/19/21.  I continues to experience these symptoms throughout this week: 01/20-01/22/12.  The interval between the chills/arthralgias/myalgias is increasing but the nausea appears to be lingering.  Chills have basically resolved.

                                                Approximately an hour after receiving he shot I began experiencing early signs of a headache, and slight fatigue which slowly increased throughout the evening. I woke at 1am (approx. 10 hours after receiving the second Pfizer vaccine) shaking  and shivering uncontrollably, freezing and at times convulsing. I was experiencing mild nausea and was unsure if I was having a  seizure due to level of shaking and convulsing. Through approx. 4pm the next day I was running a high fever, was almost incapable of speaking or moving due to level of fatigue and weakness. After my fever broke i remained feeling sick through the following day. I needed to take advil for the following 3 or 4 days to manage continual headache, and mild body aches.

After symptoms resolved, I did not notice my arm where I received the injection was very sore. This lasted another 3-4 days after feeling better, so about 10-12 days after the vaccine was given.

After second dose of Pfizer, the swelling and pain in the neck escallated and three nodules were discovered in my neck at ER visit due to pain from neck and radiating in ears and head. Extremely fatigued and headache was unbearable. ER MD discovered nodules, high white blood count, etc. Sent to follow up with Endo. Endo could not explain. Thyroid labs are all normal but the symptoms and nodules makes this suspicious. ANother ER visit with 3 days hospitalization due to pain and now elevated pulse (even while sitting in ER bed at 135-140 pulse). Low grade fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargic, elevated labs, etc.  Now on propranolol for heart regulation and prednisone to monitor. Multiple CT scans and Ultrasound confirmed the nodules.

                                                I ultimately suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis and was hospitalized for 5 days due to brain and spine inflammation.  I had numbness in my feet 2 days after my vaccine, then suffered from dizziness and nausea 3 days after my vaccine, and had face paralysis 4 days after my vaccine. I went to the ER 4 days after the vaccine and was told I have Bell&#39;s Palsy and Vertigo. I was prescribed oral steroids and anti-nausea medicine. In the following weeks, I had more tingleness/numbness of the legs, brain fog and confusion, blurred vision, unsteady gait, loss of balance, blurred vision and leg muscle weakness, increased anxiety, hearing sensitivity, lethargy, sleeplessness, 6th cranial nerve palsy, tingles in the face, and headaches. I finally got an MRI and when doctor?s saw the MRI results 3 days later, I was told to go to the ER immediately because I had brain and spine inflammation that needed treatment, and was diagnosed with ADEM. I then spent 5 days in the hospital to receive intravenous steroids and monitoring. During this stay, I had more MRIs and a lumbar puncture. I was released on oral steroids for 25 days, as well as follow up appointments and monitoring progress in recovery. Inflammation has decreased. I continue to have tingleness in lower extremities, headaches, pain in legs, and sensitive hearing.

It started at 100 and within a minute was at 130. I finally honked my horn for assistance and my symptoms continued. I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

I was feeling better by the 21st and now symptoms have resolved.

It lasted until about 24 hours after the vaccine. Over the last week, I?ve had horrible insomnia, waking up multiple times throughout the night with difficulty falling back asleep. I didn?t think much of it other than it?s very unlike me until a handful of other coworkers vaccinated around the same have also been experiencing this.

All symptoms resolved after 48 hours.  I am a person and wanted the reaction information to be part of the trial data.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

A 34-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via intramuscular (lot number: EL1283) on left arm on 08Jan2021 at 6:30 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included celiac, anemia, known allergies: Sulfa and Gluten. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 via intramuscular (lot number: Ek5730) on left leg on 18Dec2020 at 11:00 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient previously took Codeine, fish oil and experienced allergies. Friday at 3pm, the patient had numbness and tingling to left hand, lips and throat. On Saturday the patient had sweating, chills, headache, nausea. On Sunday had emergency appendectomy for actuate appendicitis. Post surgery had allergic reaction unknown reason with head to toe rash.

Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 in 2020 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for Crohn&#39;s disease.  The reporter is a physician who is reporting and AE for a patient who received the vaccine and subsequently developed symptoms including short of breath, fever, headache, nausea, difficulty swallowing with seriousness criteria of Medically significant on 03Jan2021. The patient self-medicated with benadryl and symptoms resolved briefly but then went to urgent care with re-occurring symptoms and was prescribed prednisone. Caller states the patient&#39;s symptoms have resolved. She is calling to get more information to determine if the patient should receive the second dose. The reporter further stated that she has a patient who received her first shot, clarified as the COVID-19 Vaccine. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the patient had shortness of breath and then later had a fever, headache and nausea. It was later that night when the patient had a fever. The patient had difficulty swallowing which worsen; she was feeling as if her throat was closing. The patient is a nurse, so she self medicated with Benadryl. After taking the Benadryl, the patient was better in the early morning. When the doctor&#39;s office opened, the patient called and was having similar symptoms, clarified as all the symptoms mentioned above. The patient went to the urgent care where she received more Benadryl and was started on prednisone. Caller did not know the dose of prednisone the patient had received. After that, the patient started feeling better. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID19 Vaccine is due around 24 to 26Jan2021. The patient has not called the doctor/caller back.

At ~ 0500 on 1/14/21 (~18 hrs after vaccine), I woke up as I was in SVT. I was not able to convert myself and had to go to ED for treatment. HR was 232 upon arrival to ED. Prior to administering adenosine, SVT resolved on own. SVT episode lasted ~2hrs.  I have not had a prolonged SVT episode since ablation in 2016. ER doc mentioned that perhaps fever/ illness from vaccine lowered my threshold for going into SVT.

                                                Two hours after vaccine, I felt abdominal pain and felt like I was going to get diarrhea and I got really flushed; shaky; face red. They put ice on back of neck. Arm started to hurt. Took Tylenol and sat down. And felt better 15 minutes later. Intervention was ice on back of neck so I wouldn&#39;t faint and rest. Overnight, first night - chills. Woke up with a headache. Took ibuprofen and Tylenol and had body ache and joint pain, too. Five days consistently (positionally) - when I laid down I would get it for five days. I had the vertigo which started 2 days after vaccine. Had a migraine 7 days after vaccine and I had to miss work because it was so severe. Had a typical migraine. Had an aura and it was so bad I couldn&#39;t see to drive to work. I don&#39;t ever get vertigo with my migraines and so this was different. After 7 days all symptoms were resolved. I am currently breastfeeding.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

                                                The evening of the day I got the shot, I began to get tired and started to have a sore arm.  Throughout the night, the arm soreness got worse and I got joint pain.  The whole next day, I experienced severe malaise, headache, chills, fever, and joint pain with the site soreness.    The arm pain got worse.  That night, I struggled to sleep.  The whole day after that, I had less malaise and the fever had gone down but the injection site reddened and grew even warmer and more tender.  That evening it was difficult to sleep as the soreness in my arm migrated to the shoulder, armpit and the right side of my chest, along where a bra band would go on the distal right side of the chest.  The next morning (today) the entire armpit area and upper distal right side of the chest were hot and tender.  This afternoon, I palpated the area and noticed at least one swollen lymph node.  My arm still hurts.

Now approx 18 hrs from the initial onset  it hurts my chest when I swallow  and it passes through my esophagus. I?m really apprehensive about taking the other shot.

The following morning, I continued to have numbness in my hands but also in my face. By the evening , the day after I had received the vaccine, I felt like my swallowing was slightly impaired and I went to urgent care. I was able to complete all neurological tests and given a prescription for hydroxyzine, thinking that I may have had a slight histamine response.  I slept approximately 10 hours that night and then fell asleep again from 8:30-11:30 this morning due to high levels of fatigue. Today (~54 hours later), the numbness in my hands and face seems to be getting slightly worse.  I also feel some generalized weakness. I&#39;m still able to do normal day to day activities but it feels abnormal.

                                                Vaccination was at 9:17am. Injection site arm pain and stiffness was noticeable by 12pm, and gradually worsened to incredibly painful by 8 pm, especially in muscles between left  shoulder blade and spine. Chills began around 9:30pm at which point I took one 500mg Tylenol and went to sleep. I woke up with severe chills around 1:45 am and pushed off taking more 500mg Tylenol until 2:45 am. Afterwards I began to feel heartburn and slight nausea but was able to fall back to sleep. I woke up around 3:45 am to vomit. Afterwards, the nausea subsided and I was able to go back to sleep until 6:45am. I woke up with a headache which got worse and I took one Aleve at 9 am. By late afternoon I was feeling much better.

It felt as though severe pain where kidneys were but it ended up being debilitating back pain; had to miss work. Symptoms lasted for 3 days. My back pain lasted for about a week. Vomiting was for 3 days. I did seek medical attention; zofran and flexeril.  *urgent care **not taking 2nd vaccination. Personal preference. &#39;Not worth it to go thru that again&#39;.

                                                First vaccine I could feel the vaccine go into my body and down into my legs. It was a very strange sensation. I felt very fatigued 30 min after the vaccine but ignored it because it was not normal to have symptoms after the first vaccine. That night i did feel a litlle bit of swelling in my lips that continued into the next day but it was not severe. The muscle aches, joint pain and allodynia the 2nd day were so severe I don&#39;t really remember any other symptoms i may have had. I took Benadryl and Tylenol and slept for 2 days straight. After the 1st vaccine I did have shortness of breath for about 3 days post. Then I received the 2nd vaccine, I did not feel it go in this time. About 30 min after the second vaccine I felt very fatigued. About an hour later I started to feel slight swelling in my lips that increased and around 2 1/2 hours my eyes and lips were noticeably swollen and I was flushed. My husband noticed my ears and cheeks were bright red.   I felt my heart racing and took my pulse it was around 120. I felt dizzy and like there was a lump in my throat.   I requested an appointment via video call from  the emergency line.  I  didn&#39;t feel like I was having trouble breathing and stayed calm, my pulse went down to 100 after about 20 min. while waiting for my video call. I spoke to the doctor and they recommended going to the ER. I asked since the pulse went down and it felt like I was slowly reacting, if I could try taking Benadryl and see how I felt. She said that was ok but if I felt any difficulty breathing to go to  the ER right away. I took 50 mg of Benadryl and felt better and rested. The next morning lips and eyes were swollen again but a little worse. Difficulty swallowing persisted as well as severe muscle pain, joint pain, and allodynia.  The symptoms were worse with 2nd vaccine. Noticed shortness of breath just walking up and down steps. These symptoms lasted a little bit longer.  4 days after the vaccine I noticed  the lip swelling was not getting better so I called my PCP. He recommended taking the next 2 days off , rest with benadryl and tylenol. I listened and felt good enough to go into work. It is now 4 weeks since i had the vaccine and i am still experiencing  some symptoms that seem to be in relation to after i eat. That includes lip swelling, tightness in the muscles around my throat (feel as if they are strained), stomach burning, indigestion, heartburn.  Called PCP again who recommended I see an allergist/immunologist.

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

                                                12 hours post vaccine developed severe muscle and bone pain and a fever, took 1000 mg of Tylenol 17 hours post vaccine and the fever broke, but the pain persisted. Took Ibuprofen 20 hours post vaccine because I developed a severe headache in addition to nausea. Headache became less intense, but all other symptoms remained at the same intensity. I fell asleep and woke up with a 103F at 28 hours. Pain persisted as well. I went back to sleep and woke up at 7pm when the fever broke, I noticed all the other symptoms were gone except for some new neck pain. The neck pain could be related to how I slept though since it was new. I did not take any more medication and went back to bed later in the evening. I woke up at 4am, roughly 29 hours post vaccine, with a fever and didn&#39;t take my temperature, but did take 1000 mg Tylenol. It broke an hour later. I have had waves of symptoms of a low grade fever all day (slight chills), which then feels like it breaks on its own indicated by sweat and chills disappearing. I haven&#39;t had to medicate any further however and in comparison to yesterday I feel amazing!

A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient had not received any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the BNT162B2 vaccine. Relevant medical history and concomitant medications were none. On 25Dec2020, the patient felt extremely tired (fatigue). On 28Dec2020, the patient had headache and minor cough noticed. On 29Dec2020, the patient experienced back pain and she said that it felt like sunburn soreness more than anything else. She said that she literally slept 3 days in a row (29Dec2020, 30Dec2020, and 31Dec2020).  On 31Dec2020, the patient lost her sense of smell and developed dizziness. On 01Jan2021, the patient experienced nausea and lost her sense of taste.

Clinical outcome of the events, smell loss, cough, headache, and loss of taste was recovering. Final clinical outcome of positive COVID-19 test with symptoms was unknown at time of this report. The case was assessed as serious (medically significant). She is scheduled to get 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine) on 13Jan2021 and is wanting to know if she is supposed to get it.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of events Drug ineffective and COVID-19 cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

                                                I started to feel rundown/fatigued in the evening on the day I got the vaccine and my arm was very sore.  I woke up very early the next morning with a fever of 101-102, body aches, severe headache, nausea, chills, severe fatigue, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, I would get tunnel vision, my eyes ached and felt very strained, sinus congestion and pressure.  My fever spiked at 103.6 that evening and then stayed below 100 after that.  For the following 7 days I still had the severe fatigue, nausea, headaches, chills, dizziness, difficult concentrating, tunnel vision that was especially  bad when I had to drive, eye aches, sinus congestion and pressure, and my head felt very strange.  The best way to describe it is that I felt like someone had drugged me.  The only time I would leave my house was to take my daughter to school and when I would drive my head would feel super tight, my eye ache would intensify and they would feel super strained, I would get the tunnel vision and I would have trouble making it to the school and back home.  Then I would go back to sleep for several hours, get up and drink some fluids and go back to bed.  On day 7 or 8 I was able to stay up for periods of time and either watch movies or just lay in bed.  I went back to work on 1/20 and am doing desk work.  I am doing a lot better but still have daily headaches, moderate fatigue that is worse in the morning, mild intermittent nausea, my head still feels weird like I&#39;ve been taking some kind of pain med or mild sedative, and I&#39;m easily exhausted.  I have trouble going grocery shopping because I get exhausted.  I had a rapid COVID test done on 1/06/20 due to a headache and temp of 99.6-100.2, it was negative and we thought the temp was due to the Trokendi as that is a side effect of it.  I also had a PCR done on 1/12 that came back negative.

                                                On Saturday, January 23, 2021 I woke up around 5:30 in the morning with itchy hands and feet, after my second dose/ Just as I did with my first dose- Which subsided with Benadryl. However the second dose was given Thursday, January 21. The progressing of the itchy hands and feet lead to my bottom lip swelling excessively large , my tongue begin to swell, my upper lip begin to swell, my lungs begin to burn in my airway begin to tighten. I took two Benadryl and called my family to call 911 and take me to the emergency room. My blood pressure was very low pulse was very high. I had genital pain and swelling, dizziness , nausea vomiting, and extreme body pain. I was given epinephrine, breathing treatments, steroids, Benadryl, and IV fluids. Labs were drawn and my creatinine was high. After about four hours the swelling has gone down and I was able to go home. I have to take steroids for three days, Benadryl for seven , and famotidine.  I have no history of severe allergies, in fact I was tested for food and environmental allergies about a year ago and everything came back negative. I have no history of reacting to any vaccine at any time.

                                                After 24 hours of receiving vaccine, I started getting numbness in my left arm (arm that received injection). Numbness felt like it was beginning from my elbow and going down to my fingertips. My left hand was noticeably colder than my right hand. 48 hours after injection, I started getting numbness in my left leg. Starting from my knee, down to my toes. My left foot was noticeably colder than my right foot. Both my elbow and knee feel swollen even though they don&#39;t look swollen. I tend to lay on my right side at night so I don&#39;t think I slept on it wrong. I get the numbness and tingling feeling randomly regardless of standing, sitting or laying down. It doesn&#39;t hurt but feels very uncomfortable. 48 hours after injection I felt nauseated, and felt like I had muscle weakness in both arms. I was extremely tired. I did have to take a child to the ER on the same day I received the vaccine (for a gastrointestinal virus that lead to dehydration). My 14 month old ended up with the same virus (uncontrolled nausea) two days later. I may have been fighting that virus even though I never threw up. No fever or redness at injection site. The numbness and tingling on my left side (including random spasms in my ribs) has continued for 96 hours since vaccine.

By 24 hours post-vaccine, I developed a fever of 100.8, a headache, and swollen lymph nodes.  By 36 hours, my fever broke, diarrhea discontinued, and the headache subsided.  The body aches, nausea, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes continue to inhibit my ability to perform ADLs and I was unable to work today.

There was light headed sensation w/ movement and position, pressure in my head felt like my head was going to explode and my eyes were burning.  Because so severe, I took 1000mg tylenol, lathered by entire body in eucalyptus oil and peppermint on my hands, I was able to fall asleep at 3am but it was restless sleep I kept waking up because any movement I made in bed I&#39;d have severe pain.  6am I felt moderately better all symptoms 50% improved, applied eucalyptus oil on again, started work at 730am I could barely function at work I have brain fog, just thinking focusing eyes concentrating makes migraine worse, &#43;photopphobia, phonophobia, just typing is very hard to do because it hurts my joints, the vertigo worsened and the slightest looking down to the keyboard while typing causes lightheaded sensation.  No improvement and it&#39;s now almost 1pm.  I didn&#39;t take any pain medication or apply any essential oils.

She went to the ER; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This nurse reported for a 35-year-old female patient (Daughter) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 Vaccine lot number: EK9231, Expiry date: Apr2021) on 16Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported was She was positive, our whole family had COVID and we all came down which was about the same time which was 29Dec. Concomitant drug were not reported. Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am calling for my daughter. She received her 2nd vaccination yesterday morning and she had some side effects. Like about 6 o&#39;clock this morning she came in, she came in 6:35, she came and woke me up and said that she felt some of the reaction she is having. She has nausea, she has slight temperature 99.7, fatigue. Just a general feeling of aches and pains. It does not seem like it&#39;s an emergency. She was treated in the ER with steroids and since that point we have all recovered until she went for the 2nd. She works in a hospital, she got her 2nd dose of vaccine like I said yesterday morning. &#34;Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am not sure causality. I mean it is not an emergency. She was feeling fine yesterday. We all are feeling better now. She had the vaccine and last night she said she had a sore throat when I looked at her throat. Her throat seemed red but there was no angioedema or anything like that, she went to sleep and she came in &#39;feeling really&#39; (voice distortion) sick. So, I do not know. Did they have relapses from the COVID? I do not know.&#34; Treatment was &#34;Tylenol.&#34; Like I had said that she was feeling heavy with her chest. She went to the ER. She was at her work. She went to the ER.&#34; &#34;Probably close to 10 days ago, they did lab work I think they might have been looking for a clot. They did do some lab work at the hospital with unknown results.&#34; Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

I also had a metal taste in my mouth. Before the rapid heart rate started, j bad chills, diarrhea and slight body aches. For about four to five hours my heart rate resting would be 60&#39;s and when a spell came on it would rise up to high 90&#39;s. It did this off and on every couple of minutes for about four to five hours. It was a very scary situation to be in: I can handle the chills, bod aches and diarrhea but when it comes to my heart rate bouncing around and taking my breath away, that was scary.

During the ride I regurgiatated because my stomach got queezy and was administered Zofran.  My right hand turned completely white and I was administered another med to help turn my hand back right.  My baby was checked and she was fine and was released after about 3 hrs.  At that time I was 31 week gestation.  Until about 3 days ago my body was still very very itchy all over which seemed to worsen when I was sleep.

                                                Injection received at 0815. At 0900 I started getting diaphoretic, clammy, nauseas and my face was flushed. At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

                                                I worked the night of 18th and 19th (night shift nurse) -  night of 18th  - arm very sore (dominant arm where shot was taken) by end of night arm was sore; continued for several days. (Got my period either the night of 18th or morning of 19th). About 36 hours after vaccine; stood up to attend an alarm and felt very ill at patient&#39;s bedside and had to sit down: nauseous (felt similar to co-vid) - took Motrin an hour later; the day of 20th - slept all day; 21st - no appetite; mild headache - nauseous - period at same time of vaccine; 22nd - felt bleh; didn&#39;t eat much food - period going away but I  was feeling worse; feel like I have the return of internal vibrations (can sit in my hands when I&#39;m trying to do something for a patient that needs done quickly)  back in July when I had Co-Vid (when I was out of work out of month - and had to see a cardiologist - two months until normal (neural and cardiac symptoms that went away with time) - so was returning of buzzing/etc. 23rd: could feel like I had internal vibrations sensations; nauseous - increased - got a refill from an old dental prescription - started Zofran; headache pressure (head pressure); a vertigo-ish feeling - felt like I just walked off a boat; at that point - called out of work - COVID hotline hospital call - did a rapid test that was negative (on 24th) and on 24th: had still all the same symptoms - nausea was worse and felt a bit more dizzy occasionally and called out of work again but could take care of myself (laid around) - &#34; it felt like baby covid&#34; 25th - work wanted me to get tested again; 26th - Panther Co-vid test - which was also negative. 27th and 28th - dizziness better; still taking Zofran one time /day (for nausea); was able to go to work on 29th - still had some nausea but didn&#39;t have to lie down all day anymore - still had internal vibrations - feels like I should be having a tremor but can&#39;t see it externally; 30th finally able to see primary care Dr and she ordered lab work: Dr wasn&#39;t certain it was an adverse effect vs. me feeling my own immune response to spike protein; Initial covid symptoms in July were similar to this; and she will see how things go; SED Rate was 1 so not concerning; CBC was fine and B12 was fine. Not much as changed since then: returned to work; can go about things in every day; stopped taking Zofran on 31st; I still had nausea but it was mild enough that I didn&#39;t need to take it and Dr said it would be best to stop due to it&#39;s on effects. Yesterday, was first day with no nausea (1/4/2021); still have internal vibrations sensation but it has gone down quite a bit - now more of a mild buzzing electric current sensation - like insides are buzzing super fast ; when I noticed when not occupied with other things which is how it faded out with original illness.

                                                On 1/6 at approximately 9am hour, I noticed joint pain in my fingers while typing, muscle soreness in my upper back, a headache, and a slightly sore throat. It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.

She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

                                                Approximately 12 hours after receiving the booster dose, she awoke feeling extremely ill and nauseous, roused me to say so, and then immediately became unresponsive and pulseless. She was admitted to hospital for cardiac work up, and all diagnostic tests have found her heart to be normal in structure and function. Cardiology believes she experienced a vasovagal syncope with asystole. She remains hospitalized at this time for initiation of sotalol therapy; she was diagnosed with frequent PVCs approximately 1 year ago.

                                                My first dose of COVID vaccine I didn&#39;t have any symptoms (1st dose: 12/23/20). Received 2nd dose at 0800 on 1/12/21. First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

Then throughout the night symptoms worsened with significant body chills despite multiple layers, severe body pain and migraine trigger. In the morning felt like full-blown flu with fever of &gt; 100 F, sensitive skin painful to the touch, cold sweats, full body pains, heart palpitations (pounding heart beats and ave 100-120 bpm), and migraine level 8/10. Medication required to try to treat symptoms (metoclopramide, claritin, excedrin). Symptoms continued and did not start to lessen until approximately 30 hours post vaccine dose (18 hours post severe symptom initiation) and two doses of medication regimens. Arm around injection site also showed raised, red irritation local to the site, however, was not exacerbated throughout the symptom course. COVID call center recommended for me to see emergency care facility due to symptoms which I waited to see if symptoms worsened before deciding to not go to the urgent care center.

Symptoms were the same as they were after my first dose, so I&#39;m managing them at home with Benadryl, warm packs, soft food and liquids and continuing to monitor at home. No respiratory issues to note. I met with my PCP after my reaction to the first dose. He suspects lymphedema in response to the vaccine. I waited until all symptoms were clear to receive my second dose per my PCPs instructions.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                I received the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Wednesday, January 20th at 1:15 PM. After I got the vaccine, I went in to the observation tent for observation. I sat down and immediately felt a tingle sensation in my fingers on my left hand and my arm hurt at the injection site on my left arm. After I left the observation and returned home, the rest of the day/night, my left arm hurt where I received the shot, I had a headache, my neck hurt, and I felt a little nauseous. The next day, January 21st, I felt a slight tingle sensation in both my hands and feet on my left and right side. January 22nd, the slight tingle sensation in both hands and feet on my left and right side continued, and I had a very bad headache. The slight tingle sensation has continued along with some muscle soreness in my arms and legs. The tingle sensation is intermittent throughout the day in my fingers and toes. I have no numbness and it is not painful. It is just a slight minor tingle sensation. I messaged my doctor on January 25th and was advised to monitor it and contact back if it doesn&#39;t go away. Present day January 30th, I still have slight tingling sensation in my fingers and toes on my left and right side, the muscle soreness has since subsided.

This started 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. About 1 1/2 hours symptoms still persisted so took 50mg of Benadryl and slept for 2 hours. Upon waking up facial flushing, dizziness, and pounding heart rate still present but was better. Continued to have left sided cluster headache and face flushing for 48 hours. Also was sore in my left arm down my left side to the bottom of my rib cage all the way up my left neck and sore into my left chest.

She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

Then it progressed to a serve migraine, I was able to stay at work but went straight home after.  I started taking  Maxalt for my migraines and it didn&#39;t help any, I took this for two days. Mid day on the 31st I wasn&#39;t feeling to hot, laying around, couldn&#39;t shake the headache. The following day symptoms were the same but I was more ill, sick to my stomach, flu like symptoms I would say.  I had chills and night sweats during the evening , this went on for two evenings. Monday the physical effects went away but the headache was still there and concerned me because it was on my left said. I called my Neurologist and let her now my symptoms, she stated it was most likely from the vaccine. She was surprised my medication I was taking did not work but advised me to take Tylenol and it went away completely.  About a week and a day my head ace went away and I was ok.

                                                I received my vaccine at 1:10pm. As I was waiting afterwards, I started getting really itchy around 1:25pm. I have a lot of medicinal allergies and this is my normal response when I have a reaction. The itching gradually got worse and some swelling started as well. Around 1:45pm my throat started swelling and I was having trouble swallowing. This continued to get worse, so I stopped at the ER on my way home. I was given Benadryl in an IV and observed for 2 hours. The swelling in my throat went down by 2:45, but the itchiness continued until around 5pm. That evening, the only symptom left was fatigue.

This 36-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration on 20Jan2021 12:52 left arm at single dose (Lot: EL3247) for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing Anaphylaxis to Walnuts, Oranges, and morphine, ongoing allergy to a steroid cream Kenalog, and a steroid powder which she broke out immediately and ongoing Colitis. Concomitant therapy was none. She received the first dose of the vaccine yesterday on 20Jan2021 12:52 and 10 minutes later (20Jan2021 13:02) the tongue started swelling/Swollen tongue so they gave her Benadryl to try to stop it but it didn&#39;t help enough, hives started to appear on her body so they gave her a dose of epinephrine in the right arm and put on an IV, because she was feeling nauseous and dizzy. She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid. She went home and was taking Prednisone (1 daily), Benadryl and salbutamol (twice daily). She went into anaphylaxis within 15 minutes of receiving it on 20Jan2021. She brought 2 Epi injections with her. They monitored at the hospital for a few hours. She knows exactly how it happened. She was sitting in the observation room. She had told them multiple times that she had allergies before. She came in with two Epi pens and Benadryl. She let them know that as well. She was very verbal that she has history of anaphylaxis. They gave it to her. They said they were going to monitor her for 30 minutes. Her tongue started to swell 10 minutes after. She was sent to the paramedic tent. She took liquid children&#39;s Benadryl to try to stop the reaction. It did not help. She clarified it just didn&#39;t work enough to delay it. She doesn&#39;t have UPC, but provided the following information from the bottle: PLD-H242C LB004314 Lot WJ00896 Expiration Feb2023. She then started getting hives on her neck. She was hot, flush, and dizzy. She felt like she was going to throw up. That passed. They then gave her Epi in the opposite arm, her right arm. She got the COVID vaccine in her left arm. Then, they got her ready to go to the hospital. The transfer was smooth. She was waiting for intake when she started to not be able to swallow. She complained quickly. The nurses ran to get Epi, but the paramedic grabbed the patient&#39;s Epi pen and injected it in her thigh. She was IVed up at the vaccine center before transfer. They gave her Benadryl, Pepcid, and methyl prednisone. The Epi pen they gave her was her own shot. They monitored her a few hours. Then sent her home with Pepcid, more Epi pens, and Prednisone for 4 days. She has had normal soreness in her arm at the injection site. It has been status quo, it feels like a tetanus shot. She still has swelling in tongue, but they told her that might take a day or two to go away. She is supposed to also take Benadryl for the next 2 days. She was given the vaccine at the (Place name). Events visit to Emergency Room. They did a CBC and she was in normal range for everything. Lab data included on 20Jan2021: CBC normal. Outcome of the event Swollen tongue was recovering.  Outcome of the event Anaphylactic reaction/anaphylaxis was recovered.  Outcome of the event injection site soreness was not recovered. Outcome of the events was unknown.

I vomited a third time maybe an hour or so later. At 2:00 a.m. I got up again and vomited up bile, and then had quite a bit of diarrhea. I don&#39;t think it was something I ate within the past day or so because several other people ate the same meals and did not feel sick. It&#39;s now 11:00 a.m. the following day and I&#39;m taking it slow and drinking some water that I&#39;ve so far been able to keep down.

                                                Pt had nausea and vomiting and light headiness right after the vaccination.  pt wanted some water to sip.  Then it got worse.  Pt was pale and sweating. Her pulse was weak and hard to detect.  I put blood pressure monitor on her.  pt was uncomfortable.  Then I asked pt to lay down.  Short after, I measured pt&#39;s blood pressure was 125/80mmHg, pulse 75.  Pt started to feeling better.  Her 2nd blood pressure was 130/70mmHg and pulse 69.  Pt was ok to stand up later.  I had pt sitting outside of pharmacy and monitored by pharmacy assistant.  Pt left when she felt fine.  About 8pm, pt called to let us know she is fine and thanks us for the care we provided.  I called back to confirm.

The nurse reported similar events for herself and her daughter. This is the second of two cases.  A 36-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) via intramuscular route administered in arm  on 13Mar2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6208) as single dose (dose 1) and then via intramuscular route administered in arm on 03Apr2021 10:45 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as single dose (dose 2), for COVID-19 immunization. Patient has received both doses of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Medical history included Down&#39;s syndrome from 15Sep1984, morbid obesity and asthma since 2011 (Diagnosed 10 years ago), all were ongoing; and not a smoker/former smoker. Ongoing concomitant medications included loratadine (CLARITIN), paroxetine hydrochloride (PAXIL) and birth control. No prior Vaccinations (within 4 weeks). On 09Apr2021, the patient tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021. On the same day on 09Apr2021, the patient experienced hypoxia, fatigue, fluid in both lungs, loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well. The patient (who had Downs Syndrome not that it matters but it is a co-morbidity/ Daughter has downs) and the patient&#39;s mother (reporter) had their second doses on 03Apr2021 which was a Saturday and her daughter ended up in the hospital on Friday 09Apr2021 and tested positive for Covid. The patient was admitted with hypoxia. The patient&#39;s mother has questions for the timelines for their infections. She doesn&#39;t know if they were possibly infected before they got the second vaccine and were asymptomatic and unknown or did they get infected when got they got the vaccine thousands of other people. The patient&#39;s mother stated that it has mostly resolved now, and they were all home. It started with fatigue and loss of appetite and she wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she took her to the doctor at 08:00 and she was at the emergency room (ER) by 08:30 and hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The events required visit to Emergency Room and Physician&#39;s office. Treatment included Remdesivir, Steroid Injection and Oxygen. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Data Capture Aid included the following information: The patient had a positive test for SARS-CoV2. It was unknown if the patient had SARS-CoV2 antibodies at diagnosis. The patient was hospitalized from 09Apr2021 to 13Apr2021. The patient was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. The patient did not have SARS-CoV2 antibodies at hospital discharge. The patient displayed clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness including Oxygen Saturation on Admission was 83% on Room Air. The patient required supplemental oxygen (including high flow or ECMO). New or worsened symptoms/signs during the COVID-19 illness experienced (including date of onset/worsening) were Respiratory: Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs and Dyspnea. The patient received additional therapies for COVID-19 including 5 Doses of Remdesivir starting 09Apr2021 and ending 13Apr2021. The reporter stated that she thinks they gave her a steroid injection in the ER. The event did not require the initiation of new medication or other treatment or procedure. The patient&#39;s outcome with COVID-19 was recovering. Patient has not had a repeat test. The patient had numerous Lab work.  The patient was not a smoker/former smoker. The patient was taking medications routinely prior to the event being reported including Paxil, Claritin and Birth Control Pill. Pre-existing diseases worsened during the SARS-CoV2 infection including Asthma. The patient was not treated with immunomodulating or immunosuppressing medications or received any other vaccines around the time of COVID-19 vaccination. The patient underwent lab test and procedures including a Covid Test: Positive on 09Apr2021. The relatedness of drug to the events &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs&#34; was unknown (Source of assessment: Primary Source Reporter/ Method of assessment: Global Introspection). Causality was unknown because she doesn&#39;t know when they were exposed to the Covid. The reporter thinks the vaccine lessened their symptoms. Reporter seriousness for &#34;Tested Positive for Covid on 09Apr2021, after receiving her second dose of the Pfizer Covid Vaccine on 03Apr2021, Hypoxia, Fluid in Both Lungs (medically significant)&#34; was serious (hospitalization from 09Apr2021 to 13 Apr2021). Events Fatigue and Loss of Appetite were assessed as not serious by reporter. The outcome of the events Hypoxia, Fatigue, Fluid in Both Lungs, Loss of Appetite, she wasn&#39;t feeling well, COVID-19, dyspnea and Asthma aggravated was recovering and unknown outcome for the other event.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, vaccination failure of the suspected vaccine BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) cannot be completely excluded. Events hypoxia, pulmonary edema and dyspnea are attributed to Covid-19 infection and considered unrelated to BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE). The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021413231 same reporter and drug, similar event, different patient

Per my husband. My eyes rolled back in my head, my body went limp, and I was moaning. I did not come to for 30-60 seconds despite shaking, calling my name, and sticking his finger in my throat. I came to and was alert and oriented but have no recollection of the incident. EMS was called.

The headache continued and soon some fatigue and tiredness accompanied it for 7-10 days following vaccination.  Then ten days after, I had an increase in symtpoms that included heightened fatigue, loss of appetite, feeling &#34;cold&#34;/ &#34;hot&#34; (no fever), and abdominal pain with nausea and some diarrhea.    Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

Continuing to take Atarax every 6 hours per MD order.

                                                Symptoms reported by patient  Received vaccine on 1/4/2021 @ 0950.  Vaccine was given on side of left arm.  On the evening of 1/5 I started to not feel well.  I had a runny nose, headache, nausea, and fatigue.  The injection site on my left arm was red, warm, and swollen with a knot/ball that could be felt underneath.  I also had moderate pain at injection site.  This was about the size of a half dollar.  On the morning of 1/6 I still didn&#39;t feel well.  I received a call from my mom that she tested positive for COVID and although I did not have much contact with her there was one day on 12/26 that I saw her outside for about 15 minutes (masked).  I called employee health with all of this as it was hard to separate the exposure from symptoms of the vaccine.   I did express some concerns over having a vaccine reaction but was told the symptoms I was having would be normal.  I was tested for COVID, which was negative.  Over the next few days symptoms got better but I did have nausea on and off until the morning of 1/11.  Redness at injection site, swelling and pain were resolved by 1/11 as well.  On Friday 1/15 I woke up and my injection site was red, warm, swollen, and had pain again.  This was about the size of a quarter.  There was also a hard area that could be felt under the skin.  My arm hurt with radiating pain into my wrist.  I thought maybe it was just random and it would go away.  It slowly resolved through out the day and was mostly gone by Saturday 1/16/21.  The only thing left was a faded red area about the size of a nickel.  Friday evening ,1/15, I started to not feel well with body aches, joint pain, headache, and pain from injection site that radiated to my chest (this was intermittent).  I also had a low grade fever (highest temp 99.9).  I still did not feel well on Sunday but some symptoms were improved (pain radiating to chest was better and no more fever) but still had fatigue and body aches.  I had a rapid COVID test done which was negative on the evening of 1/17/21.  On 1/18 I felt better but towards the end of the day started to feel fatigued with body aches and headache.  I contacted employee health for further follow-up.

                                                lost consciousness; Severe cramping; diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12), Iron, and Vitamin D (VITAMIN D NOS); patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 14Jan2021 04:00 AM, the patient experienced severe cramping, followed by episode of diarrhea. During the cramping, she lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of lost consciousness cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

My flu-like symptoms resolved within 48 hours yet my breathing difficulties continued and worsened. I was treated in the Emergency Department on 1/12, 1/19 and 1/20 (work up negative for covid, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac abnormalities). It feels as though I am having intractable diaphragm spasms that are forcing my exhales out at the end of my breath cycle. I have lost 10lbs and have been essentially incapacitated for 6 weeks. I have been evaluated by head and neck (no vocal cord dysfunction), speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties), pulmonology (no lung specific issues) and am awaiting a neurology consult.

                                                I received my second dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on 01-13-2021 at 8:30am in my left upper arm.  By 3pm that day, my left arm was very tender to the point I couldn?t lift it up and I began having whole body chills and shivering along with extreme fatigue. I went to bed at 5:30pm that night and woke up around 11:30pm to my whole body shaking and shivering and my teeth where chattering together. My husband said I was confused at that time and kept repeating that I was freezing. I must have had 5 blankets piled on top of me to try to get me to warm up.  By the next morning, I soaked through the bedsheets and had extreme fatigue (like I had a hard time keeping my eyes open) all over body aches, fever and chills.  I remained this way for the next week.  At the end of the 1st week I still had chills, extreme fatigue, nausea and horrible headaches and my left arm pain turned into left elbow joint pain. By the end of the 2nd week, I still had extreme fatigue, headaches and left elbow pain along with body tremors. On 1-28-2021, I went to the hospital due to having two episodes where I felt so dizzy I had to lay down on the ground until the dizzy spells subsided. I was given IV fluids and sent home with orders to rest. By the end of the 3rd week I no longer had body tremors or dizzy spells but I still had extreme fatigue needing multiple naps a day along with headaches at which time my primary doctor prescribed me Imitrex to help alleviate the headaches and I still had left elbow joint pain. I also developed bronchitis. It is now February 25, 2021 and I am still having fatigue and mild to moderate headaches along with the left elbow joint pain along with some right elbow joint pain. I have been out of work for over a month now due to my fatigue and joint pain.

                                                Immediately after vaccine felt flushed with high heart rate and lightheaded. An hour after, developed chronic mild headache, chronic mild lightheadedness, and chronic moderate fatigue which are expected symptoms with the immune response. HOWEVER, symptoms did not improve in 3 days and actually very slowly worsened until I couldn?t function for work about 2.5 weeks after the vaccine. At this point, the lightheadedness and fatigue were severe and headaches varied between moderate to severe, resulting in me being out of work for 9 consecutive  work days. Had multiple MD visits with tons of tests. During the time I was out, I developed severe lower abdominal pain for two days and severe lightheadedness/nausea/mild vomitting due to being nauseated with chronic headaches. OTC meds did not help much for the headaches nor other symptoms. I have never dealt with symptoms like these before and am very healthy.  At the 4.5 week mark post vaccine, these symptoms finally started to very slowly improve, VERY slowly. Tests at MD were inconclusive. I?m still dealing with chronic mild headaches, lightheadedness, and this past Friday now unusual chest pains that move location and severity.

We were at a drive through clinic waiting the 15 minutes in the parking lot before leaving and had the paramedic from the ambulance come look. I leaned into the seat to let my husband photograph my dots, and where my shoulder was leaning into the seat, I immediately had a smattering of red pin prick dots. They began showing on my left arm. We were advised to go to the ER. My hemoglobin was fine (though clotting factors were off), and he?d see a few reactions like that, so we were sent home.   I had diarrhea, abdominal pain, and severe nausea, but nothing scary or bad.   I woke to not being able to urinate, and that was followed with complete incontinence. I cannot control my bladder at all, cannot urinate on demand, and often don?t realize I?m urinating until I feel the warm gush.

She was treated with Epinephrine x 3, Benadryl, steroids, famotidine. The outcome of the events was resolved with sequelae.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine can not be excluded for the reported events of short of breath, throat tight and swallow difficulty due to temporal relationship and current known drug safety profile.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I first got a bad headache and dizzy. They brought me back behind a curtain with an emergency person. I got very dizzy and nauseous after that. They had me lay down on a cot. About 30 minutes after I received the vaccine, they brought me out to my husband?s vehicle in a wheelchair. By that time, I was so dizzy that I could hardly stand by myself. I was told to call my primary care doctor. My husband called them while we were headed home. My tongue was swollen a little. We decided to go to my father in law?s home, since he is a doctor. By the time we got there, I was coughing. We were still on hold for a nurse at my primary care doctor?s office. I started getting hives on my chest and neck and wheezing around the same time. We left before seeing my father in law to go home and use my nebulizer. For the moment, I used my inhaler, which doesn?t work as well. Once we got to my driveway, a nurse from my PCP office said to go straight to the emergency room. I spent the night at the hospital that night and was treated for an allergic reaction, which resolved the issues. I continued medications at home after leaving the hospital the following day.

Then on 2/7/2021 I began feeling a pain in my right side. I initially brushed it off but the next morning I could barely move. Thinking it was appendicitis I went to the Emergency Department where I was diagnosed with a right-sided Ovarian Vein Thrombosis. This is a very rare blood clot of which I have no risk factors. I was referred to a Hematologist/Oncologist at a Medical Center.  I am currently on Eliquis until May 14th at which time I will be reevaluated by Dr.

A 38-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: ELO141), via an unspecified route of administration on 21Dec2020 at a single dose for covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergy. Concomitant medication included levosalbutamol hydrochloride (XOPENEX) for asthma and cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for allergy. About hour and a half to two hours after the vaccine, on 21Dec2020, the patient experienced had an allergic reaction with symptoms set of diarrhea, chills, palpitations, and tongue and throat swelling. The patient took diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) 25 mg as treatment. It helped some. She woke up this morning (22Dec2020) and still had the symptoms. So, she went to the emergency room. They gave her diphenhydramine 25 mg IV, methylprednisolone (SOLUMEDROL), and famotidine (PEPCID). The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood count and chemistry and lab work which showed normal on 22Dec2020. Outcome of the events was unknown. The patient thinks that the product had causality to the events.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The patient&#39;s medical history included asthma and allergy. Based on information available, the reported allergic reaction with symptoms set of diarrhea, chills, palpitations, and tongue and throat swelling was likely related to the use of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.

                                                I was 5.5 weeks pregnant when I revived the Pfizer Covid Vaccine. Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.  I cant help but think the vaccine in some way caused my body to reject the pregnancy.    Along  with the miscarriage, I also had extreme tiredness with GI upset 12/31/20 - 1/02/2021.

Husband got to me and laid on the floor.  Never passed out completely, but it was a very weird and odd feeling.  Felt better  after about 20 mins.  Have felt great since.  So did not go to primary care physician but felt the need to report.

I called my primary care physician to see if there was anything I could take to help, they advised me to take Ibuprofen and Tylenol. I started to feel better a few hours after taking Ibuprofen.  The next day I just had a headache and am feeling tired.  I would say the most extreme symptoms lasted about 10 hours and started to slowly feel better after that.

                                                Evening of 1-17-21 felt like I was having horrible vaginal infection symptoms. Saw a primary care physician on 1-18-21 and was found to have a raging yeast infection, bacterial vaginitis and urinary tract infection. I haven&#39;t had any of these in 15&#43; years. I was started on antibiotics. Next morning (1-19-21) felt extreme lower abdominal fullness and pressure and extreme nausea. I got in with my OBGYN at 9am same day and he discovered I had an ovarian cyst. He sent me down for an ultrasound and the results showed I had a ruptured ovarian cyst on my left side and an ovarian cyst on my right side. I have never had an ovarian cyst in my life. The next day (1-20-21) the right cyst ruptured. Having all three infections and two ovarian cysts (when I&#39;ve never had one before) lead my OBGYN and I to feel it warranted filing a VARES report

                                                12 hours after my first dose (1/19) I woke up with a high temperature, extreme body aches, sweating, headache and nausea.

I slept fairly well on Thursday evening. When I woke up on Friday morning, I had a pounding headache and my body ached. I was still sluggish and tired. Later that morning I also felt very nauseous. Pain relievers did not seem to help relieve any of my symptoms. I also had chills throughout the day. My arm and armpit hurt very bad throughout the day as well. Friday evening I did not sleep well. I was sweating and my body ached all over. Nothing seemed to provide relief. When I woke up on Saturday morning, I still had chills, body aches and a headache.  Pain relievers did seem to help. By about 2pm I started feeling better and like myself again.   Today is Monday and I do still have a sore arm and armpit. My armpit is swollen.

                                                I had terrible insomnia and the worst headache Wednesday night. When I finally went to sleep I tossed and turned and was cold and hot. I woke up with barely any strength. I slept from 8am-1:30pm Thursday. I had body aches, an upset stomach, muscle aches, and overall felt yucky. Friday I went to work for a presentation and was feeling awful. I had a fever and took some ibuprofen. My injection site was swollen and warm to the touch. I was dripping sweat last night Friday night. My lymph nodes are still swollen under my arm where I got the vaccine and my neck.

She didn&#39;t have an appetite (Jan2021), she only vomited when she ate. She had nausea and vomiting, it was about 2 o&#39;clock that afternoon (08Jan2021, 2 pm). Every time she ate, she vomited and lost taste, lost the sense of taste. The patient was still nauseated (Hence, ongoing checked for nausea) and she hadn&#39;t tasted anything. She hadn&#39;t drink or ate anything yet this morning but last night her taste was starting to come back. But she still couldn&#39;t identify something. No treatment received. Action taken for BNT162B2 was not applicable. Outcome of the event nausea was not resolved, outcome of the other events was unknown.

At 1:00am the next morning I started having chills and shaking which continued until 4am when I started having back cramps and arm cramps where I had my shot. I also felt feverish and had a very bad headache, so I took 600mg  of ibuprofen. I went in to work that morning and had chills and my skin hurt when my clothes touched my skin. I continued to have a headache also. I was sent home by my boss at 12pm on 1/5/21 because I looked and felt so bad and slept through the afternoon and for 10 hours that night. The next day, I continued to take 6oomg of ibuprofen every 6 hours and still had a lot of fatigue. The day after I was tired but them remained symptom free.

                                                Within 2 minutes of receiving vaccine, patient reported experiencing throat swelling, face and lip tingling. Patient was administered diphenhydramine PO while in clinic. At this time, patient declined to be seen in the ED and was released from clinic after additional monitoring. Patient received a course of prednisone from another physician later that day. 2 days later the patient began experiencing severe abdominal pain and was seen in the ED.  Labs, right upper quadrant ultrasound, and abdominal CT were within normal limits and was determined that symptoms were likely still part of COVID vaccine anaphylactic reaction. The patient was evaluated by the acute care surgery service who did not find anything concerning and was discharged home from the ED with return precautions and instructions to follow-up with primary physician. The patient follow-up with PCP and was continued on a 5 day course of steroids. The patient will not receive a second vaccine dose at this time and was referred to see an allergist for further testing.

She was given 50mg of diphenhydramine at 1332. At this time her pulse was 125, oxygen saturation 97%, unable to obtain BP due to small cuff size available. Med rec completed. Medical history taken, no contraindications to COVID-19 vaccine noted.  She was advised to lay down during this time and reported feeling a little better within 30 minutes of taking diphenhydramine, though noted onset of headache starting and mentions hx migraines. By 1409 her pulse was reduced to 98 bmp. 1434 C-O reported feeling a little lightheaded upon standing from laying, pulse 92 and oxygen saturation 98.

The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Started out slowly late morning around 9am and got worse by the afternoon.  Took Motrin to relieve symptoms and slept.  The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I turned bright red - my face and my forearms. Not a rash or raised rash. It was a deep red flushing. I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

Within 10 minutes of the vaccine she became ill dizziness nausea throwing up vertigo and it persisted for about a week heavily. The nurses were unequipped to handle possible side effects from the vaccine putting her in a corner and having her vomit in a box. They ignored her when suffering from obvious effect from the vaccine.  One nurse on our way out even told her to put on her mask as I dragged her out of terrible situation.She was unable to work drive or function somewhat normally for 4-5 days then it began to diminish. She is still having instances of vertigo and dizziness however much less.

Then, per patient: &#34;Almost 2 weeks to the day after getting my first shot, on Friday 2/26, I suddenly and unexpectedly went into Rapid Ventricular Response atrial fibrillation. I was admitted to the ER department at Northwestern. I was there 10 hours and multiple tests were completed. At this time, no causes have been found that would have contributed to my going into RVR A-fib.  I am wearing a heart monitor for 2 weeks and will undergo a stress echo exam on my heart.  I do not have a cardiac history.&#34;

A 39-year-old female patient (nurse) received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection; lot number: EL8982, expiration date was unknown, NDC number), via an unspecified route of administration at the age of 38 years on 18Jan2021 as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number and expiration date were not reported) on an unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Relevant medical history included acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) when she was 8 years old, but had been in remission since she was 13. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The pharmacy manager reported that the patient, who was one of her employees at the hospital, received her second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 18Jan2021 and on an unspecified date had experienced lymphadenopathy afterwards that was still ongoing. The reporter described it as &#34;very impressive swelling&#34; at the base of neck that got inflamed when the patient got hot or stressed out, causing impacts on her swallowing. The reporter stated that the patient had gone to the emergency room twice, where it had been described as angioedema on an unspecified date and had also seen an allergist, who described it as a &#34;robust immune response.&#34; The reporter was concerned about the ongoing nature of this lymphadenopathy and would like any information that would help to treat this. The reporter also stated that the patient had gone through &#34;medical procedures and computerized tomography (CT) scans&#34; with unknown results on an unspecified date and would like to know if the patient would be eligible for the Program because of the event. The patient was in the group that got the vaccine first. The patient still had impressive lymphadenopathy and it was persisting. At first it was interfering with the patient&#39;s swallowing, but it was still occasionally interfering with her swallowing. The reporter was wondering if there was any more in house data that had been reported on this. The reporter assessed the events as non-serious. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of angioedema, which included that the patient had been prescribed antihistamines, such as cetirizine (ZYRTEC), fexofenadine (ALLEGRA), hydroxyzine, famotidine (PEPCID), and methylprednisolone (MEDROL) dose packs. The patient was not recovered from the event &#34;lymphadenopathy,&#34; while the outcome of the rest of the events was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of angioedema, lymphadenopathy and other events  due to temporal relationship.   There is limited information provided in this report. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.

                                                I woke up with severe abdominal pain. Diagnosed as appendicitis. The surgeon noted that it was severely gangrenous upon removal.  Please note that while one of the causes can just be from hardened fecal matter, I do not have any issues with bowel movements, am regular, and have soft bowel movements.   I did become quite ill with headache, nausea, aches for two and a half days after the second vaccine, and that was my only known illness occurring before the appendicitis. As a virus can cause appendicitis, I wonder if my reaction to vaccine led to this as is was 18 days after the shot. While is was not an immediate event, I would imagine it can take time for an appendix to be affected to the point mine was before it became acute.

The patient developed a headache, blurred vision and severe dizziness such that he couldn&#39;t stand without assistance. Patient also felt a band of numbness and tightness in his right arm that migrated down his arm from the site of the vaccination all the way to his wrist. The site of injection also became very sore. There was no treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.

                                                Her fever is 103; Vomiting; Nauseated; This is a spontaneous report recieved from a contactable consumer (husband) reported for a 38-year-old female wife(patient) reported that she received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 07Apr2021 10:30 (Batch/Lot Number: ER8737) as SINGLE DOSE for covid-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. On 07Apr2021 15:30, the patient experienced her fever is 103, nauseated and vomiting. Caller was reporting on behalf of his wife. They both just got the Covid-19 Vaccine earlier today at around 10:30. Right now it was 16:00. It seems like his wife was experiencing some side effects, and he wanted to call to confirm and report it. She was nauseated and unwell. She has a fever, and he took her temperature several times just now. She vomited as well. She became nauseated about one hour ago. It got worse and is causing her to throw up. She threw up 3 different times in the last 30 to 40 minutes. Her fever was 103. He asks if that temperature was considered an emergency. It seemed fever as a common thing on the list about the risks, but he doesn&#39;t know about 103. Referred caller to his wife&#39;s physician for medical advice. The outcome of the events was reported as not recovered.  No follow-up attempts are needed. No further information is expected.

                                                I received the COVID vaccine on Monday Dec. 21, 2020 at 14:30.  By 17:00 I was not feeling well.  I was tired, had a headache, muscle aches, nausea and a fever of 101 F.   The headache, low grade fever and significant malaise continued through Tues Dec 22 and Wed Dec 23.   On Thursday morning Dec 24 at 2:30 AM, I woke from sleep with the urge to use the bathroom.   I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy and had a diaphoresis that soaked my hair and PJs.   Fortunately my husband who is a nurse anesthetist helped me through the episode safely and was able to get me back to bed.   I am not sure if that event was related to the vaccine or if I happened to be a little dehydrated and had a vaso-vagal event.  I did not take any medications because I was allowing my body to have a natural response to the vaccine.

Also had extreme dizziness, nausea, headache 2 days after injection.  Dizziness, nausea, headache subsided after 24hrs however injection site reaction will go away and come back randomly.  Seems to coincide with getting sick?  Was fine up until 12/29 when I did end up getting sick to include headache, body aches, chills.  I went to go get covid tested which was negative.  I ultimately had a sinus/ear infection.  However injection site reaction had gone away UNTIL I got sick on 12/29 then it showed up again and still have it as of today.

I vomited about 6 times that day and had diarrhea. Next morning, my face was flushed. I had a low grade fever of 99.5, and checked my BP. On my home machine, my pulse was 135. I decided to go to the hospital. My Apple Watch measured my heart rate to be 150 at one time. At the ER, I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and dehydration. I was placed on oxygen as my levels were between 90-93, and I was given IV fluids. I have felt fatigued since then, some nausea, and mild diarrhea still.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                I started to feel fatigued and slightly dizzy at 12:30 pm the day I received the shot which would have been about 5 hours after. I also had a low grade fever of 99.2 and arm pain at the injection site. That evening I began to have chills and fever, fatigue, body aches, and nausea. These symptoms lasted until the evening of 1/15/2021. Fever was on and off during that time and ranged from 99.2-100.7.  My arm was very sore during this time and on 1/16/2021 it became very itchy and hot at the injection site so I took Zytrec which helped some with the itching  and was like it this for about 24 hours then subsided.  I did not go to the doctor because my symptoms were not severe and I recovered at home.

                                                I had very slight nausea soon after the first shot, then started having chills and whole body ache from the night (12/18/2020) for 24 hours followed by spontaneous internal hemorrhage (lower GI, significant blood in stool) in the morning  and in the afternoon of 12/20/2020.  The hemorrhage lasted for about 24 hours.  It started slowing down on 12/21/2020, then stopped.    I was evaluated by Dr., (GI) who was not sure if the bleeding was vaccine induced vs. coincidence on 12/23/2021.  Since the bleeding stopped, she cleared me for the 2nd vaccine and advised me for close monitoring for any other episode of bleeding.  I had some fatigue for about 4-5 days since the first shot, then I felt normalized.    Soon after the 2nd vaccine (in about 5-10mins) on 1/8/2021, I started having some discomfort/pain in lower rib region where spleen is.  Initially I felt like some chest pain, but it was more near spleen region, I think... I also had slight intermittent dizziness for about 2 hours after the 2nd injection.  The discomfort in left lower chest/rib improved and resolved in an hour or so.    Then, similar pattern started including chills and whole body ache on the night of 1/8/2021 followed by internal hemorrhage again (significant blood in stool) in the morning and in the afternoon of 1/9/2021.  The bleeding slowed down on 1/10/2021, then stopped.   I reported it to again my GI doctor on 1/11/2021 who ordered CBC to monitor my platelet level.  The result showed down trending from my baseline.    I think the COVID vaccine transiently affected me with internal hemorrhage and lowering platelets/likely potential thrombocytopenia given the clinical symptoms (spontaneous internal hemorrhage).   Platelet level is improving at this time and I feel normalized today.

I had onset of fever, chills and body aches starting a 230 pm day after vaccine. My baby started having fever 2 hours later. I direct fed him about one hour and a half after receiving the vaccine. He had fever Max of 101.7 and has continued to have after 72hours. He had change in the stool consistency and smell  but not diarrhea. He had decrease intake today but otherwise asymptomatic. I?m a pediatrician. His physician exam is normal except for tiny lymph nodes palpable in his axila and inguinal área. Today I checked his urine dip and was negative. No other testing has been completed. Fever has been control easily with Tylenol and the last 2 doses I have chosen to give Motrin. Baby is well appearing, active and playful otherwise. No history of contacts. We have no social contact with anybody for months, no grocery shopping, use N95 when seeing patients but I?m mostly Telehealth. My 5 yo is virtual student and does not have any symptoms. My husband has received first dose Covid and is also asymptomatic. I don?t have any reason to think there is any other etiology rather than my vaccine administration. My symptoms resolved after 30hours. I only had mild arm pain with first dose and baby was completely asymptomatic

                                                The day of the shot about an hour and half I started feeling achy pain in my knee to my toes and my leg went numb. I had a headache and felt confused, I couldn&#39;t remember what to do. The site was sore, I was dizzy, nausea and tired.  This lasted for about 2-3 days .I took the next day off.  The Dr. at my work said it should go away.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

Under my nose was numb, felt like I had novacaine. 1 hour and 30 minutes later my throat swelled. I had a hard time getting water down my throat. I took two benadryl pills at 11:10 am. Throat swelling went away within 10 minutes of taking benadryl and I was able to eat without any issues. My lips are still tingling, it&#39;s been 7 hours since the injection.

My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.

Because of being exposed to my charge nurse I had to go get tested. By 9AM body aches, headache, cough, chills.  Fever went down on Thursday 100.8F, hot and cold sweats. I never felt like that before.  I also had some GI issues (diarrhea) and a little bit of shortness of breath, just by walking to the restroom I would be very fatigued and when I checked my oxygen it would drop to 88% just by walking from my bed to the bathroom (Wednesday and Thursday was the worst). I still have fatigue and my throat hurts a little bit, I have congestion again and I started feverish again this Tuesday and lots of cough. Low grade fever (99.9F). My employee health told me to not return due to my symptoms until they subside or go get checked. Coughing and sneezing restarted yesterday. I had returned to work on Monday but then by Tuesday symptoms started reappearing.

                                                10 hrs after I received 1st dose of Pfizer I started feeling my heart beating rapidly and hard.  I was short of breath and had nausea and a headache.  This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

That night I went to drink and liquid came out my mouth spontaneously,  my left side of face had lost normal wrinkles on forehead, eyebrow wouldn&#39;t lift, eyelid wouldn&#39;t blink, cheek couldn&#39;t puff, lips didn&#39;t smile. Next day (1) slight cheek numbness noted- resolved Day3 . Day 2 slight difficulty articulating words. Night 3 intermittent sharp outer ear and mastoid area pain duration 30min and at different times intermittent pulsatile heartbeat and whistling sound 10 min or less.  Day 4 &amp; 6 notable improvements in cheek ability to puff- not fully resolved though. Day 5 eyelid movement - not fully resolved though.  Day 6: less difficulty articulating. Day 1: Spoke to OB office nurse- offered steroids which I declined &amp; spoke to PCP recommended go to ED, which I declined, I&#39;m a family physician and had otherwise normal Cranial nerve testing and no other neurological changes- seems fully consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy.  Day 3 had co-worker physician use otoscope - normal exam bilaterally.

The onset of delirium came with the temp as we were on a road trip in the car headed to a hockey tournament.  It was noticed by my spouse who is a physician and several other hockey parents. I looked up delirium as a side effect but could not find anything related with the exception of elderly or with COVID itself.  So I thought I should report it to see if it had been reported by anyone else. It lasted until I went to bed and fever came down that night.

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, Lot number EN5318), via an unspecified route of administration on 26Jan2021 at 14:45 (at the age of 39 years) as a single dose in the right arm for COVID-19 vaccination. Medical history included  fatty liver. The patient had no known allergies. Prior to the vaccination, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 on an unspecified date.  Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported that on 27Jan2021 at 12:30 AM, approximately ten hours after the vaccine, the patient experienced a rapid and hard heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea and headache. These lasted for one and one half hours. As she lay down falling asleep she got a strange vision/hallucination (this had never happened to her before) of her eyes turning lightning blue and her body rising up in the bed. She stated that she does not take medications or drugs and does not have a history of mental illness. She could not shake the vision. She fell asleep and had nightmares all night and nightmares are rare for her.  One day two she woke up fine just a stiff, sore arm. On day three her arm has a bumpy, red mild rash at and around injection site. The patient did not receive any treatment for the events. Lab data included a COVID SARS CoV-2 positive test on an unspecified date. The clinical outcomes of hallucination, heart rate increased, shortness of breath, nausea, headache, nightmares, pain in arm, limb stiffness and vaccination site rash were reported as recovering. It was also reported that since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19.

                                                Symptoms consistent with flare of Ulcerative Colitis: defecation urgency, blood in stool, loose stools.  I notified my GI doctor about symptoms, we agreed to increase my dose of Balsalazide to 3 grams PO BID.   Symptoms had not resolved prior to my receiving second dose of vaccine.  I had not had a flare in 2 years, and had a colonoscopy 6 months prior which showed complete resolution  including normal biopsies.  I continue to have symptoms 2 months later, I&#39;m scheduled for follow up with GI in March. I realize this may just be correlation and not causation but felt it was important to report in case they are related.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

                                                Something stuck in my throat; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EJ1685; Expiration date was not reported) on 22Dec2020 (12:30) at a single dose on the left deltoid, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included allergy to lobster, and had used steroids. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 24Dec2020, the patient had something stuck in the throat; and had nausea. The patient had an emergency room visit due to the reported events; and had received a three-day course of oral prednisone and antihistamine, and then diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). The patient had no respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestations. The outcome of the events, &#39;something stuck in the throat&#39; and &#39;nausea&#39;, was recovered on an unspecified date. The reporter had considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the suspect vaccine.

I had to call off work for the following 2 days as I barely ate or slept during that time. Seventy-two hrs post vaccination, I was able to return to work with only one remaining side effect: lingering stomach cramps.  Self treated with alternating doses of OTC Extra-strength Tylenol and Excedrin Migraine while I was experiencing migraine, fever, myalgia and joint pain. Also took Ultra-strength Rolaids as needed for bloating and stomach cramps.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included treatment with Procardia 10 mg, every 6 hrs, by mouth; Betamethasone steroid injections. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The maternal exposure during pregnancy and associated events of contractions and abdominal pain were possibly related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  However, contractions and abdominal pain were very common events. The patient experienced contractions and abdominal pain starting three days after receiving second dose of vaccine, therefore, there maybe other factors which may have impacted the occurrence of the events.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available. This impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of  the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

The front half of her tongue was swollen and stinging; had white dots and a sore tip on the tongue; Sinus Pressure; Body Aches; Tired; Dizzy; Nausea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable licensed practical nurse (LPN) reporting on behalf of physician. A 39-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine, via an unspecified route of administration on 09Mar2021, at 39 years of age, (Batch/Lot Number: EN6206) as single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no medical history; concomitant medications were not reported. On 09Mar2021, a few minutes after receiving the vaccine, the patient felt sinus pressure that lasted the rest of the day, she was tired and dizzy for two days and also had nausea for two days and body aches for the first 3 days, all assessed as non-serious. Then the patient stated that when she woke up on 11Mar2021, her tongue was swollen and had white dots and a sore tip on the tongue. The front half of her tongue was swollen and stinging. The patient stated she did not feel as if though her throat was swollen, just her tongue, but it resolved after 3 days. These events were assessed as medically significant and the tongue swelling was what the reporter was mainly concerned about. There were no treatments, no medication was given, the patient was not seen in the Emergency Department, she was not hospitalized and was not admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. She visited the Physician Office on 15Mar2021 and Physician Assistant advised the patient not to get the second COVID vaccine. The event &#34;sinus pressure&#34; resolved on 09Mar2021, the events &#34;Tired&#34;, &#34;Dizzy&#34; and &#34;Nausea&#34; resolved on 11Mar2021, the event &#34;body aches&#34; resolved on 12Mar2021, the events &#34;tongue was swollen and had white dots and a sore tip on the tongue; the front half of her tongue was swollen and stinging&#34; resolved on 14Mar2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information available, a causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported serious events cannot be excluded.

                                                The first abnormal effect I experienced was numbness in my inner upper lip. This was intermittent and lasted roughly 24-48 hours after vaccine administration. Then on 3/25, I had muscle cramping/soreness in my lower leg muscles (calves). The next day (3/26), the muscle soreness continued, and my lower leg muscles began to feel tight when walking. On 3/27, I woke up with numbness and tingling in my right 5th digit, which then spread to all my fingers and toes.  That morning, the muscle soreness had also spread into my thighs and bilateral upper extremities. I also noted mild swelling in my hands and feet and could not put my rings on or wear socks or shoes. By that evening, walking became more difficult as the muscle soreness had now turned into muscle weakness. This prompted me to go the ER for evaluation. A CT scan of my head and lab work was done. I was given IV fluids and sent home with instructions to return to the ER the following day for a MRI of my brain. Overnight, the weakness and swelling in my hands and feet progressed . I became unable to walk, go to the bathroom, or feed my self without assistance. The numbness and tingling I first experienced in my inner upper lip returned, and these symptoms were also now noted in the rest of my face as well. I also began having muscle soreness in my neck, my jaw felt sore when chewing food, and I began seeing some floaters. I returned to the ER the morning of 3/28.  They did more blood work, imaging, as well as a lumbar puncture, and I was admitted to hospital. Once admitted, the hospitalist consulted with another hospital and recommended transfer by EMS there where I was admitted under a neurologist&#39;s care. When I arrived at that hospital, I began to feel somewhat better as the soreness and swelling appeared to be improving, and I could walk without assistance. They did a full neurological workup and kept me overnight for observation. Overnight, I did experience a mild headache that was relieved with Tylenol and rest.  I woke up the next morning  (3/29) with nausea and did have a few episodes of vomiting that turned into dry heaving and was given Zofran with relief. The swelling in my hand went down enough that I was able to make a fist and grasp objects with my fingers again. After the neurologist reviewed my labs and work up the morning of 3/29, I was allowed to return home to await final test results as all my tests were looking normal, my symptoms were continuing to improve, and PT had cleared me to be able to return home. Upon discharge, I was instructed  to not get my 2nd COVID vaccination as it was possible that my symptoms were an adverse reaction to the COVID vaccination as no  other diagnosis was found with testing. I was instructed to follow up with my PCP in one week. Since returning home, I have continued to be very easily fatigued and have had some headaches, nausea, and dizziness. I continue to feel weak when walking and have some muscle stiffness when first waking from sleep. I also continue to have some intermittent episodes of numbness and tingling.
