Did not say anything and sat there for the 15 minutes with continued shortness of breath and high rate think it was anxiety. When the time was up I continued to stay at the hospital for an hour due to fear of bad reaction. Started to become extremely nauseous within 30 minutes and loss of appetite. Went to bed and woke up with a terrible headache, body aches, extreme fatigue and a 100.3 degree fever. Slept for 8 hours during the day waking up due to the pain in my body and chills but the symptoms went away by 5 pm the following day of the shot.

This 26-year-old female patient (pregnant: no) received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EL3248), intramuscular on 08Jan2021 at 07:45 AM at single dose on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included anxiety and depression. No known allergies. Concomitant medication included fluoxetine hydrochloride (PROZAC), bupropion hydrochloride (WELLBUTRIN), diphenhydramine hydrochloride (ZZZQUIL). No other-vaccine-in-four weeks. The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE, lot number: EK5730), intramuscular on 22Dec2020 at 08:00 PM on right arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced tachycardia up to 150 resting, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, migraine, body aches, chills and fever up to 102. Symptom onset around 7PM on 08Jan2021 and stopped around 12PM 09Jan2021 except for headache which was still persisting as of 9PM 09Jan2021. No treatment was received for the events. The outcome of headache was not recovered. The outcome of other events was recovered on 09Jan2021 at 12PM. The patient did not have COVID-prior-vaccination. The patient did not have COVID tested post vaccination.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported tachycardia was probably related to the use of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE) due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.

Headache and body aches have worsened in severity. Unable to work for the morning but was able to go in the afternoon for a short time period. Lower body aches are particularly severe. Fatigue is noticeable. Mental health conditions have worsened but that may be due to lack of sleep.  30 hours following the vaccine: chills, nausea, and dizziness have dissipated completely. They were slowly improving throughout the day.

For about 36 hours, it ran 100-130&#39;s; Dehydration; Feeling fatigued/Excessive fatigue; Had some general arm soreness; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient).  A 26-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Solution for injection, Lot number: EJ 1686, unknown expiration), intramuscular in right arm on 08Jan2021 at 13:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital.  The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; Lot number: EJ 1685, unknown expiration) via intramuscular in right arm on 22Dec2020 at 12:30 PM for COVID-19 immunization in a hospital. Concomitant medications included ibuprofen (MOTRIN) as needed and unspecified birth control. The patient has no known allergies. The patient started feeling fatigued about 1900 hours (07:00 PM) on 08Jan2021 and only had some general arm soreness. She woke up on 09Jan2021, with serious chills to the point of physical shaking; nausea started soon after and around 0300, began vomiting and dry heaving. The patient also experienced significant body aches, especially pronounced in lower back region occurred. Headache also present at this time (09Jan2021). She began having sweats and possible fever (didn&#39;t have thermometer to accurately verify this though). The patient&#39;s average HR is usually 70s. For about 36 hours (09Jan2021), it ran 100-130s. Vomiting episodes continued and for all of 09Jan2021, the patient did absolutely nothing. The patient described her body ached like it had been beaten by a baseball bat. On 10Jan2021, her HR at rest back in 70s, but with minimal exertion, will go to 110-120s. She had to call out of work from 11Jan2021 and 12Jan2021 due to continued nausea, dehydration and excessive fatigue. The patient did not receive other vaccine in four weeks.  The patient did not have COVID prior to vaccination and was not tested for COVID post vaccination. The patient&#39;s symptoms still persisting at the time she is reporting this event. The patient did not receive treatment for the events. The outcome of the event &#34;having sweats&#34; was unknown, while the patient is recovering for the remaining events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The reported serious chill was likely related to the BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) due to plausible temporal relationship and known safety profile of this product.

Patient evaluate 2 L of fluid given her Mirena IUD D-dimer was sent which was negative patient with no pleuritic symptoms or dyspnea to suggest pulmonary embolism. Otherwise hemodynamically stable on exam ambulates with no difficulty no focal neurologic deficits. Patient did describe on her initial presentation that she noted some weakness of her bilateral legs. Given her possible viral reaction and description of weakness it is possible the patient is developing an early autoimmune reaction however she has no evidence of GuillainBarré or transverse myelitis on my exam. We will plan to discharge with neurology follow-up as outpatient.

                                                Approximately 24 hours after receiving dose 1 of the Pfizer vaccine, I began having chills and vomited. My fatigue became more severe as well. Later that evening my fatigue persisted and I noticed a rapid heart rate via my Watch. My resting heart rate which usually is about 80 BPM was at 100 while laying down and not engaged in any physical activity. When I stood I was dizzy and had poor balance. While my entire arm no longer hurt, the injection site showed a bump as well. When I awoke the next day my heart rate appeared normal again, and I wasn&#39;t especially fatigued compared to before I got the vaccine. I did experience another minor gastro-intestinal episode later that afternoon, but otherwise my symptoms appeared to have passed aside from the fatigue. By the end of my work day I was very tired again, although it is uncertain if this is due to the vaccine or from my continued recovery from Covid and adjusting to the physical demands of going back to my job in-person. Because I received my vaccine on the same day as my first day back to work, I have no experience working post-covid before having the vaccine to compare my current state of fatigue to. On the evening of 01/07 I noted that fatigue was slightly less pronounced. I do not currently have a primary care doctor but will be calling to try to gain an appointment so that my second dose can be monitored.

                                                Got 1st shot at 1430 1/4/21. Was sent back to my unit (OR). At 1455 got full body flush followed by tingling lips, tight throat, trouble swallowing and SOB. No obvious signs of swelling of the lips. Used inhaler for SOB which helped marginally. After 1.5 hrs tingling in lips and flushed skin went away. Throat tightness and SOB still remained but weren&#39;t progressing so went home after my shift. Later that night around 2100 took 1 25mg  Benadryl. Tightness in throat and SOB improved. The next morning 1/5/21, I reported to work for my shift. Tightness and SOB was manageable at this point. At 0800 the tightness in my throat, trouble swallowing and SOB got significantly worse. I was scrubbed into a surgery and had to call for a replacement so I could take Benadryl. I took 1 25mg tablet and 2 puffs of my inhaler and went back to my case. After the Benadryl and inhaler, the tightness in my throat and SOB became slightly more manageable. At 1240 the symptoms came back and I took another Benadryl and 2 puffs of my inhaler with slight relief of symptoms. Stayed the rest of my shift continuing my inhaler as needed and a Benadryl every 4 hrs. At 1600 I developed a headache at the front of my head above my eyes like a weight was sitting there. The next day when I woke up 1/6/21, the tightness in my throat, SOB and headache were worse so I had to call into work. The headache that morning had progressed to 7 out of 10 pain and the pain then included my neck where it attaches to the skull. At 0830 I called employee health and they advised my to go to an urgent care. I was checked over by a PA and was prescribed prednisone 40 mg for 5 days along with Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler as needed. I was also nasal swabbed for Covid. After taking the steroid, the headache and neck pain, tightness in throat went away. The SOB also improved. Currently taking the steroid, Benadryl (every 4 hrs) and inhaler 2 puffs as needed. Symptoms are mostly controlled. 1/7/21 tried to cut back the Benadryl to every 6 hrs. Noticed a huge difference in my breathing and had an increase in SOB so went back to every 4 hrs. 1/8/21 still taking steroid and Benadryl every 4 hrs and inhaler. SOB is worse today even with taking Benadryl. Have an appointment with my PCP to talk about getting the 2nd shot.

It wasa very scary experience for me. This lasted about 15 or 20 minutes I&#39;m guessing (hard to say for sure because I was too worked up to watch the clock) but I ended up making myself fall back asleep. The next day January 8th I had diarrhea multiple times in theafternoon and felt strange, somewhat lightheaded and some what felt like anxiety.

I felt really dizzy and nauseated, I felt like I could not walk. I felt like I hit by a bus. The next day I had heavy flu symptoms, high fever, continuous chest pain and high HR, at the ER they gave me a high dose of Benadryl, steroids and fluids. I took Benadryl for about 7 days and I still felt light headed palpitations and fever for almost 2 weeks. I also was tested for COVID and it was negative. I was advised to not take the second vaccine. I still have a really bad fatigue. It is the symptom that is still on and off.

I had a hard time staying awake, started to become flushed and feeling feverish at 0700 at work, and began to develop a headache and nausea around 0745. I went to sick call on my ship after realizing I couldn&#39;t power through the symptoms around 0800, and my Senior Chief  mentioned earlier in the report) sent me home with motrin, tylenol, and mucinex for any congestion that may come up. Today (14JAN21) I seem to be a little more active and have an easier time staying awake, the headache and nausea have dissipated completely. However, I am still feeling more fatigued than I have been lately, and I began to feel flushed and feverish again around the same time in the morning.

While in the medical observation area I tried to take a sip of water but could not swallow it. At that moment I began having a tight feeling in my chest. I began to hyperventilate followed by difficulty breathing or talking. This was accompanied by feelings of impending doom, and uncontrollable trembling and inability to concentrate on what the medical observation area Doctor was saying. The time from the drink of water until I was able to breathe, speak, and concentrate normally was about 20 minutes. Tightness in my chest has improved but not fully recovered. General malaise and headache have developed.

                                                Mild headache about 6 hours after then by about 12 hours after dose had profound chills, body aches, severe nausea and temperature 99.8 F. I treated the nausea with Zofran with some improvement in nausea, but other symptoms continued. My max temperature (without antipyretic affecting) was 100.7 F with continued nausea, body aches, fatigue and headache until the 24 hour after vaccine time frame. After 24 hours, nausea had improved largely to just mild, mild headache continued and fatigue/body aches. Around 28 hours, temp was 100.2 F (outside of last antipyretic dose) with same symptoms. Now around 30 hours out with recent Motrin taken, my nausea is still mild, low appetite, improved body aches and less fatigue. I have not had any site reactions other than pain starting around 6 hours after injection.  Course to come yet unknown.

Called off work from my job as a flight nurse at midnight. Tried to sleep it off until about 0430 when the body aches became unbearable. Ate a few bites of yogurt and took 400mg of ibuprofen. No change in symptoms until 0530 when I took a hot shower which helped relieve some muscle pain. Took 400mg ibuprofen again at 1030 with a small snack with no change in pain or fevers. Took hot shower again which helped briefly. Nausea subsided around 1630, enough that I had a small meal of bland food and another 400mg of ibuprofen. By 1700 more tolerable myalgias and fever came down some. 2230 another 400mg dose of ibuprofen, fitful night of sleep waking again at 4am with shooting lower back pain and fever. Took another dose of 400mg ibuprofen and a hot shower. Woke up at 1000am sweaty with mild myalgias and low grade fever. Took another dose of ibuprofen 400mg, 30 minutes later profusely sweaty but afebrile. Fatigued all day and poor appetite until late evening. Woke up next day after better night of sleep at 0730. Mild fatigue and bad heartburn all day and night. Left arm still sore to touch. This morning (1/11) feeling mild heartburn but better.

                                                Symptoms: Fainting, Unconciouness (repeatedly), Profusive Sweating, Low Blood Pressure (60 over unknown number), Nausea, Dizziness, Unable to stabilize quickly, not able to get an IV, extreme thirst  Signs: Immediately felt unwell within 5 minutes of the vaccine.  Time Course: Injection (1st dose - Pfizer) at 4:00pm. Adverse Reaction at 4:05/4:10 (est.) Released at 5:00pm (est.)  Description of Incident:  On March 8th, at 4:00 pm, I received my first dose of the covid vaccine. Within 5 to 7 minutes, I felt unwell while sitting in the waiting area. I walked towards a worker to inform them that I was feeling unwell and that I was going to pass out. I became unresponsive and laid on the ground. My husband was with me at the time. I was unconscious for a bit and when I regained consciousness, my legs were being raised. I regained consciousness and was able to recall my name, DOB, and address. After I was done recalling my information, I began to lose consciousness again. They brought a wheelchair and took me to the medical room. As I moved from the wheelchair to the bed, I began to lose consciousness again. They told me to lay down. I overheard a woman ask my husband if I had diabetes or heart problems. He answered ?No.?. She explained to him that my body did not know how to accept the vaccine and was trying to regulate back to normal. She explained that my body was going through ?homeostasis? (?). While I laid on the bed, some workers took my blood pressure and tried to start an IV. One of them made a comment and said I was extremely dehydrated. This was odd to hear because I normally drink 3 to 4 liters of water daily. During this entire medical event, I felt the water pushing out through my pores. I was drenched in sweat. He tried to start an IV on my left arm and was unsuccessful. He tried to start an IV on my right hand, which was also unsuccessful. He stated they were unable to start IV liquids because my veins kept popping/collapsing. My blood pressure was reading 60. They checked it again, still at 60. I laid in the bed and basically waited it out. After a few minutes, they checked my blood pressure at it was at 120. They said that was good and I was good to go. No report was given to me nor my husband about the event that occurred. Even after they agreed to let me use a wheelchair (due to feeling weak), one was not provided to me. They basically stated that I was ?good to go?, after doing a series of hand squeezes and walking a few steps upright. I am currently trying to obtain a copy of the report I saw the gentleman fill out at the time. I was given Zofran to help with my nausea, it was placed under my tongue. After going home, I felt weak, tired and somewhat lightheaded. My husband drove me home and I got some rest. I set an appointment with my doctor on Friday March 12th to determine what happened to me during my vaccine and to record the incident. After describing the incident, she determined that it was anaphylaxis. She recommended for me not to get my second dose due to the anaphylactic shock I experienced with the first dose. She was shocked to learn that they did not transport me to the hospital or provided an Epi Pen injection.  When asked why I didn?t drive myself to the hospital, I let her know that they told me I was ?good?. They did not explain what had occurred to me, no mention of anaphylaxis was explained. I was not aware that is what had occurred. The incident occurred from 4:00pm (injection time) to 5:00pm (left location).

This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improve; brain fog; retroorbital headache/intermittent mild tension type frontal headache; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient).  A 29-year-old female patient received first dose BNT162B2 (lot number EH9899), via an unspecified route of administration on 17Dec2020 12:00 at 29 years old at single dose at Left arm for COVID-19 immunization.  Medical history included Mirena IUD, personal and family history of retinal migraines (without headache). The concomitant medications were magnesium citrate, melatonin, ademetionine (SAME) and fish oil. On 18Dec2020 in the AM, developed progressive severe soreness at injection site, worse than any other vaccine, hurt even just the touch. This lasted about a total of 36 hours and progressively improved. There was no swelling, redness, or other local symptoms. In the afternoon on 18Dec2020, she developed significant loss of mental clarity (brain fog) while at work. In the evening on 18Dec2020, developed mild retroorbital headache (this was actually the first headache of my life). All day 19Dec2020 and about half the day of 20Dec2020 developed a migraine (also the first of my life), experienced as retroorbital pounding headache, sensitivity to light and sound in 19Dec2020, nausea without vomiting in 19Dec2020, and loss of mental clarity. She had intermittent mild tension type frontal headache on 20Dec2020 PM with all other symptoms resolved, all symptoms resolved by 21Dec2020 AM. The patient used naproxen 440 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg on 19Dec2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient has not been tested for COVID-19. The patient was not Allergic to medications, food, or other products. The outcome of the events was recovered on 21Dec2020.  The information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on information available, the reported loss of mental clarity together with other events was likely related to the first dose BNT162B2 due to temporal relationship and clinical course.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                29-year-old previously healthy female presenting today with difficulty sleeping, sore throat, and nausea after receiving the second Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 10 AM.  Patient says that after her first dose of the vaccine she had mild sore throat and hoarse voice that resolved spontaneously.  She had her vaccine around 10, several hours later before coming to the emergency department between 2--230 she had the sudden onset of difficulty speaking with associated sore throat and nausea.  She has had dry heaving but no large amounts of vomiting.  She has not had stridor, wheezing, shortness of breath, syncope, or the development of a rash or hives.  She has not had a reaction to her prior vaccines she does not have any other allergies in general.  She has otherwise been well recently without infectious symptoms including fevers, chills, cough, and has not been exposed to Covid to her knowledge. Medications administered in ED included diphenhydramine 50 mg IV once, dexamethasone 10 mg IV once, famotidine 40 mg IV once, ondansetron 4 mg IV once. Had brief episode of shaking and R arm rigidity in the ED. Patient denies LOC during the episode, did not have a post ictal state, no tongue biting or episodes of incontinence.

                                                1/8/21 - 15 minutes after second dose of COVID19 vaccine I had flushing (warm rash like) all over my chest and neck that lasted for about an hour. No itching or hives. 1/9/21 at 3am my heart rate started to increase to about 110bpm while sleeping and continued till 4am. 1/9/21 at 4am my apple watch alerted me to my heart rate was above 120bpm while resting. This is when I realized I was sweating and felt like I had a fever.  I drank water and went back to sleep. 1/9/21 5am heart rate was at 135. then 6am 148bpm. 7am around 161bpm. Kept trying to go back to sleep. 1/9/21 8am got up and took an adult benadryl tablet and drank plenty of water. Tried to relax to lower my heart rate.  1/9/21 9am took another adult benadryl tablet and was able to get my heart rate just below 120 while sitting. Then ate breakfast and went back to bed. If heart rate was not going to lower, I was planning on going to the ER. 1/9/21 10am till next day. Heart rate was then under 100bpm. I was then so tired that I slept all day and did not eat anything else.  1/10 I experienced severe body aches, chills and headache. This was all day. 1/11 I woke up feeling mildly nauseous for about 3 hours and then dizzy for about an hour. after that I just had a sore arm. 1/12 Had a mildly sore arm.

                                                During the first few hours following vaccination, I had soreness at the injection sight and a mild headache. About 10hours later, I started to experience more severe symptoms including a fever of 101-102deg, chills/cold sweats, a moderate headache, and body aches. This continued throughout the night and into the next day. In addition, I began to experience a burning sensation in my chest, similar to heart burn. I have consistently been taking Tylenol and recently took Tums to aide with the heartburn feeling.

Woke up at 2:00am uncontrollably shaking with chills/goosebumps, sweating with shortness of breath. Extreme headache and all over body soreness also at that time.  This continued in waves for the next several hours. I finally slept for a short time and woke with continued headache and muscle/joint soreness. This was accompanied by dizziness, nausea and decreased appetite. This persisted throughout the entire next day following vaccination. The day after that was slightly better and the subsequent day I felt relatively back to normal.  I checked for fever many times throughout the symptoms but was always afebrile.

                                                1 week history of significantly worsened (previously present &#34;low back strain&#34; lower back pain that had become radicular to both LE and associated with progressively worsening bilateral LE weakness, paresthesias since COVID vaccination last week. see continuation for HPI and assessment/plan from office note 1/13/21  HPI from OV dated 1/13/21  She had presented initially in December 2020 for her annual physical, and we evaluated some low back pain that that time, felt to be a sprain/strain resulting from a fall in the shower earlier December which was aggravated significantly by lifting/transferring a patient at the SNF she works for as a nurse. Presentation at that time was rather benign, no imaging obtained, pt was placed on leave from work for 1 week to avoid the heavy lifting and likely aggravation of back pain, and rx including diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine. She did not FU in the office, but returned to work at SNF a week after I saw her for the back pain. She states she had improved enough to feel like she could go back to work but wasn&#39;t 100% without back pain yet. At no time was comp mentioned at the visit in December. She did tell her employer about the injury and was off of work for a week and was encouraged to seek comp. We were never notified.    Yesterday 1/12 she followed up in the office for the back pain and was found to have much more severe pain, now radicular to both LE (pain intensity worse on right), with new neurologic impairment including objective weakness bilateral LE (R&gt;L), sensation disturbance bilateral LE (R&gt;L). Xray of lumbar spine obtained in clinic, this was essentially unremarkable, non-acute.  Pt was sent for stat MRI of the lumbar spine. MRI last night revealed no findings to explain her severe symptoms - she has mild symmetric disc bulging at L5-S1  nd mild bilateral facet arthropathy with patent canal and foramina, and a mild nonspecific  &#34;STIR signal abnormality&#34; within the soft tissues abutting the left lateral aspect of the L5 spinous processes felt to be small and nonspecific. I did discuss the case and the imaging with the radiologist and he feels this is unlikely to be the source of her back pain/radicular symptoms. No obvious signs of apparent discitis or any signficant soft tissue abnormality.    Pt contacted last night with initial &#34;normal&#34; results of MRI as formal results were pending - hydrocodone was sent to her pharmacy for pain relief overnight. Pt received 60mg toradol in the office yesterday during her visit. Pt noted significant improvement in her back pain, bilateral leg pain about 30 minuts after that injection. She continued to have pain in the evening but went to sleep. She woke at 3am unable to roll over due to weakness and pain - her sister gave her a hydrocodone and she went back to sleep&#39; she woke this morning feeling much better; today, she has less severe low back pain, less severe right lower leg radicular pain, NO pain radiating into the left LE, lessening of the weakness in her right LE, lessening of paresthesia reported in the right LE (now isolated just to the heel), resolution of the weakness in the left LE, resolution of the tingling of the left knee. Other than the toradol and one dose of hydrocodone, no other medications were given, no other treatments given since presentation yesterday.   Upon further questioning, patient does reveal that she received the 1st of 2 COVID-19 vaccinations (pfizer) last week. She received the vaccination at work at nursing home on 1/7/21. She had some relatively quick onset nausea and dizziness within an hour of the injection, but that resolved. She recalls feeling like her low back pain, bilateral lower leg pain, leg weakness and paresthesias all intensified sometime either Wednesday 1/6/21 or 1/7/21, but more obviously worsened over the weekend 1/9 and 1/10. Along with the lower extremity symptoms, she does admit today that she experienced soreness in bilateral upper arms starting the day following the vaccine administration, with left arm/shoulder still feeling sore and tender to the touch now. She also developed some altered sensation of the right thumb and index fingers the day following vaccination (1/8/21) and this has been persistent/unchanged. She is right handed. No prior issues with right hand/fingers. Other than the altered sensation, she denies pain, swelling, or notable weakness. She is right handed, and really hasn&#39;t done much with her right hand over the past week since she hasn&#39;t been working. Patient denies having significant headache, fever, chills, diaphoresis, fatigue, rashes/injection site erythema since the covid vaccination. She was not told to sign up for or told about the V-safe program and hadn&#39;t thought to report her symptoms to work or think to be concerned regarding possible vaccine SE. Pt denies prior hx of low back pain, neurologic symptoms including weakness/paresthesias, previous allergy to or adverse reaction to vaccination or injectable medications. She has a history of latent TB(fully treated) but is otherwise in good health.  After gathering much further detailed information/history today from patient, review of chart including the MRI results and xray results from yesterday, my prior OV note, and discussion with radiologist today regarding her MRI - I Discussed with patient and her sister that I believe what is becoming more apparent to me now is that she is likely suffering from an adverse event associated with the COVID-19 vaccination she received on 1/7/21 through her workplace. I&#39;m unable to define this for certain, but I suspect that she developed the progressive worsening of low back pain, development of radicular pain and bilateral LE weakness and paresthesias about 1-2 days following the vaccination administration. She has had notable and rather surprising improvement in both subjective and objective findings  Today as compared to yesterday. Only intervention was toradol 60mg IM and one dose of hydrocodone, she had already been taking diclofenac or ibuprofen so I believe the only explanation for the improvement over the past 24 hours is the fact that she is gradually having resolution of the temporary paraparesis, neuralgia, paresthesia brought on by the recent COVID-19 vaccination. I believe she truly had injury to the low back in December, initial injury at home but had improvmenet and then significant worsening/exacerbation when transferring a resident at work. Her presentation following that was consistent with a strain/sprain of the lumbar spine. This was treated appropriately with rest, activity modification, stretching, NSAID, and muscle relaxers. She returned to work w/o restriction likely earlier than she should have but I believe the covid vaccination is likely what caused her condition to so significantly decline; Its also possible that her physically demanding job requiring lifting/transferring/standing for prolonged periods of time on top of an only partially resolved low back strain had aggravated her low back condition.    plan from OV dated 1/13/21 Given the improvement since yesterday, I recommended obtaining some labs looking for any sign of alternative explanation including infectious etiology or autoimmune/inflammatory condition, however will hold on further imaging as would be the plan, specifically EMG of the bilateral LEs. Explained to patient that I&#39;m hopeful with continued rest and time, her symptoms (weakness, tingling/numbness, radicular back pain) will completely resolve. She may need some eventual PT for the disc bulge in the lumbar spine and lumbar strain that is likely still lingering. Will contact pt with any change in care plan based on the laboratory findings. I would like to closely follow her, and make sure her symptoms continue to slowly improve /resolve. If at any point she develops worsening symptoms again or any new neurologic signs/symptoms (and we discussed what emergency signs/symptoms would be) then she needs to be in touch with me right away. I will work on reporting this suspected adverse covid vaccine reaction to VAERS / possibly also CDC and see if they have any additional input/suggestions for monitoring/treatment.    For pain control, pt may continue with the diclofenac OR ibuprofen, and the hydrococone/APAP as needed for breakthrough severe pain uncontrolled with the NSAID. I have advised pt to remain off of work at this time, resting at home avoiding lots of physical activity as she continues to heal. Suspect will have her follow up in clinic sometime next week for repeat evaluation/examination depending on VAERS/CDC recommendations and of course the lab results and any updated condition reports from the patient in the interim. Will want to make sure she has full resolution of the paresis and adequate resolution of her back pain/radicular pain prior to returning to work, even in a limited capacity. I am informed today that there is light duty available and will keep that in mind. Pt to be contacted regarding follow up. Encouraged to call with questions/concerns/updates. Pt was very thankful for the care.

I could not sleep that night after I received my vaccine. I decided not to go the ER and slept it off I woke up much better next morning. I saw a Doctor a couple of days later because I had shortness of breathing and a high heart rate while I was at work. He just told me to take it slowly at work. No meds.  I then started working part-time for some weeks and am being introduced again now to my regular scheduled.

                                                I received my second dose of the vaccine at 03:00pm on 1/12/21. I noticed around 06:00pm that I started feeling a little tired and some pain around the injection site. I had anticipated this as I felt similar symptoms from the first dose of the vaccine. I took a nap and woke up around 09:00pm feeling some of the worst body aches I had felt in a long time. My arm that I received my vaccine in was painful and warm to the touch. I felt dehydrated as well so I drank a pedialyte, took OTC Tylenol extra strength, and laid down again. Around 07:00am on 1/13/21, I still felt achy, sweaty, and felt pain in the arm that I recieved the vaccine in. I went into my bathroom, and noticed two small red and raised areas around the injection site. I took pictures of the site, and continued to closely monitor through out the day. I ended up calling in sick to work on 1/13/21. It is now around 12:00pm on 1/14/21, and I woke up with a pounding headache, muscle aches, dehydration, nausea, and low energy. I feel like I am hungover or have the flu, and am planning on calling in sick to work again. I reported my symptoms to my staffing department at my workplace on 1/13/21 and wanted to file a report here as well.

Following my first dose in the two-dose series, I did not experience any side effects other than the expected sore arm for 24-48 hours.

Physician stated, &#34;she had no medical conditions, she was in very good you know very like standing with herself.&#34; Patient had her 1st dose of Covid vaccine on unspecified date for COVID-19 immunization. Physician (reporter) stated, &#34;I am the parent of someone who got the COVID dose, the second dose yesterday. I am very concerned because my daughter yesterday (08Jan2021) started to have symptoms and fainted at 4:00 in the morning and hit her nose and has a scar now. She had her second dose yesterday (pending clarification), after the second dose last night she started to feel unwell, getting chills, nausea and when she got up to go to the bathroom, she fainted, she blacked out.

She said, she had to lay down and then her dad is there now because he is closer, he is going to be taking care of the urgent care but I want Pfizer to know what my daughter has gone through last night after she took this second dose.&#34; Physician further added, &#34;she is having a rash in her arm, she had little red in her bumps as well.

By the next day my headache became overwhelming and the the dizziness became so pronounced that I could not stand for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I a had an intolerable headache on the entire bottom of my head that made my neck start to hurt.   I felt nausea that did not improve until four days later. My joints were hurting sharply  two days after the immunization and lasted two days.    Most of my symptoms improved on the 13th of January, but were still lingering.  About 5 days after the shot my symptoms resolved completely.

This continued for about 30 minutes, I was debating going to the ED for the SOB. I then became really cold and had such bad shaking I couldn&#39;t hold anything for another 20 minutes.  Today I continue to have some tingling. All of this on top of the expected side effects.

                                                First Dose-  I had a headache after the shot and tremors started that even and throughout the night. No fevor. Arm very sore, going into neck.   Second Dose-  Felt find the night. Woke up that morning at 1am and with tremors and in a night sweat. Checked temp and it was only 96, but felt hot and was sweating. Woke up the next morning and my entire body, muscles and joints ached. My knuckles, ached, kept getting sharp pains in my knuckles. My jaw ached, difficulty eating. My entire body, my muscle ached, difficulty moving. I didn&#39;t get a headache till that evening. I also had severe heart burn that night, not sure if it was related, but I have never had heart burn that bad. The next morning when I woke up (5am) (now two days after my shot), again my joints hurts, I couldn&#39;t even stand.  Its like my knees couldn&#39;t even support me and I had a massive headache.  I went back to bed and woke around 9am, no longer had a headache, muscles still hurt. Around 11am, all of a sudden, muscles and joints felt fine.   The only thing (day three) is my arm pit on my left side where i got the shot is bothering my extremely bad.  I was able to put an ultrasound probe on my axilla area, and I have swollen lymph nodes in my axilla in the area that is very painful. I also have a dull pain in my elbow.

                                                Approximately thirteen hours after I received my second dose of the vaccine I started having cramping in my abdomen.  The cramping got increasingly worse and I started to get really bad chills.  The cramping feeling turned into a stabbing pain and reached a threshold that I could no longer stand so my husband had to drive me to the ER.  I have never been in so much pain.  Once it the ER I received medicine for the pain and a CT scan that revealed that I had appendicitis and needed to have it removed with an appendectomy.

                                                Upper middle and lower right abdominal pains that were consistent and nothing helped - random spurts of increased pain. 6 days after no relief, I made an appointment with a gastrointestinal doctor. On day 8, I had vomiting and multiple episodes of diarrhea. I saw the doctor on day 9 but there was so much all-over abdominal pain, it was difficult to decipher the cause. A ct scan was ordered but needed authed by the insurance. On day 10 of symptoms with no reflief, I went to the ER. After a ct scan, it was determined that appendicitis was present for probably 10 days which lead to a perforated appendix with abscess and inflammation around the appendix. While admitted to the hospital for 3 days, I was treated with IV antibiotics but the appendix could not be removed due to so much inflammation and abscess. I have a follow up in a few weeks to remove the appendix once another ct scan determines the area is cleared up.

Side effects began 2 days after her 2nd COVID vaccine. Pt was transferred to hospital from another institution due to O2 sat in the 60s (room air), leukocytosis, and AKI. Patient was treated empirically for sepsis/pneumonia as well as lupus flare. She was also initiated on high dose steroids. Possible reaction to vaccine. Chest CT showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and no signs of pulmonary embolism. Pt was transferred from hospital to another facility given progressive organ failure, most specifically liver failure.

                                                About 12 hours of receiving my second dose I started to get really bad chills. Nothing could keep me warm and I had a fever of 102.  I had muscle aches  as if I just went through a rigorous workout. I had zero appetite but I?m not sure if that was due to side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. When I did finally eat something that evening I could barely taste it, I ate it but my taste buds were faintly picking up the flavors. Again I don?t know if it was because of the side effects or the fact that I wasn?t feeling well. The following day, Saturday 01/09/21 I only had chills which would come and go. I did not have fever and my appetite was back. Now today, 01/10/21 I feel my usual self.

                                                I developed mild injection site pain about 5 minutes after the second dose which didn?t happen the first time so quickly. It shortly progressed to a cold/numb sensation from my deltoid down to my finger tips. This persisted but seemed to transition from more numbness to moderate pain from my left scapula, neck and down to my fingers about 7 hours after the vaccine. I also developed intermittent fasiculations of my forearm muscles on the left arm. This morning I woke up with worsening pain, mild numbness but new weakness in the hand and arm. I have a weak grip and can?t fully grab objects. My wrist flexión and extension are also weak as well as shoulder abduction (I am a neurologist by the way so can?t localize it to any nerve distribution). I?m not weak anywhere else and I only have mild arthralgia and diarrhea systemically.

Around 2:30am felt pressure and warmth (coming in waves) up towards my chest, lasting 1-2 seconds and occurring about every 5 minutes . Was able to withstand feeling until it became difficult to breath. Lips and face turned white and blue, fainted. Felt extremely nausea when awake.  Called 911. Vitals were normal apart from BP was very high 130/100&#39;s. EKG was NSR. Blood sugar taken was normal around 113. After 1 hour of event, I took a shower and drank water. I felt the wave one more time before trying to fall asleep. Then stopped. Woke up fine.

                                                Wednesday 1/13/2021 I woke up feeling like nauseous, then later in the day I started to get itchy in my lower body that was coming and going (I believe I still had some allegra d in my system). On  Thursday 01/14/2021 by noon time the itching had become extreme and unbearable all over my body and felt like my skin was crawling/burning, my chest and parts of my arms were really red . I also developed a lump in my throat that kept getting bigger and felt itchy and couldn&#39;t stop clearing my throat. Around 3pm I took 10ml of Claritin. The Claritin had not really helped however the redness had gone down a lot and by 4:30 I was miserable. Informed by a provider I work with to go to urgent care. I arrived at urgent care at about 5:10 where I was treated for an allergy reaction. I was given  0.9% sodium chloride IV bolus 500mL, Methylprednisolone sod suc(PF) (SOLU-Medrol) 125mg Intravenous, Famotidine (Pepcid) 20mg/2ml injection 20mg intravenous, diphenhydramine (Benadryl) 50mg/ml injection 25mg intravenous.  The itching subsided within 30 minutes, the itchy throat/ lump was still present but was not getting worse and slowly improving.   I was discharged home and was told to pick up famotidine 20mg, otc benadryl and prednisone 50mg to take for 5 days.  got home a little after 7 and was able to eat dinner, let dog out, shower, rest  before going to bed. I did take another 10 ml of Benadryl at 10:30. Woke up without any itchy skin at 5:45 and was able to return to work this morning. I still have a slight itchy throat but it is tolerable. I took allegra d and famotidine this morning. I am holding off on the prednisone because of the immune response to vaccines from steroids. I don&#39;t want to lessen the effectiveness of the vaccine.

                                                1022 - Patient received her 1st Pfizer vaccine by RN.  She noted a history of vasovagal syncope to needles in the past (did not seem like it was complete syncope to all needle sticks per RN).  RN offered for her to lie down, but she said she felt ok sitting.  She did not endorse any history of severe allergies or reactions to injectables in the past; she was asked the necessary questions prior to vaccination.  We later learned she has Crohn?s and is on immunosuppressant Imuran for this disorder.  1023ish ? walked to checkout area  1025 - While sitting at the checkout registering for her second shot she started to feel faint and checkout staff called for help  1026 - RNs were getting the BP cuff on her. She appeared obtunded and slouching in her chair- eyes closed. Gentle sternal rub and she was able to open her eyes and tell us what her name was and ask to call her dad. BP 90/58. Cold cloths placed on her neck. Continuous pulse ox monitor placed, showing 99%.  1030 - Still drowsy and diaphoretic. Able to tell us that &#34;she passes out when she gets shots&#34; C/O nausea and vomited. Still in and out of awareness. NP is site coordinator is now present and suggests taking patient by wheelchair to safer and more private area for evaluation in SR Room.  Patient able to stand and transfer to wheelchair, which we did slowly and carefully.  1034 ? Now in safer and more private area SR room with NP and RN and Dr. Firemen are here and assessing the scene with medic assessing patient. Ambulance in route, about 5 - 10 minutes out per radio communication.  Checking BP every 2  minutes.  Now is 68/44. C/O nausea and vomited. Pulse ox won?t pick up.  Patient with decreasing LOC, eyes rolling back in head, unable to maintain posture seated, and not able to describe symptoms to us (unknown if she felt itchy but no obvious cutaneous manifestations).  Unable to visualize oropharynx.  1037- BP 57/40. NP administered Epi pen 0.3 mg dose to L lateral thigh due to s/s of systemic allergic reaction/anaphylaxis including 3 known body systems: hypotension (cardiovascular), vomiting (GI), and decreased LOC (neuro). No IV fluids immediately available but were preparing to obtain.  Staff getting cot for patient to lie down.  Provider spoke with her mom on the phone and informed her of event. Mom confirmed that she has often before passed out with vaccines and blood draws. Dad was on his way to center and rerouted to ER.  1038 - BP 68/45 Talking to medics and able to tell them she ate breakfast and that she has a hx of Crohn&#39;s and takes a monthly injection. Informed provider that her dad was on his way. EMS team here to transport to ER.  We were preparing to put her on a cot so help with her blood pressure/blood flow when she started to stabilize and EMS arrived with stretcher.    1040 - BP 97/53.  Patient is now alert and talking to us.  Says she has had syncope in the past ?but never anything like this.?    1041 - BP 115/53. Patient still alert and talking.  Oriented x 3.  1042 - Transported to ER by EMS ambulance on stretcher.  DEBRIEF: Somewhat atypical (no obvious cutaneous manifestations) and rapid, severe reaction.  Ddx vasovagal vs anaphylaxis.  Response to epi consistent with anaphylaxis reversal.  Perhaps immunosuppressant medication contributed to severity and rapidity of reaction.

                                                Two days after receiving first dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine started feeling generally unwell. On the third day, started feeling progressively worse: dizziness upon standing and while standing (to the point I thought I would fall over) nausea, dry heaving, headache bordering on migraine, abdominal pain and a short period of appetite loss. Today (fourth day post shot) I called out of work and feel as if I?m on a tilt table while laying down, and will feel dizzy and nauseated immediately upon standing up. This is is spite of staying hydrated and eating a bland diet in order to not upset my stomach.

There were no medical history and concomitant medications. The patient stated she got the first dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine on Monday, 28Dec2020. She mentioned that she read the list of side effects and all the print outs and stated her events were not on there. She wanted to make sure and stated maybe it was not even from the vaccine. She reported she just came from the hair dresser, had hair colored before many times, but today (30Dec2020), when she put the dye on her hair, she broke out with what felt like a million bugs on her head and face, stated it is burning and itching, maybe it is her imagination. She knows there is a lot of paranoia. She reported that she has had hair colored before and this has never happened, it occurred during hair coloring treatment. She also mentioned that on 30Dec2020 (also reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;, pending clarification), she felt dizzy and nauseous; on 29Dec2020 (reported as &#34;yesterday&#34;), she felt bad and did not feel right all day, but says she knows those were listed symptoms. The outcome of the events dizziness, nausea, burning sensation and pruritus was recovering; the outcome of events paranoia and feeling abnormal was unknown.

Order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Benadryl given at 1025.   Dr also suggested that ID doctor be called.    At 1030, I got a hold of Dr., gave her a background story, and she advised that the pt stay for another 30 mins to be observed and she would come see the pt.    Dr. arrived at 1100, assessed the patient, and ordered Cetrizine Tab 10mg (Zyrtec) to give to pt, which Dr. had to get from another department. There was no Zyrtec available in emergency kit.   Again, order was on computer, but could not acknowledge or scan, so order detail was printed, and pt and I signed form together.   Zyrtec given at 1128. An additional Zrytec Tab 10mg was given at same time at 1128 &#34;for home use&#34; per Dr and per her order.    VS set #2 taken at 1133 Temp: 98.1 BP: 133/94 HR: 63 O2: 100% RR: 16   Dr suggested that she schedule an appt to see an allergist and to get an allergy test done prior to the next dose of the COVID vaccine.    Patient was feeling a lot better and more at ease.   Pt left comfortably with no symptoms at 1200.

                                                1/12 0715: Received Pfizer covid-19 vaccine dose 2 at end of shift. Went home to sleep after waiting 15 min.  1630: Woke up. Felt more tired than usual.  1900: Arrived at work. Felt fatigue and sore arm.  2000: Felt sore arm, fatigue, and mild HA. Drank coffee and this helped with fatigue and HA. 2100: Mild nausea starts. Still have sore arm. Less fatigue, no HA. Still able to eat with the nausea. 2200: Developed chills. I was putting up curtains in an isolation room and had to pause halfway through due to being short of breath as if I&#39;d done something strenuous. I then was short of breath again walking specimens to lab, which is unusual for me. Walking samples to lab involves walking 400 ft and going up and down 1 flight of stairs.  2300: Coworkers keep asking me why I&#39;m always out of breath. They are concerned. Chills are worse now and I go from feeling normal to feeling cold. My hands are like ice and I am gripping my arms to keep warm. I walk 2 samples to lab and each time I am dizzy on the way back. By the 2nd time I have to hold the wall to keep balance. I can no longer hide the side effects and a coworker offers me 650mg Tylenol. I gladly accept. I measure my spO2 and it is 97%.  1/13 0530: I am almost back to normal other than feeling fatigued.  0815: I get home and go to bed. My feet are ice cold so I have to wear socks, but my hands feel normal temperature. I feel like my blanket isn&#39;t warm enough.  1330: I wake up and feel absolutely miserable. I am going between having chills to having a hot flash. I can&#39;t seem to will myself to leave bed. I&#39;m pretty sure I have a fever, which I haven&#39;t had in over 10 years. My mouth is completely dry.  1400: I manage to roll out of bed and take my temperature, which is 101.3F. I feel an overall malaise and keep getting periodic hot flashes, but manage to make it downstairs and I mix 1 liquid IV electrolyte packet w/ 24fl oz. water. I drank the whole thing. I also cooked myself some dumplings and 1 waffle w/ maple syrup due to feeling much hungrier than usual.  1430: I take 1000mg Extra Strength Tylenol after eating.  1830: I feel almost normal except for significant fatigue and go to bed.  1/14 0430: I wake up and feel completely normal. No fatigue. Go about my day as normal. 1545: Suddenly I feel lightheadedness and mild HA. Have trouble with inattention (ex. not following w/ conversation or forgetting what people just said, or listening but not registering, or can&#39;t find the words to respond or answers to a question.). I take my Vitals: 117/95, spO2 85%, HR 63. I then try taking a couple deep breaths and spO2 increases to 98% and lightheadedness and HA go away. Then a few minutes later lightheadedness and HA begin again and spO2 is 80-90%. Then I take 2 deep breaths and spO2 is 98% and HA and dizziness improves. This repeats several times and I grow concerned. My hands are cold and the pulse oximeter is $30 from Amazon. However, I used the pulse ox on my mother and she was 97% consistently every time without fail. I also used pulse ox on myself when perfectly healthy and same thing it was 98%&#43; every time. This is why I was now worried. 1630: I take Tylenol since this seems to have helped with any and every symptom I&#39;ve had so far and book an Urgent Care appointment.  1700: I get up to take a shower and feel extremely dizzy to the point where I&#39;m worried I might fall. I stumble into the bathroom holding the wall. I take spO2 and it is 87%.  1800: I show up to Urgent Care and after the shower I feel my hands are warm now. At Urgent Care they are using  pulse oximeters and I am spO2 99% and HR 64. So they chalk it up to my crappy Amazon pulse ox and they tell me to hang in there. Perhaps if I had not taken a shower before going there it may have been a different story? Hard to say now. Also the Tylenol may have started to work by then.  2200: I am still inattentive, spacey, lightheaded, and fatigued. I then fell asleep on the couch without realizing.  1/15 0230: I wake up and feel fatigued with brain fog, but no more lightheadedness.  0630: I go back to bed because I&#39;m too sleepy.

Then, 1-14-21 starting around 8am, I developed GI symptoms, stomach cramping, nausea, and also light-headed and muscle aches. I left work and at home developed a headache and fever of 100.8 F which reduced to 100.2 F with ibuprofen. The fever went away over night so I came to work the next day 1/15/21 and continue to have stomach cramping and slight nausea and was concerned about the fever the day before so that is when I called employee health.

Very fatigued. At night I threw up and about 2AM I woke up drenched in sweat and I did not take my temperature. I woke up around 7AM and I had a migraine for about 2/3 hours - pounding headache. I took Tylenol, My body was really achy and my arm was like it was dead. General malaise, fatigue, it felt like I had a hangover, from my pounding headache. I threw up once again in the afternoon. Not sure if pregnancy related or the vaccine. Sunday morning I started feeling a little better. Saturday I felt horrible.

Around 7:00 that night began to have back pain, fever reached up to 102 around 2:00 am and took Tylenol. Felt very weak, headache, difficulty walking and decreased balance. On Jan 5, 2021 still had back ache and headache. On Jan 6, 2021 I felt better and began to have abdominal pain after eating dinner. I assumed it may be because of eating more then I had in past few days and did not attribute to much but the pain gradually increased to a strange burning/pressure across my upper abdomen that night. Very nauseous and ran low grade fever (99.45). Next morning I had less diffuse pain and could localize it to right lower quadrant.

                                                Injection site immediately felt severe itchy following injection but diminished after approx. 30-45 minutes.  I then felt fine until exactly 3:00 pm (approx. 3 hours following injection).  I stood up and immediately felt like passing out.  I had excruciating cramping throughout my legs and horrible joint pain in my knees.  By 3:30 I had hives covering my right hand- my hand was also very red and swollen and had severe itching/burning. By now I also had horrific joint and muscle pains all over my entire body and the leg cramping was even worse.  the hives responded well two doses of Benadryl and the muscle aches somewhat improved with rotation of ibuprofen and Tylenol.  By 5:00 am the following day, the joint and muscle pains were worse.  My entire body felt like it was on fire and I had excruciating pain in my throat.  It was difficult to speak or swallow and I could feel my throat swollen on the inside.  My neck was also slightly swollen and the lymph nodes on the left side of my neck were in horrific pain but not swollen.  I continued doses of Benadryl, ibuprofen and Tylenol all day and night and slept most of the time.  By Sunday Morning, my throat felt even worse and I had 100 degree fever and continued body aches and joint pain.  I was seen at a local urgent care who ran various tests (see below) that were negative and advised me to treat as if it were an allergic reaction and go to ER if I got any worse.  Fever and pain improved by Monday and by Tuesday I was able to return to work but with significant fatigue and continued pain in my legs.  I continued to improve throughout the week.  Now the following week I overall feel back to normal other than I have continued leg pain, esp. in my knees by the end of the day.

The patient had no relevant medical history. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in Hospital. The patient reported that she was fine all day Saturday (16Jan2021), she just had some very mild pain at the injection site started a couple hours after getting injection. She developed flu like symptoms on the following day (17Jan2021) at 18:00PM and threw up a couple times. On 18Jan2021 at noon she noticed that she could barely move her arm: anything above her elbow on her right arm was not moving; it was paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up. If someone were to pick it up and let go, she couldn&#39;t control it at all. She also stated that she had no pain at all in that arm; she couldn&#39;t feel anything at all; it was numb. When she woke up on 19Jan2021 the numbness had moved up her neck, instead of being localized to her arm. She stated that when she touched her neck, it hurt a little, but it was not super significant. She stated that it was debilitating at that point as she was maintaining numbness and &#34;no control of her arm&#34;. The nurse reported that this event had not required yet a visit to physician, but she has a feeling it will. She will probably have to go somewhere due to her paralyzed arm, but she had not yet. At the time of the report the event &#34;No control of her arm&#34;/can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; had not resolved yet; the event &#34;mild pain at the injection site&#34; resolved on 17Jan2021, the events &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; and &#34;Threw up a couple times&#34; were recovering and outcome of the events &#34;Numbness has moved up her neck&#34; and &#34;She touches her neck, it hurts a little&#34; was unknown.  The reporter assessed the events &#34;Pain injection site&#34; and &#34;Flu like symptoms&#34; as non-serious and assessed the event &#34;Can barely move her right arm; paralyzed at the shoulder from the elbow up; it&#39;s numb&#34; as disabling. She assessed all the reported events as related to BNT162B2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (method of assessment: Global Introspection).; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the events numbness of upper extremity and arm paralysis with BNT162b2 use can not be fully excluded.

                                                Acute appendicitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician reporting for herself. A 31-year-old female patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EK4176), intramuscular in the left arm, on 16Jan2021 at 18:30, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included iron deficiency anaemia, migraine and drug allergy to amoxicillin. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. Concomitant medications included multivitamin and ferrous sulfate (unknown manufacturer). Previously the patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech, lot# EH9899), on 26Dec2020 at 04:15 PM, intramuscular in left arm for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient experienced acute appendicitis on 20Jan2021 at 09:00 with outcome of recovering. The patient went to the emergency room and was hospitalized due to the event in Jan2021 for 1 day. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the event and included laparoscopic appendectomy. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 PCR test (nasal swab): negative on 20Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Given the nature of the medical condition and the overall clinical picture, the event appendicitis is most likely an intercurrent medical condition and is assessed as unrelated to bnt162b2.

Tried to go for a walk outside and found a 30 minute very slow walk extremely tough  12/30-1/2 Moderate sore throat continues. Other symptoms gone 1/1-2 Arm/ injection site soreness slowly fades  1/2: exercise for the day= 70 min yoga and 7.5 miles of walking. Had a couple glasses of wine at dinner (possibly relevant if issues with vaccine are related to high histamine food issues)  1/3  Moderate headache, fatigue, and muscle aches. Skin feels hot. Sore throat worse than the previous days. Mild runny nose. Severe nausea. Go to Urgent care for COVID test and Zofran Rx. COVID rapid test and PCR test both negative.

                                                As soon as I received my shot it was like an electric shot from the injection shot, up the back of my neck, into my brain. I was instantly woozy and disoriented. They moved me to observation. My hemiplegic migraine started within 10 minutes of the vaccine. I take a preventative every day, and to be honest after the vaccine it was like I had never, ever taken my preventatives. The migraine I got that day is the worst one I have experienced since the first one I ever got.   Now on top of the migraines, the vaccine gave me waves of new symptoms. I was having spells of intense heat flashes, with wooziness, and nausea. So the new symptoms were paired with the hemiplegic migraines that, if you aren?t familiar with, mimic strokes because my whole left side tends to go limp, and I struggle with speech, and cognitive issues. So it really wasn?t all too long before the nurse kindly suggested that I didn?t look great and we should head to the ED.  They treated the migraine, gave me a CT, everything came back fine. They reached out to my neurologist, gave me some fluids, really they wanted to keep me a little longer, but I know the migraine drill and just wanted to go home and sleep and eat. I promised to follow up with my neurologist and fill out my CDC form.  Over the next week the migraine and extra symptoms seemed to slowly but surely let up. The only note worthy thing was really that my left side would get extra tender at times. Not just my injection site, but it was almost like all my nerve endings all over my left side were on fire at times and a pinch on the thigh may as well have been a stab, or a pat on the back a punch. It was pretty intense at times.   And just when I thought it was all over my menses started, you see my hormones trigger my migraines. And once again it was like I wasn?t on a preventative. I had an intense Migraine start. I was able to take my bail out medication (sumatriptan) though and get to work. I moved forward with my day, and just when I thought all was normal, I got one of those brutal heat flashes, the room started moving, and I was nauseous. Unfortunately I was in full PPE, I almost passed out, I had to get a coworker to help, they had to get my supervisor. It was a big, unnecessary-necessary, pride-wounding scene.  Now I am not a scientist or a doctor, but I might speculate that people with neurological deficits, like myself, are going to have a harder time with this inactive Covid strand. I would much rather be immune to Covid then catch it though, so whatever I can do to help, and protect myself and family and friends and neighbors, I will absolutely do... But I imagine there is probably an adjustment to be made here for the neurologically impaired.  Thanks for your time, and let me know if you have any questions.

                                                About 5 minutes after receiving my second dose I became flush, and hot from the outside in over my whole body.  I was tingly all over.  I felt shaky  and like I was going to pass out. Very nauseous.  My blood pressure was 169/93 @ 0830. The staff had me lay down.  About  5 min later I started to feel better.  Another 5 min later it happened again in a wave. The symptoms just came over me. My blood pressure @ 0840 was169/104. The staff had me drink water and rest. @0900 the wave came over me again. My BP was 178/111. I drank more water and rested. BP recheck @ 0925 162/112.  @940 BP was slowly coming down at 145/109. At that time they transferred me to the Emergency room.  My BP came back into normal ranges, and the waves stopped happening around 12pm. I was then released home with plans to follow up with Primary care on  1/11/2021

The next day I took scheduled alternating Tylenol &amp; ibuprofen during the day and then overnight 1 episode of chills that woke me up. no events Saturday or Sunday. Then Monday 1/11 in the early morning I started to develop a rash on my b/l elbow and right foot 3rd toe. I applied mometasone topical cream to these locations. while at work the rash extended down both forearms then by 5pm it was on both hips and extending along both legs. I applied Benadryl cream to the most irritated sites and took PO Benadryl 50mg at bedtime and again at 1am when the itching woke me up. I repeated Benadryl 25mg at 8am. The rash seems to be getting better on the arms but then by noon I had a new breakout on my neck and face. I took Benadryl 50mg at 1pm. The rash continued to have a rapid progression over the next hour and resulted in angioedema with my throat swelling, lips puffed and numb and eye swelling. I was injected with an epi pen and sent to the ED where I received PO prednisone, famotidine, and Benadryl. The face/neck rash then greatly improved and I was sent home on prednisone 40mg daily for 3 days.

Upon receipt of follow-up information on (04Jan2021), this case now contains all required information to be considered valid.  This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 32-year-old female patient started received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE lot/batch number not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on the left deltoid on 15Dec2020 at SINGLE DOSE for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital.  Medical history included irritable bowel syndrome.  Concomitant medications included fexofenadine hydrochloride (ALLEGRA), famotidine (PEPCID), ethinylestradiol, norgestimate (CILIQUE) for birth control and multivitamin. It was stated that the patient got the vaccine on 15Dec2020. On 17Dec2020, she developed severe abdominal pain radiating to her upper and her middle back with pretty bad nausea, fatigue and headache. It was also mentioned that the patient had stomach cramps. These continued all the way until like Christmas. And then on the 19Dec2020, she actually got her menstrual cycle though she was not due to start that till that week. So, it came like almost two and a half weeks early (which was super weird as for her). The patient took ondansetron (ZOFRAN) for the nausea; aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide (MAALOX); famotidine and hyoscyamine for like stomach cramping. She also took that as well, acetaminophen (TYLENOL) and ibuprofen (MOTRIN). It was mentioned that the symptoms stopped on 26Dec2020 then she sinus infection right after in Dec 2020. Outcome of the event of sinus infection was unknown while the remaining events recovered on 26Dec2020. The patient stated that the she don&#39;t think that sinus infection was correlated at all but all other symptoms were happening right after the vaccine (reported as related).  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The event sinus infection is likely intercurrent and is unrelated to suspect drug BNT162B2.

                                                I work as an occupational therapist in acute care. On 12/28, I was helping a patient transfer from supine to sit. She required maximal assistance, and I was briefly in an awkward position with my trunk flexed and rotated towards the right during this transfer. I felt a pull in my left lower back. After this, I iced the area and took 400 mg ibuprofen and this relieved the mild pain I had.  The following two days, I made an effort to follow back precautions (avoid bending, lifting, twisting), avoided heavy lifting at work. On 12/29 in the morning, I felt only a mild soreness in my left lower back and was able to go on my workday without issue (avoiding heavy lifting) On 12/29 around 3 pm I received the first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine. On 12/30 (day off work) from the time I woke up until around early afternoon I felt a mild weakness and heaviness in both of my legs. It was most notable when I was standing to cook for about  20-30 minutes that my legs felt shaky and I felt the need to sit. I was able to finish cooking without sitting, however, this sensation was abnormal for me as I normally am on my feet for most of the day with an active job without feeling shaky or weak.  Around 22:00 on 12/30 I had severe nausea for about an hour or so. I can&#39;t fully remember, but several days after 12/28 or 12/29 I started to feel a mild cold sensation in my lower back. I attributed this potentially to my mild back injury, but it was unclear.  The sensory change was intermittent and mild, and ongoing until recently. On 1/9 while at work, I started to feel a mild cold sensation below my belly button, in addition to the intermittent lumbar back cold sensation area. On 1/11 at work, the sensory changes to my lower abdomen and back were more apparent after assisting in a maximal assist transfer with a patient.  At this time, it was a combination of cold and burning sensations.

She attributed this to excitement from completing vaccine series and finished her 15 minute wait time. She went home but it became harder to swallow and she felt like her chest was &#34;heavy&#34; and she became short of breathe walking up stairs. She took fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg and  filed a report with the CDC. Her symptoms resolved and she slept. The morning after her vaccine she felt fine and went for a 6 mile run. She called vaccine clinic to see what kind of follow up she needed to completed and was asked to contact PCP and employee health.  She presented to PCP that day (day after second vaccine) who reported ongoing symptoms of moderate chest tightness and some throat discomfort. Given prescription for Medrol dose pack, albuterol inhaler, and EpiPen and instructions on when to present for care.

Felt great rest of day. @0500 on 1/28 woke up shivering uncontrollably. Mild fever of 100.5(highest recorded during this whole episode). Body aches, chills, sweats, headache rest of day. 1000 mg Tylenol helped with fever/chills but headache progressed to migraine w/nausea. Took 50 mg sumatriptan and 25 mg doxylamine in evening and this seemed to help with headache and allow me to get to sleep 1/28.  Woke up at 0300 1/29 with chills/cold sweats. Took 1000 mg Tylenol again (didn&#39;t check temp) and went back to sleep. Woke up at 0530 for work - checked temp since I&#39;m a healthcare worker and it was 100.4 (with tylenol). Waited until clinic opened up and called them at 0700 for recommendations on going to work or not (temp by then was 99.8, with tylenol). Was advised to stay home and if febrile tomorrow to get COVID tested on 1/30. As of right now (1300 on 1/29) headache has returned but mild. Body aches still. Temp 99.4 w/tylenol redosed at 1000.

The chills went away after the first day. The 2nd day I still had a fever. Day 3 I had significant nausea in conjunction with headache. These symptoms have continued from days 4 - today, day 11 post vaccine. While they are improving, after the initial fever/ chills my symptoms translated to into seemingly hormonal with nausea, strong food aversions, headaches (that felt hormonal) and 4&#43; days with substantial constipation and fatigue. It has mirrored the sickness I experienced with both pregnancies however I am not pregnant. I am still experiencing a mixture of fatigue,  headaches, nausea and food aversions (food still does not taste normal).

The fever improved this morning around 9 am, however I continued to have headache, myalgia, and fatigue all day.  I also have intermittent nausea and difficulty standing or walking around because of feeling like I will pass out.  I feel slightly improved tonight but still not normal.  I called the employee health this morning to inform them.

On 1/8/21 at around 10:00am I got a headache of moderate severity behind my right eye and at right temple.  It was associated with nausea and fatigue.  I took 800mg ibuprofen and 4mg zofran.  At 12:00 I left work and went home and slept for 4.5 hours between 12:30 and 5pm.  I woke up at 5pm and had minimal residual headache in the right temple.  After going to sleep from 8pm to 6am, I awoke on 1/9/21 and my headache was completely resolved.    I do have a history of migraine headaches.  This headache and associated nausea felt like my previous migraine headaches and the course was similar to my previous headaches.

She said she got dizzy, extremely hot and felt like she was &#34;swaying&#34; She said she also got what she described as &#34;menstrual like cramps&#34; that radiated all around her abdomen and back. She was under observation as advised per Pfizer protocol.  An associate of the Pt noticed she passed out for a second she then turned beet red from her head to her neck as we could see. The associate yelled for us to grab a BENADRYL. They hooked her up to a BP machine and she did present with a spike in BP.  After a few minutes, the redness and symptoms subsided. She was observed by the medical staff at the facility.

                                                12/20: 10 mins after the injection my arm started hurting so I was moving it around and suddenly a felt a tickle in my throat, swallowed and felt like I swallowed the wrong way and was coughing to the point of feeling like I was going to vomit. Per everyone around I was bright red and I looked weird. The ER nurse said my heart rate was 125 and my systolic BP was elevated at 130s (normally in the 110s). After sitting for 45 mins heart rate was back to 60s. Still felt like I was in a fog but felt ok. Once I walked to my car I felt alot of nausea again and was on and off the rest of the day.  In the middle of the night I woke up short of breath laying on my back had to lay on my side.  12/21. I was moving pavers and got short of breath. Checked my heart rate and it was 100. O2 sat was 99%. If I sat and didn&#39;t move I was fine as soon as I started moving it started again. Also felt nauseating all day. I was having a hard time concentrating and my husband was getting frustrated that I wasn&#39;t understanding what he was saying. My left arm hurt really bad all day  12/22 By the afternoon felt more normal except my arm still hurting really bad.  12/26 was shoveling dirty and suddenly my arm where I got the injection started hurts and I got very nauseated again.  On 12/29 the cdc called me because I did the vsafe program. They were wondering if I was actually going to get the second vaccination because they said my reaction is a severe reaction.  12/30 my arm started itching had chills and temp right after  1/1 rapid test was negative for covid  1/2 pcr was negative

I became very faint and nauseous and felt as though i was going to throw up. open my door and took my mask off to help with getting air and it didn&#39;t do much to help. I felt very light headed and uncomfortably closet o passing out than i ever have. This lasted for a good 10 minutes until it slowly passed. Faint, nauseous, hot and rapid heart rate of 130 were my main symptoms and were very uncomfortable.

I was feeling better by the 21st and now symptoms have resolved.

It lasted until about 24 hours after the vaccine. Over the last week, I?ve had horrible insomnia, waking up multiple times throughout the night with difficulty falling back asleep. I didn?t think much of it other than it?s very unlike me until a handful of other coworkers vaccinated around the same have also been experiencing this.

                                                I started experiencing soreness to left arm about 1-2 hours after injection but nothing else. I went to bed around 11pm. Then I was woken up in the night around 3am violently shaking, teeth shattering and unable to even stand straight from shaking so bad. I felt like I was freezing but skin was hot to touch. I didn&#39;t have a thermometer to take temperature at that time because it was in another family member&#39;s room. I felt nauseated as well. I took 600mg ibuprofen and tried to lay back down. At 3:59am my aunt woke and brought the thermometer downstairs. I could tell the ibuprofen was working some and fever was less as the shaking had calmed. I was able to check my temperature and it was 100.8F (an hour after the ibuprofen). I still took 100mg tylenol at that time.  As of this morning (after 7am) I am sore all over, tired and have a headache, temp 99.2F.

A 34-year-old female patient (pregnant: No) received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via intramuscular (lot number: EL1283) on left arm on 08Jan2021 at 6:30 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The relevant medical history included celiac, anemia, known allergies: Sulfa and Gluten. Concomitant medications were not reported. The patient received first dose of BNT162B2 via intramuscular (lot number: Ek5730) on left leg on 18Dec2020 at 11:00 AM at single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient previously took Codeine, fish oil and experienced allergies. Friday at 3pm, the patient had numbness and tingling to left hand, lips and throat. On Saturday the patient had sweating, chills, headache, nausea. On Sunday had emergency appendectomy for actuate appendicitis. Post surgery had allergic reaction unknown reason with head to toe rash.

The adverse events resulted in Emergency room/department or urgent care. The events were reported as serious due to life threatening and hospitalization. The most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered at hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be excluded based on a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

Medical history included Crohn&#39;s disease from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, COVID-19 in 2020 to an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  Concomitant medication included vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) for Crohn&#39;s disease.  The reporter is a physician who is reporting and AE for a patient who received the vaccine and subsequently developed symptoms including short of breath, fever, headache, nausea, difficulty swallowing with seriousness criteria of Medically significant on 03Jan2021. The patient self-medicated with benadryl and symptoms resolved briefly but then went to urgent care with re-occurring symptoms and was prescribed prednisone. Caller states the patient&#39;s symptoms have resolved. She is calling to get more information to determine if the patient should receive the second dose. The reporter further stated that she has a patient who received her first shot, clarified as the COVID-19 Vaccine. About an hour and 45 minutes later, the patient had shortness of breath and then later had a fever, headache and nausea. It was later that night when the patient had a fever. The patient had difficulty swallowing which worsen; she was feeling as if her throat was closing. The patient is a nurse, so she self medicated with Benadryl. After taking the Benadryl, the patient was better in the early morning. When the doctor&#39;s office opened, the patient called and was having similar symptoms, clarified as all the symptoms mentioned above. The patient went to the urgent care where she received more Benadryl and was started on prednisone. Caller did not know the dose of prednisone the patient had received. After that, the patient started feeling better. The patient&#39;s second dose of the COVID19 Vaccine is due around 24 to 26Jan2021. The patient has not called the doctor/caller back.

At ~ 0500 on 1/14/21 (~18 hrs after vaccine), I woke up as I was in SVT. I was not able to convert myself and had to go to ED for treatment. HR was 232 upon arrival to ED. Prior to administering adenosine, SVT resolved on own. SVT episode lasted ~2hrs.  I have not had a prolonged SVT episode since ablation in 2016. ER doc mentioned that perhaps fever/ illness from vaccine lowered my threshold for going into SVT.

Felt as if I was intoxicated, lasted the whole day. Woke up the next morning and still felt &#34;out of it&#34; and weak but thought it would get better, went to work (im a nurse). Started having continous vomiting, shortness of breath and chest pain at work. As well as severe tremors. I was taken to the hospital, given fluids and my QT was prolonged with my heart which i have never had before . Was given iv magnesium and waited for my heart rhythm to improve. Was told not to take anymore of my prescribed medications or nausea medications and follow up with my pcp the next day. Im still feeling horrible, nausea, body aches, low grade fever and I am 72 hours out. Now I have huge hospital bill to pay, can&#39;t work currently because I still feel bad and my heart has a weird rhythm. Hoping this helps as if this was what I was expecting I would have never got it.

Injection site arm pain and stiffness was noticeable by 12pm, and gradually worsened to incredibly painful by 8 pm, especially in muscles between left  shoulder blade and spine. Chills began around 9:30pm at which point I took one 500mg Tylenol and went to sleep. I woke up with severe chills around 1:45 am and pushed off taking more 500mg Tylenol until 2:45 am. Afterwards I began to feel heartburn and slight nausea but was able to fall back to sleep. I woke up around 3:45 am to vomit. Afterwards, the nausea subsided and I was able to go back to sleep until 6:45am. I woke up with a headache which got worse and I took one Aleve at 9 am. By late afternoon I was feeling much better.

This was approx 16 hours post dose. I took 600mg of ibuprofen and felt more able to do normal home activities but still tired with a sore arm. 4.5 hours post ibuprofen dose I again had muscle aches, headache, fatigue, and nausea. I also had chills and joint pain. I napped for an hour, took another 600mg ibuprofen, and then napped for another 2.5 hours. After that I felt better at 27 hours post dose but still achy and fatigued. These symptoms had mostly resolved by 31 hours post dose.

Took Ibuprofen 20 hours post vaccine because I developed a severe headache in addition to nausea. Headache became less intense, but all other symptoms remained at the same intensity. I fell asleep and woke up with a 103F at 28 hours. Pain persisted as well. I went back to sleep and woke up at 7pm when the fever broke, I noticed all the other symptoms were gone except for some new neck pain. The neck pain could be related to how I slept though since it was new. I did not take any more medication and went back to bed later in the evening. I woke up at 4am, roughly 29 hours post vaccine, with a fever and didn&#39;t take my temperature, but did take 1000 mg Tylenol. It broke an hour later. I have had waves of symptoms of a low grade fever all day (slight chills), which then feels like it breaks on its own indicated by sweat and chills disappearing. I haven&#39;t had to medicate any further however and in comparison to yesterday I feel amazing!

A 35-year-old female patient (weight 55.79 kg, height 160 cm) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (Pfizer-Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine, Lot. EK5730) intramuscularly, in the left deltoid, at single dose, on 23Dec2020 at 12:30, for COVID-19 immunisation.

The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.

                                                That morning I had taken amlodipine for the 2nd time in my life to help Raynaud&#39;s.  Both times I have taken amlodipine now I have felt lightheaded and less cognitively sharp than normal basically the entire day.  I received the above Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine around 12:45 PM, within about 3-5 minutes of receiving the vaccine and standing in line to check out I suddenly felt I was going to loss consciousness/collapse so started lowering myself to the ground and then became unconscious and fell.  Healthcare staff informed me I was unconscious for about 20-30 seconds. I woke up and initially felt confused, but quickly realized what had happened.  Then I felt nauseated, had some stomach cramps and thought I was going to have diarrhea.  They considered giving me Epi for possible anaphylaxis, but I requested they observe further for any skin reaction/hives, airway symptoms, etc given I was skeptical the syncope may have been fully or partially related to the amlodipine I took that morning.  Symptoms slowly improved over 20-30 minutes, but the lightheaded feeling and nauseated lasted hours.  No Epipen, medications, or interventions were needed.

The body aches, nausea, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes continue to inhibit my ability to perform ADLs and I was unable to work today.

She went to the ER; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse. This nurse reported for a 35-year-old female patient (Daughter) received 2nd dose of BNT162B2 (COVID-19 Vaccine lot number: EK9231, Expiry date: Apr2021) on 16Jan2021 at single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history reported was She was positive, our whole family had COVID and we all came down which was about the same time which was 29Dec. Concomitant drug were not reported. Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am calling for my daughter. She received her 2nd vaccination yesterday morning and she had some side effects. Like about 6 o&#39;clock this morning she came in, she came in 6:35, she came and woke me up and said that she felt some of the reaction she is having. She has nausea, she has slight temperature 99.7, fatigue. Just a general feeling of aches and pains. It does not seem like it&#39;s an emergency. She was treated in the ER with steroids and since that point we have all recovered until she went for the 2nd. She works in a hospital, she got her 2nd dose of vaccine like I said yesterday morning. &#34;Retired Nurse stated, &#34;I am not sure causality. I mean it is not an emergency. She was feeling fine yesterday. We all are feeling better now. She had the vaccine and last night she said she had a sore throat when I looked at her throat. Her throat seemed red but there was no angioedema or anything like that, she went to sleep and she came in &#39;feeling really&#39; (voice distortion) sick. So, I do not know. Did they have relapses from the COVID? I do not know.&#34; Treatment was &#34;Tylenol.&#34; Like I had said that she was feeling heavy with her chest. She went to the ER. She was at her work. She went to the ER.&#34; &#34;Probably close to 10 days ago, they did lab work I think they might have been looking for a clot. They did do some lab work at the hospital with unknown results.&#34; Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.

                                                Injection received at 0815. At 0900 I started getting diaphoretic, clammy, nauseas and my face was flushed. At 0930, I developed hives on my neck, chest and arms. I immediately went back to the vaccination site (I was still in the hospital at work) and was administered 25mg oral Benadryl and monitored for 30 minutes. The hives resolved, but I still felt unwell. At 1600 I noticed a swelling in my right upper thigh about the size of my hand. It was about 2 inches inferior to my inguinal crease and was the width of my thigh. It was mildly painful to the touch. My injection site was red, inflamed and itchy. I continued taking 25-50mg Benadryl Q4  and took 100 mg at night due to itchiness on my eyes, face, neck, chest and arms. This is still present, although less each day, as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I have felt feverish but have not had a recorded fever. I took some Ibuprofen for the pain in my arm at the injection site. The redness, swelling and itchiness has decreased each day at the injection site, but is also still present as of Monday 1/4/21 morning. I still feel unwell and have continued diarrhea throughout the weekend.

                                                I worked the night of 18th and 19th (night shift nurse) -  night of 18th  - arm very sore (dominant arm where shot was taken) by end of night arm was sore; continued for several days. (Got my period either the night of 18th or morning of 19th). About 36 hours after vaccine; stood up to attend an alarm and felt very ill at patient&#39;s bedside and had to sit down: nauseous (felt similar to co-vid) - took Motrin an hour later; the day of 20th - slept all day; 21st - no appetite; mild headache - nauseous - period at same time of vaccine; 22nd - felt bleh; didn&#39;t eat much food - period going away but I  was feeling worse; feel like I have the return of internal vibrations (can sit in my hands when I&#39;m trying to do something for a patient that needs done quickly)  back in July when I had Co-Vid (when I was out of work out of month - and had to see a cardiologist - two months until normal (neural and cardiac symptoms that went away with time) - so was returning of buzzing/etc. 23rd: could feel like I had internal vibrations sensations; nauseous - increased - got a refill from an old dental prescription - started Zofran; headache pressure (head pressure); a vertigo-ish feeling - felt like I just walked off a boat; at that point - called out of work - COVID hotline hospital call - did a rapid test that was negative (on 24th) and on 24th: had still all the same symptoms - nausea was worse and felt a bit more dizzy occasionally and called out of work again but could take care of myself (laid around) - &#34; it felt like baby covid&#34; 25th - work wanted me to get tested again; 26th - Panther Co-vid test - which was also negative. 27th and 28th - dizziness better; still taking Zofran one time /day (for nausea); was able to go to work on 29th - still had some nausea but didn&#39;t have to lie down all day anymore - still had internal vibrations - feels like I should be having a tremor but can&#39;t see it externally; 30th finally able to see primary care Dr and she ordered lab work: Dr wasn&#39;t certain it was an adverse effect vs. me feeling my own immune response to spike protein; Initial covid symptoms in July were similar to this; and she will see how things go; SED Rate was 1 so not concerning; CBC was fine and B12 was fine. Not much as changed since then: returned to work; can go about things in every day; stopped taking Zofran on 31st; I still had nausea but it was mild enough that I didn&#39;t need to take it and Dr said it would be best to stop due to it&#39;s on effects. Yesterday, was first day with no nausea (1/4/2021); still have internal vibrations sensation but it has gone down quite a bit - now more of a mild buzzing electric current sensation - like insides are buzzing super fast ; when I noticed when not occupied with other things which is how it faded out with original illness.

It quickly went down hill with a fever, chills, worsening joint and muscle pain everywhere, nausea, severe fatigue, worsening sore throat, tingling and numbness in all extremities at random locations. It is now 3pm, about 21 hours since vaccination-fever has broken once (I took ibuprofen at 2pm) but returned but not as high, and severe headache with light sensitivity. The joint pain and numbness has faded but I am left with severe muscle soreness, like I was in a car accident. Oh and I lost taste sometime today. Also I had injection site pain for both doses, starting the morning after.

                                                - Almost immediate onset of nausea, sore throat, headache, and sensation of fast heart rate; along with feelings of mild illness (like a cold) and arm pain which is consistent with other vaccination response.   - Waited at clinic for 30 minutes as directed due to previous history of anaphylaxis to injected meds (among others). Reported feeling poorly to nurse monitoring people waiting at 30 minute mark, who encouraged waiting longer but did no further assessment. Waited another 15 minutes with no resolution or improvement. Decided to leave and monitoring staff said they could not keep patients if they wanted to leave.   - Approximately 15 minutes later (1hr after injection), took one 25mg Benadryl liquid gel as nausea/headache/fast heart rate were consistent with prior allergic reaction and not with prior vaccine response. Those symptoms resolved after 1-2 hours; the feeling of mild illness lingered for approx. 3 days more.

                                                Syncope at approximately 5:20am this morning. I had been awake and active for about 30 minutes getting ready for work. As I was walking to my kitchen, I suddenly became very dizzy with blurred vision, tingling hands, nausea, ringing in my ears, and I felt like I was going to lose control of my bowels. I became very weak in the legs and I made it to the couch before I fell. Episode lasted approximately 2 minutes. As I laid down, my symptoms recovered. My husband gave me some juice and toast. After about 20 minutes, I got up and was able to walk without symptoms. I felt perfectly normal prior to this event. Last night, I ate a full dinner and drank about a liter of water. This event did not seem to be precipitated by hypoglycemia or dehydration. For the rest of this day, I have felt normal.

Within 10 minutes I had tachycardia (130s), high BP (160s), lightheadedness, nausea, headache, and feeling like I was going to faint. I was attended to by Ambulance paramedics. At the time of her report to her primary care provider on 1/7/2021, she was still having pretty significant side effects (headache, dizziness, and light sensitivity), enough so that I was staying home from work. These symptoms have now resolved.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first single dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) (lot number EL1284, expiry date not provided) on 23Dec2020 09:15 intramuscularly in the left arm for COVID-19 immunisation (reported as preventive). There was no relevant medical history and no concomitant medications. The nurse (patient) received her first dose of the vaccine on 23Dec2020 at the hospital that she worked at. She was kept there for 15 min for monitoring and she felt fine. About 30 minutes post vaccination she got a hot flash, a flush over her face, she does not know if she was red but she felt flush. Her tongue felt strange, nothing swelled that she could tell, it felt hard to swallow, to make the motion to swallow it felt kind of sluggish. She felt weird swallowing which lasted for only a few minutes. She never struggled to breathe. She went back to park in the hospital parking lot since she was not sure if she was experiencing a anaphylactic reaction and then after a few minutes it went away. Her arm was sore and heavy feeling for that day. She had drowsiness for a couple of hours and pain and redness at the injection site for a couple of days that was not bothersome, it was mild. No relevant test. She wanted to know if she should get the second dose of the vaccine due to the symptoms she had after the first dose. The pain and redness at injection site was resolved on an unspecified date in Dec2020, while the other events were resolved on 23Dec2020.  The reporting nurse considered the events hot flash, flush all over her face, arm was sore and heavy, drowsiness, pain and redness at injection site were non-serious, while the events &#34;tongue felt strange, it was sluggish to swallow&#34; were serious that she drove back to the hospital (no emergency room/phycian office visit). She considered the events were related to the vaccine.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contributory effect of suspect BNT162Bw on the reported events cannot be excluded.

A 36-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 04Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included COVID-19 from Mar2020 to an unknown date.  The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient experienced body aches, dry mouth, can&#39;t sleep, generalized weakness, decreased appetite, and pain at the injection site, temp was 38.1 Celsius, head feels weird in Jan2021. The patient got her first dose and was looking online to see the symptoms. She said that she saw that during the trials, people were experiencing the symptoms she was experiencing after the second dose and she was concerned. She said that she wanted to make sure her symptoms are ok and to make sure that the symptoms are not just caused from the booster, but also from the first dose. The caller said that her mom told her that someone died from the Pfizer vaccine. No further details provided. The patient was having body aches, could not sleep, her mouth is really dry, her temp was 38.1 Celsius, her head feels weird, she has generalized weakness, pain at the injection site, and decreased appetite. She said that it was like having Covid again. She said that she had Covid back in Mar2020. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 38.1 centigrade.  The outcome of all the events was unknown. The events were reported as non-serious. Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag.  Instead, the suspected COVID likely represents a pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use.  Further information like confirmative COVID 19 Nucleic acid/ PCR test is needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After first vaccine i experienced fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea for 2 days and injection site pain for two weeks. After second Vaccine given at 9:55am. tingling of feet for about 20 mins, 30 mins after the vaccine. Two hours later fatigue, body aches, headache and nausea began. At 0030 1/12/2021 I woke up with severe chills and left chest pain, temp was 101.6 and heart rate was 160. I began to see black and chest pain was severe feeling like i was having a heart atack and was going to pass out so i called 911. I then began to get short of breath and got numbess on my legs, left arm and left side of neck. Chest pressure/pain radiated to left arm and neck. I was taken by the ambulance to hospital. Arrived around 0130. My heart rate sustained at 140s in the ER so I was admitted at 0530 am. My D Dimer was a bit elevated as well as my lactic so I was given a bolus of fluids plus maintenance. I had a CXR done, CTA chest(negative for PE), UA, Labs, entire cardiac workup including an ECHO during my admission. I also began to have loose stools and wrist joint pain. MY heart rate sustained at 125-147 for about 30 hours. Fevers on and off. After everthing was negative we determined this was secondary to the covid 19 vaccine. I was discharged 1/13/2021 at around 1:30 pm. My heart rate is still not at baseline which is 87-90. I&#39;m 100-130 and still get very fatigued with a simple slow walking. Still having tachycardia, fevers, body aches, joint wrist pain, chest discomfort and headaches. My potassium was 3.0 at discharge so will be needing labs in a week. Also bruised a little different than I usually do with lab draws so keeping an eye on them and will be checking my platelets again in a week. Ive been taking tylenol for my fever and pain and ativan for any anxiety when my heart rate goes up. (treatment during  hospital stay was normal saline bolus, nomal saline maintenance fluids at 150 cc/hr, tylenol, ativan, ice packs, rest)

First symptom was on 1/12 at 2000 when I had a headache and malaise so I went to bed early. Woke up at 0200 on 1/13 with nausea, body aches and chills. My temp felt fever-ish (100.4 via temporal scan). So I took Tylenol and Pepto to go back to sleep. Same symptoms carried throughout the morning of 1/13. By noon 1/13 = my L arm where the injection had occurred was swollen, painful and hard to move. That evening I had a presyncopal event where I felt flushed and nearly passed out. My L arm continued to hurt but the swelling moved down into my lymph nodes where lymphadenopathy continues to be a problem until now.

Horrible headache that did improve with tylenol and ibuprofen taken at the same time. Body shakes and can&#39;t control body temperature.  Felt freezing cold but skin was very hot to the touch (according to my husband). Then, I started sweating and felt really hot and couldn&#39;t cool down.  Felt nauseous but no vomiting.    Could not sleep but felt very tired.  Today is now 48 hours after vaccine and body aches are gone but I am still extremely fatigued.

                                                The night after receiving the vaccine (approximately 17 hours post-dose), I got up to use the restroom.  While washing my hands I became extremely dizzy, hot and nauseous.  While bending over to open the toilet (so that I could vomit) I ended up passing out.  I woke up on the floor of my bathroom (with my head against the wall), somewhat disoriented, shortly thereafter (exact timeframe that I was &#34;down&#34; is unknown).  I tried to get up and get back to bed but became extremely dizzy and hot again - this time bringing myself back down to the floor.  I laid there for an unknown amount of time before feeling like I could try to move again.  Once I felt a little better I crawled back to bed and laid down.  I believe I was out of bed for a total of 15-20 minutes.  I had no further dizzy/hot/nauseous episodes after that, however for the remainder of that day I felt exhausted, had a mild headache and felt like I couldn&#39;t get warm.  I did not take my temperature.  At about the 48-hr mark post-vaccination I was feeling back to normal other than a slight headache.

I experienced SOB; sharp and shooting pain throughout my extremities; dull body aches; nausea induced vomiting; dizziness; weakness.  I was unable to sleep throughout most of the night.  I used tylenol and ibuprofen for my symptoms which didnt seem to alleviate any of the symptoms during the night. Woke up on 01/15/2021 with a rash on my face.

A 36-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EJ1686), intramuscular (deltoid left) on 14Jan2021 18:25 at 0.3 mL, single for Covid-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took Bactrim and experienced allergy. The patient reported she did develop some side effects, but the hospital she received the vaccine at didn&#39;t know if it was an allergic reaction or what. She reported that a minute or two minutes after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine (14Jan2021), her heart rate became very fast, it went into like the 150&#39;s. She started feeling jittery, lightheaded, and she had some weakness of her lower extremities. She also felt nauseated. She didn&#39;t have any shortness of breath; she thinks she was okay there. She clarified that she had her mask on and they told her to remove her mask and to breathe, breathe, breathe. She had a pulse oximeter on, and her levels were always at 98, 96. She was told to sit still, and she was given water. Her heart rate went down to 76. She was fine and then after 5 minutes, she had the same reaction again. Her heart rate this time was in the 120&#39;s. She was lightheaded, cold, jittery. She did the same thing again and waited another 5- 10 minute. She felt better but was still nauseated, lightheaded, and really, really cold. She was kept there for 45 minutes. After that, she still did not feel 100%. Currently, she still does not feel 100% well. She was okay, she thinks she was okay. She explains they wanted to send her to the ER (emergency room) but she declined. Her heart rate had improved, she wasn&#39;t feeling like she was going to pass out. She wasn&#39;t experiencing shortness of breath, she wasn&#39;t throwing up, she didn&#39;t have a rash, her throat wasn&#39;t closing up, so she went back to work. She further stated that she came back home. Her heart rate was a little faster, but it wasn&#39;t as high as it had been. She still felt a little bit of weakness. At night (14Jan2021), she probably had a fever, she doesn&#39;t know. She was really thirsty and very hot. Because she was not feeling well, she didn&#39;t get up and drink anything. This morning (15Jan2021), she feels a little better. If she is doing her normal activities, she does get tired. She feels like she is running and is like &#34;okay I feel tired&#34;. She has a little bit of weakness in her lower extremities. She was given information for reporting side effects, but because she wasn&#39;t feeling well, she didn&#39;t do any of it. She checked her heart rate today (15Jan2021) and it&#39;s at 76. She added that when she moves a lot, she feels tired and she doesn&#39;t know why. She&#39;s normally a very active person. She is no longer jittery, but still feels lightheaded. She has a little bit of nausea. She felt hungry so she made a shake and it&#39;s not like she is going to throw up, but she is still feeling yucky. She still has a little weakness of her lower extremities. They feel light, she doesn&#39;t know how to explain it. She is just a little bit concerned because this is a new vaccine. The outcome of event heart rate increased was recovering; outcome of event feeling jittery was recovered on an unspecified date; while the outcome of other events was unknown. The patient confirmed he doesn&#39;t believe it to be life threatening. She doesn&#39;t know if this is a severe allergic reaction. She was reading on the side effects the COVID-19 vaccine can cause. Per reporter all events were related to suspect product.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the compatible time association, the contribution of suspect BNT162b2 to the event heart rate increased cannot be excluded.

This started 45 minutes after receiving the vaccine. About 1 1/2 hours symptoms still persisted so took 50mg of Benadryl and slept for 2 hours. Upon waking up facial flushing, dizziness, and pounding heart rate still present but was better. Continued to have left sided cluster headache and face flushing for 48 hours. Also was sore in my left arm down my left side to the bottom of my rib cage all the way up my left neck and sore into my left chest.

                                                Started with some nausea around noon on 1/18 that resolved, then experienced nausea without emesis and palpitations while driving to work at 1800. She describes it as feeling like her heart was racing, but also feeling like she was having large pauses in her heart rate in between the palpitation sensations. She drank a bottle of water and the feeling went away temporarily but it returned.  I am an employee, on arriving to work I noted increased shortness of breath which is unusual for me because I am an avid runner and very active. I noted the palpitations from around 1800-2000, including becoming dizzy and lightheaded during my shift which could endanger patient care, so I presented to the ED and was placed in the CCA. I had received both covid vaccines, second one on 1/11/21 and had about 20H malaise/fatigue and some expiratory wheezing which was abnormal for her but all has since resolved. I had intermittent heart palpitations and chest until 1/26

                                                On Saturday had nausea, vomiting started, and progressively lead to dizziness, shortness of breath, chest tightness, diarrhea, feeling of something stuck in her throat globus sensation, weakness.   She went to the ER on 1/18/21 they felt she had gastritis and gave her fluids, Zofran and COVID test which was negative, then they sent her home.  It continued where she could not eat, could not sleep, felt like she was going to die.  She ended up going back to the ER again on 1/23/21.  They did a CT scan, EKG, gave her IV fluids, flu and an antimotility agent for the nausea.   They did lab work to rule out other tests.  Did stool culture, blood work.  She got admitted over night, then she had endoscopy on 1/24/21 to rule out any issues with her throat since she felt like it was closing on her.  They said her esophagus looked fine, took biopsies.  All the tests that were done were negative, and sent her home on 1/24/21.  Then on Monday, 1/25/21 went to see a ENT specialist who also did a scope to loop down her throat to se if anything was blocked and felt that it was inflammation due to vomiting.  Advised to take Proton pump inhibitor to help with the acid reflux from the vomiting.  The GI doctor called on 1/26/21 showed some H-pylori, but did not know why she had that.  Was started on antibiotics for that.  She saw her PCP on 1/28/21, who did work up for celiac disease, thyroid scan/studies and all tests were negative as well.  Right now she is home and the plan is to wait it out and to see if she gets better over time.  She still having today 2/3/21 diarrhea, no appetite, cannot sleep, occasional chills, no fever, headache, chest tightness, nausea but is taking Zofran, still having the globus sensation in her throat.  States her &#34;body is not well&#34;, weakness as well.

She started to feel better and was transferred to the hospital, when she was in the hall of the hospital she started having difficulty breathing (wheezing) and difficulty swallowing so she received another dose of Epinephrine (EpiPen) and also Benadryl, Prednisone and Pepcid.

Per my husband. My eyes rolled back in my head, my body went limp, and I was moaning. I did not come to for 30-60 seconds despite shaking, calling my name, and sticking his finger in my throat. I came to and was alert and oriented but have no recollection of the incident. EMS was called.

The headache continued and soon some fatigue and tiredness accompanied it for 7-10 days following vaccination.  Then ten days after, I had an increase in symtpoms that included heightened fatigue, loss of appetite, feeling &#34;cold&#34;/ &#34;hot&#34; (no fever), and abdominal pain with nausea and some diarrhea.    Two weeks after vaccination, I had an increased of fatigue and not feeling well, accompained by a fever of (101.5 F) and chills, sore throat, and lethargy.  My symptoms of fever, chills, sore throat, body aches, congestion, and fatigue remained over the next few days and soon included chest pain and some increase work of breath.  With two negative Covid tests through work, it was recommended I go to see a physician, who instead sent me to Immediate Care.  There I had an EKG which showed sinus bradycardia and they sent me to ER due to my symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath.   At the ER, multiple tests were run to negative results.  ER Physician suspects that some of my struggles could be related to Covid vaccine but that I also may have caught an non-Covid virus on top of it which led to acute bronchitis.

                                                Received vaccine approx 4:25pm.  At approx 4:50pm, while driving home, I started to feel &#34;off&#34;, like something was wrong. Part of my tongue started to feel a bit tingly and itchy. I arrived home approx 5 minutes later, and took Diphenhydramine 50mg po. Parts of my tongue still felt tingly and itchy, and the right side towards the back was starting to feel a little swollen. I decided to have EMS bring me to the hospital in case I was having an allergic reaction. EMS arrived to my house at approx 5:15pm. My BP was significantly elevated (160&#39;s/90&#39;s - I am usually 110&#39;s/60&#39;s), and I was tachycardic at approx 100-105bpm (I am usually 70-80bpm). I had started to feel like the back of my throat was tightening a little bit. I did not have wheezing or severe difficulty breathing, or generalized itching, hives, or flushing. Once on the ambulance my throat was feeling tighter, so they administered Epinephrine 0.3mg IM,  inserted an IV, and administered Dexamethasone 10mg IV. After a few minutes the tightness in my throat was gone and I was feeling more back to normal.  BP and HR began to slowly trend down (BP 130&#39;s/80&#39;sjust prior to arrival to hospital). I was seen by Nursing and a Provider shortly after arrival to the ED.  My BP was still elevated (140&#39;s/90&#39;s) and HR was approx 90bpm. Provider stated that my posterior pharynx was not swollen. I was observed in the ED for approx 2.5 hours, and was discharged to home with instructions to take Diphenhydramine as needed and follow-up with my PCP within two days. BP and HR had normalized prior to discharge. They did not do any labs or tests (12-lead EKG was done by EMS en-route). The following day (today) I am tired and have a slight headache and occasional slight nausea but otherwise feel ok.

                                                lost consciousness; Severe cramping; diarrhea; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable other healthcare professional (patient). A 37-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) Solution for injection (lot number: EL3249, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the left arm on 13Jan2021 13:30 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history included chronic fatigue syndrome from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient has no known allergies. Patient is not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included cyanocobalamin (VITAMIN B-12), Iron, and Vitamin D (VITAMIN D NOS); patient received these medications within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to BNT162B2. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had not been tested for COVID-19. On 14Jan2021 04:00 AM, the patient experienced severe cramping, followed by episode of diarrhea. During the cramping, she lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time. No therapeutic measures were taken in response to the events. Outcome of the events at the time of last observation was recovering. The events were reported as non-serious.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A possible contribution role of the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) to the onset of lost consciousness cannot be excluded due to temporal relationship.  The case will be reassessed should additional information become available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

A 37-year-old female patient received the 1st dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, lot # EJ1685) at single dose at left arm on 02Jan2021 11:45 for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety. No allergies to medications, food, or other products. Patient was not pregnant at the time of vaccination. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. The patient has received no other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. On 03Jan2021 the patient has been tested for COVID-19 with rapid nasal swab test resulted positive. It was unknown if treatment was received. The outcome of events was unknown. Later the patient received the 2nd dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2, Lot # EL0140) at single dose at left arm on 23Jan2021 for covid-19 immunisation, administered at Pharmacy or drug store. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications in 2 weeks of this vaccination included: Lamictal, Klonopin, multivitamins, D, C, B, Zinc. On 24Jan2021 12:00 AM the patient experienced extreme tiredness, chills, fever, muscle aches, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, pale skin, malaise, night sweats. No treatment received for the adverse events. The outcome of events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: No effect of the suspect vaccine BNT162B2 could be reasonably achieved to protect from the targeted infection/disease due to the very short time lag. Instead, the positive COVID represents the pre-existing infection prior to vaccine use. Further information like confirmative COVID 19 nucleic acid/ PCR test together with any associated symptoms are needed for full medical assessment.

                                                After my second dose of the vaccine I had typical flu-like symptoms (fever 101.5, chills/shivering, body pain, headache, nausea) yet also developed acute and severe shortness of breath. My flu-like symptoms resolved within 48 hours yet my breathing difficulties continued and worsened. I was treated in the Emergency Department on 1/12, 1/19 and 1/20 (work up negative for covid, pulmonary embolism, infection, cardiac abnormalities). It feels as though I am having intractable diaphragm spasms that are forcing my exhales out at the end of my breath cycle. I have lost 10lbs and have been essentially incapacitated for 6 weeks. I have been evaluated by head and neck (no vocal cord dysfunction), speech pathology (no swallowing difficulties), pulmonology (no lung specific issues) and am awaiting a neurology consult.

Everything was seemingly going fine with my pregnancy until about 4 hours after receiving the vaccine when I went to the bathroom nd wiped and saw pink discharge on the toilet paper. I then began to have mild low abdominal cramping. The abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding steadily increased in severity over the next 24 hours until I eventually had an obvious miscarriage the evening of  12/31/2020.

                                                Woke up at 2:30 am feeling nauseous, broke out in cold sweat, got out of bed, went to restroom, everything went black and felt like I was going to pass out.  Husband got to me and laid on the floor.  Never passed out completely, but it was a very weird and odd feeling.  Felt better  after about 20 mins.  Have felt great since.  So did not go to primary care physician but felt the need to report.

                                                I awoke the next morning after my 2nd dose with the following side effects:  Extremely light headed to the point it was hard for me to walk without feeling like I would pass out, body aches, severe headache, nauseous but never vomited, extremely tired as if I were given a sleep aid, and weak.  I called my primary care physician to see if there was anything I could take to help, they advised me to take Ibuprofen and Tylenol. I started to feel better a few hours after taking Ibuprofen.  The next day I just had a headache and am feeling tired.  I would say the most extreme symptoms lasted about 10 hours and started to slowly feel better after that.

Saw a primary care physician on 1-18-21 and was found to have a raging yeast infection, bacterial vaginitis and urinary tract infection. I haven&#39;t had any of these in 15&#43; years. I was started on antibiotics. Next morning (1-19-21) felt extreme lower abdominal fullness and pressure and extreme nausea. I got in with my OBGYN at 9am same day and he discovered I had an ovarian cyst. He sent me down for an ultrasound and the results showed I had a ruptured ovarian cyst on my left side and an ovarian cyst on my right side. I have never had an ovarian cyst in my life. The next day (1-20-21) the right cyst ruptured. Having all three infections and two ovarian cysts (when I&#39;ve never had one before) lead my OBGYN and I to feel it warranted filing a VARES report

                                                nasty headache; felt hot; Shivers; achy; Nauseous; eyesight/ felt like she was straining; sensitivity to light; eyeballs felt sore; cold sweats; when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure; arm was hurting really bad; received the 2nd vaccine yesterday/ date of the first vaccine was 28Dec2020; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 38-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 14Jan2021 15:30 to 14Jan2021 15:45 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing pernicious anaemia, a B12 deficiency diagnosed 2-3 years ago (she gave herself B12 shots and she cannot convert B12 through her food), and myomectomy (15 cm uterine fibroid, removed this past summer). Concomitant medication included ongoing cyanocobalamin (B12) for pernicious anemia. The patient previously received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL1284, expiry date: 30Apr2021), intramuscularly on the left arm, deltoid on 28Dec2020 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; and a flu shot (the MA gave it in the back of her arm, it was pretty significant). The patient was a nurse and informed that she received the second COVID vaccine the day before report (14Jan2021). She woke up on the day of report on 15Jan2021 03:00 with a nasty headache, she felt hot, had the creepy crawly shivers, was achy and when she talked, she felt like she had to close her eyes because of pressure, and she was nauseous. She figured this was probably normal but she couldn&#39;t get a hold of her doctor and the hospital she worked at did not know what to tell her. She was wondering if she can take Tylenol or ibuprofen and has even thought about drinking caffeine, that it might help her headache. She didn&#39;t have a prescribing doctor as she got it at work. The first round of the vaccine she only had a super mild sore arm and a slight headache. She received the second vaccine at 3:30pm and then went to bed when she got home. She woke herself up at 3 am because her arm was hurting really bad. She started feeling like she couldn&#39;t keep her legs still. She felt hot, achy, and was shivering. She hasn&#39;t taken her temperature. When she woke up at 3 am she got on her phone, and her eyesight felt like she couldn&#39;t quite focus. It wasn&#39;t bad, but she felt like she was straining. Then her head started hurting at 5-7 am. She was very sensitive to light. She woke up and couldn&#39;t go back to sleep. She had cold sweats, and was shivering. Every time she stood up, she was chattering. She felt achy almost like growing pains. She woke up with the arm pain, and then 10-15 minutes later, she started feeling that creepy crawly feeling. She got up and the cool fan hit her, and she realized how bad she was shivering. The shivering intensified at times but hasn&#39;t gotten worse. She had just called employee health and realized that when her eyes were open when she was talking was when she felt nauseated. She has noticed the nausea in the past half hour. She did not know if it was related to the headache or what. She had to cover her eyes, her eyeballs felt sore. When she talked with her eyes open, she felt a little queasy. She was just straining to see. Her vision was not blurry but she can tell she was straining. She did not know if it was because of the headache and nausea. When she got out of bed, the cold fan did not feel cold but it made her shiver. She was a nurse was trying to be socially responsible as she did not want to get COVID. She was a little suspicious because of the headache after the first one. She hasn&#39;t been around anyone in a couple of weeks and had been working from home. She has not been exposed to people. She kept feeling like she needed to stretch because she was sore. The patient was tested for COVID pre-surgery (myomectomy) and was negative. She was also tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any. She was vaccinated at a hospital facility. Patient received no other vaccines on that day. The adverse events did not require any visit to the emergency room or physician office. Patient did not receive prior vaccines in the previous 4 weeks. Outcome of the events cold sweat and &#34;tested for COVID antibodies and she did not have any&#34; was unknown, nasty headache was reported as worsened (not recovered), and the remaining events was not recovered. The reporter considered the events serious due to medically significant events and related to the suspect drug.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the information currently available, a possible contributory role of BNT162B2 vaccine in the development of the events cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

Started out slowly late morning around 9am and got worse by the afternoon.  Took Motrin to relieve symptoms and slept.  The next day felt better but in the evening on 2/5/21 felt itchy starting from arms and neck.  Then after about 10 min of itchiness in that area and started itchiness down to my stomach and legs.  I took allergy medication prescribed by my physician: Cetirizine HCL 10mg tablet (1 tablet).  No issues after that. Had some issue with the itchiness from the first dose around the 3rd-5th day after the first vaccine was given.  Didn&#39;t take any allergy medications and had a tiny bit of dark circular spots on limps and torso but wasn&#39;t severe.  Thought that was from something I ate, or clothes detergent, etc. so shrugged it off.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I started to have a very mild headache. It felt like a pressure headache. I took Motrin. About 6 hours later that was gone. That night, about 8 hours after vaccine, I began to have muscle aches - whole body. I was very sore. I went to bed. Next day, I had severe joint and muscle aches and pains. The Motrin did not help that. Ice did not help, heat did not help and rest did not help. No headache. I wasn&#39;t red in face etc. Over the next week, I the muscle aches and joint aches were varying between moderate to severe. Some days it did restrict my activity completely. It started to get better week two - but still moderate to severe. I had some abdominal pain on upper left side and my right side (upper, as well) The upper right side pain would go away with ice but the upper left side wasn&#39;t helped with that. The only thing in those two weeks that helped was Celebrex (Motrin stopped helping). After two weeks - around 2/5/2021, I saw my Dr - a virtual visit. He told me to double up on the dose of Celebrex to help with muscle aches, joint aches and right side abdominal pain. Heart palpitations - irregular heartbeat. On 2/7/2021, I took a test for COVID and it was negative.  The joint and muscle aches were moderate to mild the third week. There was no more abdominal pain in third week. Week 4 - mild joint and muscle aches - only a few days that week and that was it. Last week was the first week where I had a few days that were fine. And this week, I have been completely fine. Had general malaise for three weeks solid. And now it&#39;s gone.

                                                Within 30 minutes, I turned bright red - my face and my forearms. Not a rash or raised rash. It was a deep red flushing. I took a dose of oral Benadryl it didn&#39;t go away. It felt like a sunburn.  I had a headache starting at the back of my head. 1st and second day, I had pain in my joints. Not muscular pain. It came and went the joint pain - behind my left knee was hurting really bad and then it went away. Then my right wrist would start hurting and then it would go away, etc. The second day, the headache was more mild - like a mild pressure in my head. The redness was still there - the red face and red arms. My left arm at the site was cherry red and about the size of two inch circle and somewhat raised. The third day, my headache was worse. It was not like a normal headache but an overall pressure in head. Pink and a bit larger but didn&#39;t  hurt as  bad on arm- the redness continued for six days on my face. The headache lasted 14 days straight - Motrin, ice, heat and extra sleep was tried for treatment. On 15th day it started to let up. On 16th day, it was very mild headache. On the 17th day, it was a full blown headache again. Day 18 it was gone. On the second week, I had mild pain in my stomach and then that went away. On day 3, I had about an hour - twice that day - where I was short of breath and then it went away - it was just that day - about noon and at night. I took Benadryl and when I woke up that didn&#39;t  happen again. Doctor called on day 12 - when my headaches weren&#39;t going away. He took some labs. My labs were normal except thyroid (and I already have a condition for my thyroid). Dr. gave me a medication for headache but I didn&#39;t take it - it had a possibility of making me tired and I didn&#39;t want to take it.

                                                I received the COVID vaccine on Monday Dec. 21, 2020 at 14:30.  By 17:00 I was not feeling well.  I was tired, had a headache, muscle aches, nausea and a fever of 101 F.   The headache, low grade fever and significant malaise continued through Tues Dec 22 and Wed Dec 23.   On Thursday morning Dec 24 at 2:30 AM, I woke from sleep with the urge to use the bathroom.   I suddenly felt light-headed and dizzy and had a diaphoresis that soaked my hair and PJs.   Fortunately my husband who is a nurse anesthetist helped me through the episode safely and was able to get me back to bed.   I am not sure if that event was related to the vaccine or if I happened to be a little dehydrated and had a vaso-vagal event.  I did not take any medications because I was allowing my body to have a natural response to the vaccine.

                                                Administration of vaccine was given about 3 inches too low, not sure if it went into muscle or subcutaneous but I did end up with an injection site reaction 2 days later to include a 2x3 inch red, itchy, raised, hot to the touch welt.  Also had extreme dizziness, nausea, headache 2 days after injection.  Dizziness, nausea, headache subsided after 24hrs however injection site reaction will go away and come back randomly.  Seems to coincide with getting sick?  Was fine up until 12/29 when I did end up getting sick to include headache, body aches, chills.  I went to go get covid tested which was negative.  I ultimately had a sinus/ear infection.  However injection site reaction had gone away UNTIL I got sick on 12/29 then it showed up again and still have it as of today.

I vomited about 6 times that day and had diarrhea. Next morning, my face was flushed. I had a low grade fever of 99.5, and checked my BP. On my home machine, my pulse was 135. I decided to go to the hospital. My Apple Watch measured my heart rate to be 150 at one time. At the ER, I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia and dehydration. I was placed on oxygen as my levels were between 90-93, and I was given IV fluids. I have felt fatigued since then, some nausea, and mild diarrhea still.

I felt ok the following day and was doing laundry around 6 pm and my arm stopped being sore and I got really dizzy and nauseated and my vision had shadows (reminded me of an ocular migraine) and drank 2 x 16 oz glasses of water and laid down and felt better in about 20-30 minutes.

That lasted through 1/8. On 1/7 I started having trouble with taking a deep breath. Chest would get very tight and hurt when I would take a big breath, bend forward, or lay back.  I went to express care and they could not rule out pericarditis. Told me to go to the Emergency Room for further work up to rule out spontaneous PE or pericarditis.

A 39-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number EL3246/expiration date unknown), dose number 1, via an unspecified route of administration on 02Jan2021 10:30 at a single dose on the left arm for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. Concomitant medications included alprazolam (XANAX). The patient experienced arm pain and headache 4 hours post injection requiring Excedrin. At bedtime, neck stiffness began and worsened. She was treated with lidocaine patches and Aleve. She developed diarrhea 33 hours post injection. She went ER because she was dehydrated. She developed UTI very quickly by hour 35 post injection. She had puffy face and eyes, and burning inside her digestive tract. She was treated with Benedryl at home for allergic reaction, Toradol for pain, IV fluids for dehydration and Keflex for infection. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior vaccination and was not tested for COVID-19 since vaccination. The outcome of the events was recovering.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Dehydration cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

I didn&#39;t have any other symptoms during my 15 min observation period, but when I got to my car to leave the hospital, I had another episode of dizziness that lasted a couple minutes and then stopped. I didn&#39;t have any other incidents of dizziness, but started feeling fatigued and had chills that afternoon. Tuesday evening I had a slight fever, diarrhea, tachycardia, and palpitations. Over night I developed body aches.  Most of the symptoms were pretty much gone within 24 hrs, but the fatigue and tachycardia lasted into Friday. My heart rate was consistently 115-125 bpm from Tuesday evening through Friday.

                                                1 week after receiving the first dose, in the afternoon i had loose stool followed by some mild abdominal cramping for the rest of the day. I took some ibuprofen. The following morning (Wednesday), the pain was on my right abdomen and right flank area only.  It was persistent, achy, soreness.  My insides felt very tender to put any pressure on my right abdomen or flank. The pain on the right side of my back became more intense as the day went on. I had sharp right flank pain when lifting my right leg after showering to get dressing and use lotion. When I was walking up the stairs I turned to the left and had a sharp pain in the right flank again, taking my breath away for a moment.  Around 4pm I took ibuprofen.  About an hour later my eyes felt hot and tired. My cheeks were pink.  My temp was 99.2.  I generally just didn&#39;t feel good from this achiness. I took Benadryl and went to bed at 7pm, and slept for about 12 hours, waking once at midnight. The following day (Thursday) I felt 99% better and contacted my doctors office.  When putting pressure on the same areas I could feel very slight tenderness if I pushed hard. That evening and into the next morning (Friday) I was mildly achy on my right side but barely at all. I didn&#39;t feel any more discomfort until this past week on the 22nd or 23rd.  During sexual intercourse I felt that same mild internal tenderness on my right side. At this time, I don&#39;t believe I have any pain. My urine seems unusually clear, light colored, and smaller volume but this is very subjective. I have some abdominal swelling but this has been present since my breast reconstruction in January of 2020 and seems to get worse or better depending on the days activities or meals so it&#39;s hard to know what causes what.  Labs were done on 1/22 showing decreased kidney fuction. Pending tests include an ultrasound of the Right Ovary that remains after the hysterectomy, bladder, and kidney. In addition to a 24 hour urine and some other urine studies.

My boss came to help walk me outside because I didn?t even feel like it was me walking. I don?t remember walking out of work.  I was there but ?not there?. I was not myself. I didn?t feel like i was in my body. I had to have my husband come get me from work, I slept most the rest of the day and night. Now I?m on day 2 and my joints still ache, my head hurts so bad, I am so tired I either am asleep on the couch or in bed. I have no energy. It takes everything I have to move just to go to the bathroom.

This lasted for 1.5 hrs. then I laid down.  As I was falling asleep I couldn&#39;t shake a scary &#34;vision: I was having of myself like my eyes turning bright blue and electricity going through my body and my body ascending into the air.  I had nightmares all night.  I have never had hallucinations or whatever that was.  And nightmares are rare for me.  I woke up fine on day 2, just a stiff sore arm.  Day 3 I was fine.  Day 4 I am developing an itchy, bumpy, rash on my right arm at site of injection and around it.  I reported this online on my health chart and will go in if I keep getting strange reactions.

Next day (1) slight cheek numbness noted- resolved Day3 . Day 2 slight difficulty articulating words. Night 3 intermittent sharp outer ear and mastoid area pain duration 30min and at different times intermittent pulsatile heartbeat and whistling sound 10 min or less.  Day 4 &amp; 6 notable improvements in cheek ability to puff- not fully resolved though. Day 5 eyelid movement - not fully resolved though.  Day 6: less difficulty articulating. Day 1: Spoke to OB office nurse- offered steroids which I declined &amp; spoke to PCP recommended go to ED, which I declined, I&#39;m a family physician and had otherwise normal Cranial nerve testing and no other neurological changes- seems fully consistent with Bell&#39;s palsy.

She did not experience any respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestation. She completely recovered in Jan2021.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on available information, a possible contributory role of the subject product, BNT162B2 vaccine, cannot be excluded for the reported event of anaphylactic reaction  due to temporal relationship.   There is limited information provided in this report.  Additional information is needed to better assess the case, including complete medical history, diagnostics, counteractive treatment measures and concomitant medications.  This case will be reassessed once additional information is available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                The patient was admitted to the hospital on February 10, 2021 for evaluation of jaundice.  This is a healthcare worker (direct patient care) and she received the first dose of Covid 19 vaccine in January 13 2021, then subsequently developed some abnormalities of the liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia.  Because of this, her second vaccine was held.  She also subsequently noticed scleral jaundice.   She reports that it was 5 days since the COVID-19 vaccine on January 13 when she developed a rash which was present in the legs anterior abdomen and arms.  Then 8 days after the vaccine, she developed a different rash on top of the original which was less petechial and more maculopapular.   The rash is pruriginous, its been intermittently worsening and improving.   She had no fever associated with the rash, although she reports that the day before admission February 9, she had some chills and sweats. She had some mild abdominal pain and cramps.  No prior history of hepatitis.  She also developed a petechial rash predominantly in the lower extremities.  Results of ancillary studies showed that her AST is currently (02/12/21) 196 ALT of 61, her bilirubin total was 7.9 with a direct of 5.5, and on admission her AST was 183 ALT 40, with a total bilirubin of 14.  Her platelet count on admission was 111, currently is 93.  She has some mild microcytic anemia and no leukopenia and in the differential she has increased monocytosis.  Her viral hepatitis serology panel shows hepatitis a IgM that is negative hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody negative, hepatitis B surface antibody positive consistent with previous vaccination, and hepatitis C antibody negative. COVID-19 antigen was negative on admission 2/10/2021 she reports that she had a Covid PCR done in her office 5 days or so before admission that was also negative. She has been seen by our GI who evaluated her liver abnormalities.  Imaging studies including a CT scan of 2/10/2021 showed chronic changes in the colon that could be consistent with inflammatory process such as ulcerative colitis, and a diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of the liver with nodularity that could be consistent with cirrhosis.  She has a splenic varices and gastric varices which would make the diagnosis of cirrhosis certainly possible.  An MRI of her abdomen on 2/11/2021 shows confirmation of the cirrhotic changes in the liver biliary dilatation or gallbladder abnormalities.  There is evidence of portal hypertension. He also had a liver ultrasound that shows findings consistent with possible cirrhosis, including splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and GB sludge. Alpha 1 antitrypsin, LKM antimitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative.  ANA and ANCA are pending.  CMV and EBV PCR are pending. Given the unclear underlying etiology of her liver abnormalities, she had a liver biopsy. Result-Suggestive of NASH and confirms F4 cirrhosis. The patient was a started on Cipro and Flagyl empirically because of the findings on the colon suggestive of possible cholangitis.  She has normal renal function.  She has had no tick bites, no exposure to animals, no external factors consistent with atopic dermatitis or allergic type of rash.    She reports that before admission, she had normal platelets about 1 or 2 years ago when she was tested, as well as normal liver function test.  She reports that she has had some mild epistaxis as well as bleeding from her lips.  She has some anorexia, she has had some looser stools but has been clear without obvious blood and she has had no hematuria. EGD on 15FEB2021- mild portal hypertensive gastropathy. Low risk esophageal varices. Labwork 15FEB2021- AST 173/ALT 64/Alk Phos 235/Plt 109/ Discharged on 02/15/2021 to home with plans for follow-up with GI and PCP.  Prescribed Prednisone with taper off after 28 days. Follow-up appointment has not yet occurred as of the day this report is submitted(2/19/2021).

A 39-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Lot number: EJ1685; Expiration date was not reported) on 22Dec2020 (12:30) at a single dose on the left deltoid, with route of administration unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization at the hospital. Medical history included allergy to lobster, and had used steroids. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. On 24Dec2020, the patient had something stuck in the throat; and had nausea. The patient had an emergency room visit due to the reported events; and had received a three-day course of oral prednisone and antihistamine, and then diphenhydramine (BENADRYL). The patient had no respiratory, cardiovascular, dermatological or gastrointestinal manifestations. The outcome of the events, &#39;something stuck in the throat&#39; and &#39;nausea&#39;, was recovered on an unspecified date. The reporter had considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the events were related to the suspect vaccine.

A 39-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EM9810), via an unspecified route of administration on 09Feb2021 18:10 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history. She was healthy and takes no medications. The patient got the vaccine Tuesday night at 6:10 PM. She waited in the parking lot where she got it, which was through (School Name). She had a severe reaction and had to receive an Epi Pen. This reaction occurred maybe 10 minutes after she got it. She had not left the parking lot yet, so it was prior to the 15 minutes. She broke out in a rash, her chest felt really heavy like someone was sitting on it, like an elephant, and her throat felt like it was on fire which is what is started as, then it went to her ears. From there, it escalated. She had gotten out of her car and took her sweatshirt off, she thought she was just hot. As soon as she got back in the car and as soon as she got in she started convulsing uncontrollably and shaking uncontrollably. Two ladies she works with had parked next two her on both sides and they noticed this and went to get the emergency squad. She did not lose consciousness. She could still hear everything but her arms and legs were shaking, and her right leg was shaking and stuck. The emergency squad had to help her out of the car. The ambulance gave her an Epi Pen injection and the squad took her to the hospital. Her speech was slurred, she could not communicate. She was stuttering the same thing over and over. She had a CAT scan with contrast and the stroke team decided she needed TPA - the stoke medication. They administered that and admitted her to the hospital Tuesday night. Wednesday she had an MRI, echocardiogram and another CAT scan and they released her to come home last night. She is still having lingering effects. Her speech is back. Her arm movement is back. The reason they treated her as a stroke patient, they said, is because when they told her to stick her tongue out, she had dysphagia - her tongue was falling to the side, and her smile was droopy on the right side. Her right arm- she would try to move it but it would not go. And her right leg too. She could do everything on her left side and nothing on her right side. She was conscious and could hear but could not get anything to work. After receiving the TPA, Wednesday when she woke up, she was being checked on every 30 minutes throughout the night, she was able to speak and communicate. She will still stutter and have slow words but it is way better and she can communicate. Her right arm is able to move and she can use it but her fine motor is hard. Like writing stuff is a challenge. She also has a walker. Her right leg is almost paralyzed, it drags beside her as she walks. She can move but has to really concentrate to get going. She has not reached out to her doctor yet. She was admitted to the hospital and had a bunch of tests done. The Epi Pen gave her stroke like symptoms. They were not sure in the hospital if it was actually a stroke based on her 2 MRI&#39;s and CAT scans. It did not look like a stroke from those but they think that the Epi Pen and the stress it puts into your body made her body shut down. Which the Epi Pen they said can cause stroke like symptoms. They were unsure as they have seen multiple things with the vaccine come in over the last few weeks. They told her she would need to work on the therapies out-patient. She will have to have PT/OT for lingering effects she was suffering from. Outcome of events was recovered with sequelae.

                                                Contractions and abdominal pain starting three days after receiving second dose of vaccine. Admitted to the hospital with contractions. Healthy pregnancy with no issues prior to vaccine.; Contractions and abdominal pain starting three days after receiving second dose of vaccine. Admitted to the hospital with contractions. Healthy pregnancy with no issues prior to vaccine.; Contractions and abdominal pain starting three days after receiving second dose of vaccine; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 39-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) at the age of 39-year-old, via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm right on 24Feb2021 (lot number: EN0200, expiry date not reported) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. The patient&#39;s medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s last menstrual period was on 05Sep2020. The patient was 25 weeks pregnant and is due on 12Jun2021. The patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248) at the age of 39-year-old, intramuscular on the left arm on 03Feb2021 08:30 for covid-19 immunisation. The patient experienced contractions and abdominal pain starting three days after receiving second dose of vaccine on 27Feb2021. The patient was admitted to the hospital with contractions.

Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events which included treatment with Procardia 10 mg, every 6 hrs, by mouth; Betamethasone steroid injections. The patient was recovering from the events.; Sender&#39;s Comments: The maternal exposure during pregnancy and associated events of contractions and abdominal pain were possibly related to the second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE).  However, contractions and abdominal pain were very common events. The patient experienced contractions and abdominal pain starting three days after receiving second dose of vaccine, therefore, there maybe other factors which may have impacted the occurrence of the events.

A 39-year-old non-pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Formulation: Solution for injection, Batch/lot number and Expiration date was unknown), first dose via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date, second dose via intramuscularly in right arm on 16Jan2021 15:30; both at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation in workplace clinic. The patient&#39;s medical history included depression, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase), latex allergy. Concomitant medications included venlafaxine, L-methylfolate; the patient received both the drugs within 2 weeks of vaccination. The patient previously took fluoxetine, citalopram and experienced known allergies for both the drugs. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination. The patient has been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination. The patient experienced debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension on 25Jan2021 06:00. On 01Feb2021, the patient underwent lab test and procedure included nasal swab/ COVID-19 by PCR: Negative. The adverse events resulted in doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The patient was treated with IV Dexamethazone, Diphenhydramine, ketorolac, promethazine for all the events. The outcome of the events was not recovered.  Information on the Lot/Batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: On the basis of the available information, the reported events debilitating headache, nausea, vomiting, ringing in the ears, L eye drooping, numbness and tingling of lips, trembling of R side of body, abnormal/change in gait, change in vision, hypertension would seem most likely related to intercurrent and/or underlying medical condition and concomitant medication, which is not related to bnt162b2. This case will be reassessed when additional information becomes available.
