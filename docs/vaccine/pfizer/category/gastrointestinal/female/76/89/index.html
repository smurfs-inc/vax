A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 29Jan2021 14:00 at a single dose to prevent getting COVID-19. Medical history included cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis, medications for her heart, and medication for her stomach. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for high blood pressure and atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient has been on amlodipine in a good while, 7-8 years and atorvastatin for 5 years. The patient had the COVID shot on Friday, 29Jan2021 at 14:00, and about 4 hours afterward, she had a bad experience. She became very nauseated and lost her sight for 5 minutes. Everything was grey. She was wondering if there is anything she can take afterward. She was scheduled for her next one on 19Feb2021. She was wondering if she will experience the same thing. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. After getting the vaccine, she was on her way back. She began to feel very nauseated in the car. Then, all the sudden she wanted to throw up, but couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t hear her niece or say anything to her. She clarified she could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away. She couldn&#39;t respond. She rolled the window down to get air in her face. She hadn&#39;t eaten. In about 25-30 minutes got better. Since then, she hasn&#39;t been eating like she should, so she was still a little nauseated. It has improved though. She got the vaccine in her left arm.  Her right arm is mostly metal. She decided to get it because she is over 70 and wanted to prevent getting COVID-19. It was also reported that she was also on an arthritis medication, medications for her heart and a medication for her stomach. She has had no problems with those medications though. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: lost on an unspecified date. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. The outcome of the events &#34;lost eye sight for 5 minutes, everything was grey&#34;, &#34;could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away&#34; and &#34;very nauseated/wanted to throw up but couldn&#39;t&#34; was recovered on 29Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.

                                                DEATH-My Mother received her second Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, February 18, 2021 and died three days later on Sunday, February 21, 2021, after being admitted to the intensive care unit at  Hospital.  After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.  Instead of the massive all call for vaccinations, we need further information and data from additional studies that will give more insight as to when the vaccine can cause more harm than good, as in My Mother?s case.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

                                                LTC Pharmacy was notified of a potential vaccine related hospital admission on 3/8/2021. The following information was gathered from discussion with RPH at Hospital. The patient received second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/26/2021. The patient then had nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. On 2/27/2021, the patient went to the bathroom and while on the toilet, had a vasovagal event which led to her hitting the side of the face while falling.

                                                Started getting headache within minutes of shot.   Bad body aches for about 12 hours.   Everything ached and couldn&#39;t get comfortable to sit, stand, lay down.  Stomach cramps that doubled me over lasted for a few hours.    Last 4 hours could barely walk.   Husband had to help walk me to the bathroom.  Chills and shaking and could not warm up after the 1st hour through the rest of the night! Everything started going away about 1:00 in the afternoon and felt better at 2:00.

She stated that she needed some help because she is so sick. She was suggested to call again calling Pfizer medical information department. She stated that she had called back three times, but there is no such number.

This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 02Feb2021 12:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, knee surgery, and bulging disc.  The patient had an MRI on an unspecified date in Jan2021 (a week and a half prior to the date of initial report) with result of bulging disc. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate (ARNUITY ELLIPTA) for asthma; She was supposed to take 1 puff a day. However, being in the house, she had no problems, she had maybe used it twice a week since she hasn&#39;t had any problems, she last took 1 puff on 01Feb2021). She was also taking vitamin pills concomitantly. On 04Feb2021 23:00, 2 days after the vaccine, the patient had sweats, was wringing wet, and was not feeling well. Her hair was wet, and she was sweating. She was okay on the morning of 05Feb2021 but not herself. She had a little nausea on 05Feb2021. She was just not quite herself on 05Feb2021 but doesn&#39;t have the sweats. She further reported that she had her first shot on 02Feb2021 12:00. She was fine and had no problems.

                                                Day after receiving the vaccine, the patient complained of abdominal pain which worsened over the day.  She went to the ED and was hospitalized.  Abdominal pain complaints increased and continued, she decompensated rapidly, was intubated and subsequently died 3 days later.  Imaging results showed, progressive ovarian cancer in the bowels.  Blood culture revealed that she had E.Coli in her blood.  It is thought that this is NOT related to the vaccine.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included stroke 14 years ago.  Concomitant medication included warfarin. The patient was lightheaded, did not have an appetite and experienced weakness on Jan2021. She was even nauseated and threw up earlier on Jan2021. She wanted to know what can she do.  She had nauseousness and vomiting. She vomited one time but she was not currently vomiting and just took some Ginger ale to settle her stomach. Patient was asking what to drink or does she take any Tylenol or let it. Outcome of the events was unknown. The date of second dose was 16Feb2021  Information about batch/lot number has been requested.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

An 83-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection), intramuscular on Left deltoid (upper left arm) on 13Jan2021 14:00 at single dose to prevent COVID. Medical history included sulfa drug reaction, high blood pressure diagnosed in 1970s or 1980s (States she was in the hospital in the 70s or 80s. She has high blood pressure which has been difficult to control, she is seeing a cardiologist and he is content with her blood pressure readings, her diastolic is normal), incontinence, thyroid nodule surgery a year ago (2020), thyroid nodule, ten operations in the last 3 years, tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery, scratchy throat problems since a week prior to getting the vaccine (from Jan2021) and post nasal drip and she has had that for years and when they operated nothing worked. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took cipro where she could not breathe. She does not have lot, ndc or expiration date to provide for any of the medications mentioned that she had a reaction to. She took the Asiatic flu shot in 1958 (as reported), she had a reaction and high fever, weak and pale. This occurred when she was 19 years old. She took the Pfizer covid 19 shot last Wednesday. She stated that it could be her but she got a few of the reported side effects. What she found most important was that she had swollen lips that started about an hour after receiving the vaccine. Last night (13Jan2021) she got the chills and was shaking during the night. She had mild chills in the last few days, during the night she was shaking from the chills but it may have been cold at night, reporting the chills have subsided but she can feel it a little bit. In Jan2021, she felt a burning sensation in her left arm which lasted about two minutes. She got a piercing earache in her left ear for about two minutes and then it went away. She experienced nausea within two minutes, but she ate the ginger candy she had in her purse and her nausea went away. She could have something else too since she has a red dot on the inside of her throat. She did not see it was red before last night (13Jan2021). She took Benadryl on Wednesday afternoon after she called the doctor&#39;s office, she took the Benadryl thinking it was an allergic reaction, her swollen lips seemed like it was improved but now it was minor. She has had the tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery but she felt the tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, it is sort of still ongoing but states it has sort of improved. Patient also mentioned swelling on left side where the nodule was removed. She was asking if she should get the second dose. She has an appointment for her second dose. She has never had much problems till she was 80. Her husband tested negative for covid and she tested negative in Aug2020 prior to one of her surgeries. Patient stated that she is 83 but she is biologically younger. She felt pretty good normally. The events did not require emergency room visit or physician office visit.

An 83-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: TL9261, expiration date not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 16:30 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient has no medical history and there were no concomitant medications. On 25Jan2021, the patient experienced having acid reflux, pain in her chest/stomach that lasted all night last night and was worse when lying down. When she burped, it relieved some pressure. She had strange visions flashing in her head while trying to sleep on 25Jan2021. The patient was wondering if she was having a reaction from the vaccine. On 25Jan2021, after over an hour after the vaccine, she started having severe pain in the chest and stomach area and she couldn&#39;t sleep last night at all. She was awake all night, burping up acid. She was wondering if those were reaction to the vaccine, should she go see her doctor or what should she do about that. She got her first dose on 25Jan2021 and she started having chest and stomach pain the same day at about 6 PM. She was burping acid all night and early in the morning of 26Jan2021 and she was having these strange things like pictures going to her head that were weird. She was not sleeping but they were strange images, they were strange, they weren&#39;t normal. She says with that added in it sounds crazy. She has her vaccine card that says she should get the next one 15Feb2021. She wanted to avoid catching the corona. She had drank acid yesterday and she was wondering if that was causing her to have acid reflux. She clarified that she drank a lot of acidic liquids on 25Jan2021 and she was wondering if that might have had something to do with it, like orange juice and cranberry juice so she is wondering did that have anything to do with it, the acidity maybe made her stomach have acid reflux because she has had that in the past. She asked if she should go to the doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

Familial history included all of her family that has passed, died of diabetes or cancer. Concomitant medications included unspecified other blood pressure medication and nifedipine for blood pressure. The patient did not receive other vaccination within 4 weeks. The patient reported that she took the shot on 29Jan2021 and she stayed for the 15 minutes, but she didn&#39;t have any feeling about it.

Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.  Patient also had a urinalysis performed which shows negative for leukocytes, nitrate negative.  Patient was admitted to medical inpatient as it is deemed that she will need longer than a 2 midnight stay for cardiac monitoring and will work with physical therapy and occupational therapy for gait training and strengthening with relation to the compression fracture of her L2 fracture, and pain control.

                                                Resident was monitored for 20 min period post vaccine and had no complaints until the 20 minute period had just finished and she had a sudden onset of abdominal pain/epigastric pain that last about 45-60 minutes. She was unable to eat anything and needed to be helped back into bed. Her vital signs were stable (blood pressure slightly elevated) and she has had no complaints or issues since. I do not believe the resident had a bowel movement to coincide with her pain.

An 85-year-old female patient started received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm, on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was received on 11Jan2021 (lot number: EL0142) Medical history included GERD. Concomitant medication included pantoprazole and other unspecified product. Patient got the first shot of the COVID vaccine three weeks ago, and she didn&#39;t know anything had happened to her. She got the second dose of the vaccine yesterday at noon, and she was fine, although she didn&#39;t sleep very well on 01Feb2021. But the morning of 02Feb2020, she went in the kitchen and dropped some blueberries because the plastic boxes don&#39;t close easily, and she bent over to pick the blueberries up and she got dizzy. She did not know why she should get suddenly dizzy, and her stomach seemed a little upset, but she has no fever on 02Feb2021. Patient was just wondering if the dizziness is a side effect of the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine and stated when she had the incident where she bent over and was dizzy, it felt just really terrible, but she was feeling fine now, but the incident did shake her up a bit. Outcome of the events was unknown.

After the vaccine, she had no new symptoms or signs of vaccine reaction and MD friend reports that he checked her pulse which was not elevated from baseline. On 1/16,  she awakened and continued to feel at her recent baseline. However, in the early afternoon, she complained of  headache, nausea/epigastric pain, and chest heaviness. These apparently were not unusual symptoms for her to feel intermittently.  Per her niece, who has a home O2 sat device, her 02 sat that morning was 97 with a HR of 87 irregularly irregular. She was afebrile. (continue on page 2)

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 87-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included leg problem, it&#39;s severe pain in the right leg in the back; very bad nerves. Concomitant medication included oxycodone hydrochloride, paracetamol (PERCOCET [OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE;PARACETAMOL]) for pain in her right leg.

Caller stated that she had the injection on Monday (18Jan2021) at fair grounds, its the Covid Vaccine. She didn&#39;t feel good the day she got it on Monday. Then Tuesday she felt good. Wednesday (20Jan2021) she was sick again, and having pains in the stomach, well she can&#39;t say stomach, but also towards the afternoon around 2&#39;o clock, she got light headed and dizzy, she felt like she was about to pass out (21Jan2021), and she thought to herself she had to hurry and get something to eat and that feeling last 4-5 hours. She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects. While on the phone with this call handler, caller states that she was starting to get dizzy again but she just had breakfast.

On 21Jan2021 Thursday she felt dizzy, like she was going to pass out. On 22Jan2021 Friday she was feeling dizzy again, and her stomach was acting up and she was weak again. Caller was dizzy and weak. The dizziness was a different each time, sometimes she has got it, sometimes she didn&#39;t, its intermittent, she would be doing something and then she needed to grab a hold of something when the dizziness come on. Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy. When attempting to get the product details, caller states that she was getting old, she provided EL3248, she needed light to read it. The card did have an Expiry date but she can&#39;t read it, it&#39;s 20 something, she just can&#39;t read. She was on nothing new.

On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday. She had No results to share but she had a X ray a couple weeks ago (Jan2021), and that would lead up to MRI she was going to have. Caller stated that she had very bad nerves, her husband passed away 2 years ago and she hasn&#39;t overcome that, she lived by her-self, and was wondering if some of this stress, would lead to the symptoms she was having right now. She wanted to know if these are normal side effects and if it safe to have the second dose. Caller stated that she was slow and old.
