                                                Patient was observed for 15 minutes after the vaccination administration, felt fine, and left the facility with her husband.  The 2 of them drove 2 blocks away to a restaurant to eat.  Midway through her meal, she reported that she started to feel &#34;funny&#34; like she was &#34;drunk&#34; or something, and felt nausea and hot/sweaty.  Her husband got her in the vehicle and drove to the vaccination facility,  When he arrived, she was obtunded and &#34;out of it.&#34;  No respiratory distress, No noted rash, but some clamminess/diaphoresis.  She was initially examined by FNP and cursory limited neuro exam while patient was seated did not reveal any gross motor deficits.  FNP called 911 and staff called for me.  When I arrived, patient was groggy, but responsive.  She was A&amp;O x3 and in no distress. Pulse 54, strong and regular (normal rate for her per patient--on a Beta blocker).  BP 120/74.  O2 sat 97% on outdoor cold air.  Patient was able to move all extremities equally and with equal strength.  Lungs CTA, Heart regular no murmur, abdomen soft.  Patient complained of continued malaise/grogginess and nausea, no vomiting.  EMS arrived, checked glucose, which was &#34;normal&#34; (I didn&#39;t hear the result) and patient declined transport.  I discussed ER evaluation vs. continued monitoring by me.  Patient and husband requested monitoring.  Patient stayed in the vehicle with her husband, I gave the husband my phone number to call if any worsening.  I checked on her 5 minutes later, then 10 minutes after that.  By that time, her adult daughter had arrived.  We again discussed continue family monitoring  vs. ER.  The family wanted to take the patient home to monitor.  Patient stated &#34;If I could just go to bed, I think I will be fine.&#34;  I called to check on the patient at 6p.  She had rested well and was improved.  She still felt a bit groggy, but otherwise was feeling better.  I called to check on the patient 1/29 at noon.  At that point, husband stated that she was &#34;back to normal. Symptoms and signs appeared to be consistent with a vasovagal response.  I suspected symptoms may have been prolonged by her Beta blocker

A 76-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: ELI283, expiry date unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the right arm, on 11Jan2021, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient reported she had her first vaccine on 11Jan2021. On 19Jan2021, the patient was feeling really bad, had a bad headache, general malaise and was feeling sick and nauseated. She was not feeling well and has not been feeling well the last 3 days. She thought the side effect would be right after getting the vaccine however hers started on 19Jan2021 (2 days ago). She stated she had an awful headache which she still has and had nausea. She wanted to know if it was normal to have happened this far away from receiving the vaccine, this amount of time from the vaccine. The patient reported that she is not quite as bad now, but she still feels it. The patient was worried it will not go away (Jan2021). The patient became frustrated and stated that she was just trying to find out if what she was feeling was normal. The patient also thought she had COVID and took a test in Jan2021 but she did not have COVID (negative). The outcome of the events &#34;not feeling well/general malaise/feeling sick&#34;, &#34;feeling really bad&#34;, &#34;a bad headache&#34; and &#34;feeling sick and nauseated/nausea&#34; was recovering; and the outcome of &#34;worried it will not go away&#34; and &#34;frustrated&#34; was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration at the left arm on 29Jan2021 14:00 at a single dose to prevent getting COVID-19. Medical history included cholesterol, high blood pressure, arthritis, medications for her heart, and medication for her stomach. Concomitant medication included amlodipine for high blood pressure and atorvastatin for cholesterol. The patient has been on amlodipine in a good while, 7-8 years and atorvastatin for 5 years. The patient had the COVID shot on Friday, 29Jan2021 at 14:00, and about 4 hours afterward, she had a bad experience. She became very nauseated and lost her sight for 5 minutes. Everything was grey. She was wondering if there is anything she can take afterward. She was scheduled for her next one on 19Feb2021. She was wondering if she will experience the same thing. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. After getting the vaccine, she was on her way back. She began to feel very nauseated in the car. Then, all the sudden she wanted to throw up, but couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t hear her niece or say anything to her. She clarified she could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away. She couldn&#39;t respond. She rolled the window down to get air in her face. She hadn&#39;t eaten. In about 25-30 minutes got better. Since then, she hasn&#39;t been eating like she should, so she was still a little nauseated. It has improved though. She got the vaccine in her left arm.  Her right arm is mostly metal. She decided to get it because she is over 70 and wanted to prevent getting COVID-19. It was also reported that she was also on an arthritis medication, medications for her heart and a medication for her stomach. She has had no problems with those medications though. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included weight: lost on an unspecified date. She has lost about 11 pounds because she has been on a diet. She gave up sugar. The outcome of the events &#34;lost eye sight for 5 minutes, everything was grey&#34;, &#34;could hear her niece, but that her niece sounded far away&#34; and &#34;very nauseated/wanted to throw up but couldn&#39;t&#34; was recovered on 29Jan2021 while the outcome of all other events was unknown.

Reported flu like symptoms over the next two days (fatigue, nausea, anorexia). 2/2/21 awoke with abdominal pain and distension. Presented to MHN ED 2/2/21 @ 1100 for workup and initially declined admission and went home. Was called and asked to return for admission and further workup, admitted to MHN 2/2/21 @ 1750. Fever, myalgias, headache. CT abd/pelvis &#34;There is mild diffuse mesenteric edema surrounding the abdominal aorta and proximal branches. Additionally, there is mild bowel wall thickening involving the stomach without discrete mass. This is nonspecific and may represent infectious versus inflammatory changes.&#34; Per provider note &#34;flu-like sx over the weekend that easily coincide with the timing of the COVID Pfizer vaccine. In addition, I wonder if her CT scan findings might also be related to the vaccine.&#34; Discharged home the next day.

Admission lab included SCr 8.55 mg/dL and K&#43; 5.7 mmol/L. Repeat K&#43; level 7.0 mmol/L (6 hours later). Pt admitted, vascath placed, emergently dialyzed. Further work up revealed positive anti-nuclear antibody, positive anti-nuclear antibody titer, and elevated glomerular basement membrane antibody. High dose steroids (methylprednisone 1g iv qday x 3 days) started for presumed vasculitis.  Renal biopsy performed, results c/w severe crescentic acute glomerulonephritis.  Treated with rituximab 375mg/m2, subsequently transferred to another facility for plamapheresis.

                                                DEATH-My Mother received her second Pfizer vaccine on Thursday, February 18, 2021 and died three days later on Sunday, February 21, 2021, after being admitted to the intensive care unit at  Hospital.  After developing an adverse reaction that started with nausea and then got progressively worse, including vomiting blood, Mom was rushed to the emergency room where she was tested for Covid-19 due to hospital policy (neg. result) and admitted to the intensive care unit.  Mother died on Sunday, February 21, 2021.    NOTE:  Mother was doing well with her heart and renal conditions until she received the second dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 18, 2021, directly or indirectly causing her death three days later on February 21, 2021.  It is unfortunate that we are all advised (sometimes ill advised), particularly those with underlying conditions, to get vaccinated without the benefits of knowing when the vaccine can cause more harm than good.  For obvious reasons, the approval of covid vaccines was rushed and thus the Pfizer and Moderna Studies are not thorough and lack in data to support an all call for everyone to get vaccinated in the name of herd immunity.  Without the appropriate data, My Mother is DEAD!  Sadly, there are probably more unreported deaths caused by the vaccine.  While you have immunity from liability, you still have a moral obligation to collect data and advise accordingly.    My goal is to save lives by sharing my mother?s personal experience and death after receiving the vaccine with everyone I know through every available resource.  It is unconscionable that I have to shoulder the burden of getting the facts out about your vaccine so that individuals with underlying conditions can make a proper, informed decision about getting vaccinated.  Sadly, I receive over 100 questions a day via social media from individuals inquiring about whether or not they or their loved ones should opt for the vaccine.  I am not a medical professional?this is your job!  Until you assume responsibility, I will continue advising anyone with heart and/or renal conditions to stay away from any and all covid vaccinations.  Instead of the massive all call for vaccinations, we need further information and data from additional studies that will give more insight as to when the vaccine can cause more harm than good, as in My Mother?s case.

Diarrhea only lasted about 1 day, but fatigue ( which demanded many naps) and achey body lasted until Monday night.  Woke up Tuesday feeling stronger, but still had lower back ache and tiredness - not extreme fatigue, but still so very tired - fewer naps.  Today is Thursday and I am still quite tired, lower sore back ache.   Never had a fever.

A 76 years old female consumer reported that she received 1st dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) on the 12Feb2021 at around 04:30PM single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history and concomitant drugs were not provided. At midnight that same day on 12Feb2021, she started getting stomach cramps, bowel movements, diarrhea, rectal bleeding which then became rectal hemorrhage. She did not go to the hospital. She said the effects dissipated; however, she still felt nauseated today (26Feb2021). The patient was currently taking ondansetron (ZOFRAN). She has been feeling weak and not well. She had a colonoscopy planned soon. She&#39;s concerned about receiving the second dose. She mentioned as well that she believed she was allergic to an ingredient in the vaccine: &#34;polyethylene glycol&#34;. Outcome of nausea was not recovered. Outcome of other events was unknown.  Information about lot/batch number has been requested.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot: EN6203), via an unspecified route of administration in left arm on 27Feb2021 (at the age of 76years) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed in 1999; Covid-19 from 23Nov2020 to Dec2020 (went to the hospital because of pain in her side at night. Was told she had pneumonia and pleurisy, she got it 2 days after her husband did, but hers was a mild case); her husband had Covid in Nov2020 and died in Dec2020 and hemorrhoids (from having babies years ago). Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol (EXCEDRIN). The patient had no investigation assessment. The patient scheduled her first dose for 27Dec2021. The patient had questions about it, but the person administering it did not speak English and she said that initially she did not have any reactions while she was there. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 27Feb2021 and has a lot of adverse events. After the getting the shot, she woke up at 0400 and experienced shaking (whole body was shaking), trembling out of control, hurting from her neck down to her toes, her joints were achy, hurt, and stiff, her teeth were chattering and couldn&#39;t stop, and when she tried to stop that it made it worse, when she got up she had hard time walking, so much that when she had diarrhea, she had diarrhea on the floor, she also noticed that the color of the diarrhea looked red and looked like it had blood on it but she was not sure. After that, she sat down in a chair and noticed that it had blood when she got up and suspected that she had hemorrhoids and bleeding because of the diarrhea. She thought it was a result of the reaction to the shot. She noted that that she had COVID on 23Nov2020 and that she heard that people who had COVID might not need to get the second shot but it was only speculation so she was asking if this was true. She mentioned that she waited 90 days before getting the vaccine as per CDC guidelines and knew that the 2nd dose can be given for 42 days after the first dose. The patient&#39;s daughter in law who was an occupational therapist volunteered to fly in and take care of her after the second shot on 27Mar2021 but her 2nd shot was due on 20Mar2021 so she wouldn&#39;t be there until then. The patient was having a hard time rescheduling her appointment so asked if there was anything can be done. The patient would prefer not to take the second dose due to the side effects. The patient also reported that it looked like someone who had a stroke trying to walk again, her gait was off and she was kind of jerking. As she would take a step her foot would go down on a slant like it was skidding. She said that this happened one other time to her. It was like she was leaning forward and could not stop herself. When she was able to get up, she went into the living room and sat in her husband&#39;s chair and fell asleep until 15:00. When she got up, she noticed a lot of blood in the chair. The patient asked if this was allowed. She went home and took a couple of acetylsalicylic acid, caffeine, paracetamol because she did not have paracetamol (Tylenol), and she went to sleep. She had a hard time rolling and trying to get out of bed. She turned on her electric blankety and her heat. She said that by 0600 most of the shaking had gone away. She felt a little nausea, but got some dry toast. She said that she wanted to take a shower, but she started getting diarrhea from the injection. She fell in the bathroom and could not get herself up for over an hour because she was too weak. When she fell on the floor, she tried to get on a rug because she was still having the diarrhea on the floor. She said that it was everywhere. The next day she called her son and his wife they said that she could be alone for her second shot. She was scheduled for 20Mar2021 for her second dose. The patient had a hard time changing the appointment and her son could not come to stay with her until 27Mar2021. A friend told the patient that on the news it said that a second shot may not be necessary for people who have had Covid-19 already and she wanted to know if Pfizer has heard of this. The patient said that she was kind of wiped out for a couple of days (in 2021) and it was all over now. The doctor&#39;s office was aware of what happened and she was told to take extra strength Tylenol before and after the second injection to address these symptoms. The consumer considered the case as non-serious. The outcome of the event fatigue was recovered in 2021 while for the remaining events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Right Arm on 02Mar2021 14:26 (Batch/Lot Number: EN619G) as single dose for vaccination. Medical history included joint replacements (specified as 1 hip done in 2007; right knee done in Jan2013; another knee was done in Feb2017; another knee was done in 1986); and in 2011, neck fracture. There were no concomitant medications. The patient had the 1st dose of the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE and on 02Mar2021, she had sore on the injection site, experienced excess saliva production. On 05Mar2021, she experienced chills, feeling of heart attack: left arm pain, jaw pain, facial pain. She is worried to take the 2nd shot as she might have more symptoms on the 2nd dose. On an unspecified date, the patient had lower back, hips, knees, neck pain, eye socket hurts when rolling her eyes, sore stomach, and exhausted. It was also reported as follows: on 02Mar2021 after she got home from being administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine she had quite a bit of saliva in her mouth, it filled up quite a lot; and a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days but that was about it at that point. On Friday, 05Mar2021 she started getting chills and aches; and felt like she was having a heart attack: her left arm hurt and her left side of face hurt down in her jaw. She was afraid and considered going to the hospital but thought she was going to wait it out see what it is and it passed. She then once again got a lot of saliva in her mouth again. Over the next few days she developed aches that were primarily located in her joint replacements, it seemed like the aches attacked those areas of joint replacements in her hips, knees and where she had a neck fracture. She had a lot of pain and a lot of chills. She was never bedridden, but would lay down because she was exhausted. Her back hurt a tremendous amount. Another thing that happened is her eyes, when she would go to move her eyes left or right or up or down it seemed like her eye sockets just hurt to move her eyes; she did not have a headache; this whole indentation there with her eyes hurt to move them from one side to another. She also had a very sore, uncomfortable stomach; it was not an upset stomach; just seemed very sore, uncomfortable. At first that first part of 05Mar2021 she seemed a bit congested. She is very worried about second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine because of the first dose creating all of these difficulties. She does not know what she should be doing. She is scheduled to get her second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine on 24Mar2021 because she is leaving by plane on 29Mar2021. That only gives her like 4-5 days before she leaves and she knows that the other symptoms after the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine did not start until 3 days later. She is concerned about that, because she is flying to take care of her sister; she is worried about the second dose because she does not like what she experienced with the first dose because she heard that the second dose will be terrible; she is worried about leaving and experiencing those horrible things. She reported that there are no tests/investigations relative to this report to provide. The only thing recently done was having X-rays of her neck on 24Feb2021 because of her neck issues with the fractured neck she had in 2011. Outcome of the events was unknown.

A 76-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Batch/lot number: EW0158) via an unspecified route of administration in right shoulder (Deltoid Right) on 11Apr2021 in the afternoon around 14:00 or 14:30 (at 76-year-old) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was not reported. None history of all previous immunization with BNT162B2 considered as suspect. Concomitant medication included cetirizine hydrochloride (ZYRTEC) for sinus disorder for years as needed. She took it the day before the COVID19 injection. She hasn&#39;t taken it since before getting COVID19 injection. No additional vaccines administered on same date of BNT162B2. No prior vaccinations within 4 weeks. She didn&#39;t have the ones on the paper. They didn&#39;t say she would have severe throwing up she almost had to call. She was choking on 12Apr2021. She was over it currently. She first threw up on Sunday evening and then was ok. On Sunday (11Apr2021 21:00) she only threw up once, but it was four intervals. Caller clarified an interval was where she would throw up then clean up and then throw up again. Then it was fine. On Monday (12Apr2021), in the evening around 9 PM she started to spin. She went to the bathroom and she was heaving and she couldn&#39;t say how many times she threw up. Her throat was so swollen and it felt like she was choking. Her throat was very raw. Her uvula was so swollen that is why she felt like she was choking. She was about to go the emergency room, but then looked it up. She did treatment that she saw online for 3 days. When she was gagging and coughing she looked up COVID19 Vaccine and it said that her throat would be swollen from severe throwing up. It made a lot of sense.

                                                About 20 minutes after the injection I started to feel like I was going to vomit, got nauseated and dizzy..  I had left the site after the 15 minute wait,  and since I read that Nausea was one of the side effects, I thought it would go away.  I waited another  30 minutes in my car at a parking lot outside the hospital in case I really  couldn&#39;t drive home.  I did drive home , but have been feeling the same nausea every day and some dizziness and diarrhea for the past 11 days.  I called my doctor and she said to take it easy, drink fluids, eat light and that I could get the second shot. I am not sure if this is just a reaction or a severe allergic reaction and I need advice and feedback on that issue.

She says that if she touches the injection site she can feel it; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable consumer (patient). A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284, expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 16Jan2021 11:30, at single dose, for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ablation and watchmen procedure (successful) both in 2020, atrial fibrillation (A-fib) and sensitive stomach. Concomitant medication included acetylsalicylic acid (BABY ASPIRIN 81 mg, lot number: NAA80DX, expiry date: Aug2021). The patient reported that she had her first dose of the vaccine this past Saturday (16Jan2021), and she did not have adverse events, but she was having some upset stomach on 17Jan2021 and diarrhea on 18Jan2021 and would like to know if this could be a side effect. She stated she woke up during the night of 17Jan2021 after her stomach was jumping around. She stated she has a sensitive stomach, anyway, normally; and her arm was not real sore, which she was surprised. She said that if she touches the injection site, she can feel it (pending clarification), but it is not throbbing, aching, or swollen. She stated that she was not sure if it could be the spaghetti they had for dinner, but this morning (18Jan221) she had some diarrhea. When asked about treatment, she said she didn&#39;t take anything for this because she doesn&#39;t like to take medicine, and if it is from the vaccine it should go away in a day or so but her diarrhea stayed about the same and has not gotten any better or worse. She also noticed the paperwork that said don&#39;t take Ibuprofen, Aspirin, or blood thinners, and mentioned she takes baby aspirin every day, she wanted to know if that was okay. The outcome of the event diarrhea was not recovered; and the remaining events was unknown.

A 77-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 25Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s medical history was reported as none. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient received the first dose of the COVID vaccine and was experiencing high blood pressure on an unspecified date in Jan2021. Patient went to the ER and they told her something in the vaccine made it go up. Patient would like to know what in the vaccine would cause her blood pressure to go up and if any has experienced high blood pressure as a side effect of the vaccine. Patient reported that she didn&#39;t feel good, felt like she was getting a migraine and after that she started getting dizzy and she thought she was going to help herself and lay down on the bed for about 45 minutes and then she got up after that and walked around on Jan2021. She felt like, she has never had a hangover but it felt like she had a hangover, that was what it felt like, and she thought she hopes that doesn&#39;t last and she got up Wednesday morning (Jan2021) and went to her podiatrist appointment. She didn&#39;t feel good but she was okay so she went to the podiatrist and then later she was fixing supper and she had some grease in a pan that she fried something in and she thought she wanted to get some water in it so she went to go with the pan and she got to the door and took 3 steps back and she thought good Lord, there is something is wrong here. She did empty the water and the grease and she thought well it is going to have to stay there, it was right at the back door so anyway. Her son came home from work and she got him get the blood pressure cuff and take her pressure and it was 158/98 and she thought, this was not good. She said she will just go lay down for a while and she went on to bed. The patient was taken into the hospital via an ambulance. She sat there until about 4-5 hours and later they got to take her blood pressure and result was 189/92 on Jan2021. They gave her some IV because she was dehydrated and she got home, she lives about 30 miles form the hospital so they got home about 3 o&#39;clock and next day she didn&#39;t feel good but she felt better. She confirmed she was not admitted to the hospital it was an ER visit and they sent her home. She felt Thursday was not a good day she came down off of what had her up. She was going to say no to the second dose because she was sick on her stomach and drunk as a dog, she was really dizzy, very dizzy and she just had to sit down quiet her self. She was supposed to have surgery but because of COVID it has been cancelled 3 times. The outcome of the events were unknown.

Sat down again but had to do so I hung on to the bed, walls, and doors to steady myself to get to bathroom.  Had a little diarrhea.  Managed to take 2 Tylenol and drank lots of water.  I held on to everything again and got back to bed but sat up instead of laying down.  I still had diarrhea so I held on to every thing again and took one Anti-Diarrhea pill.  Went back to bed sitting up and tried to sleep.  Got up around 8 am and felt better but still a little woozy.

                                                March 12, 2021 - On Friday about 2pm, I started with a runny nose ? by Sunday afternoon it was like a faucet turned on ? running down my face. March 13 - Saturday morning, I started coughing c chest congestion, and had Phlegm rattling in my chest, started sneezing very frequently/ some diarrhea.  Otherwise, I felt fine. March 14 - Sunday morning, I started wheezing slightly, coughing more and sneezing frequently.  Felt fine.  Went shopping.  Nose ran so much in store, had to run to the store to get paper towels to catch it.  Later, when I carried a heavy bag of groceries from one car 12 feet to another, noticed I was very exhausted and had to rest about 15 minutes before driving home.  Wheezing more. Monday, March 15, I took my B/P meds at 1:00am and my blood pressure was way up x 4 (160?s/ 70?s) p58-64,  at 2:08am ? B/P was 183/92) so I took my PRN Clonidine and ate all the high Potassium foods I had in the house.   By 3:40am my B/P was 120/66 but went back up later with coughing.  I felt fine but tired. A little after 4am,  I carried a bag of apples and a bag of oranges up my stairs and was totally exhausted ? I felt the energy draining out of me, and so was out of breath I dropped the bags on the floor and  sat hyperventilating to get enough air in my lungs until I could breathe normally ? for 40 minutes -  it felt like fluid building in my lungs.  I started massaging my abdomen like crazy and coughing until it subsided ? considering whether I should go to E.R.  My breathing did get some better But I sure did not exert myself.  Just picking up my computer was taking my energy. Still coughing and getting rid of some phlegm.  This was very scary and I was on the verge of going to the E.R.   at 4:45am - I called the E.R. who said I probably could wait for a urgent care to open or talk to Dr.?s office.  My breathing was some better.  By 6:10am I was so tired I fell asleep.   At 10am my B/P was 138/77 p53.  Still very weak, coughing, wheezing, and trying to get rid of phlegm. I had no other symptoms.   I called my Dr. who got me in a urgent care in her building at 3pm.  That evening I started Postural Drainage which helped in getting rid of the phlegm.  I have continued that still. March 16 ? I ?chatted? my doctor to let her know all that was going on.  She scheduled me to see the Respiratory office in her building on the next day.  I was feeling much better ? little nasal dripping, lungs felt better,  March 17 ? Wednesday ? went to Respiratory appt but declined treatment because I felt so much better. More energy, better lungs than Tuesday, wheezing gone, less phlegm, still some coughing ? which is okay with me.  I think this is a severe enough reaction that I should not have the second dose ? which is known to be more severe than the first.

Caller is calling to see if anyone experienced a reaction like a week after having the first COVID shot. She says she didn&#39;t give it a thought because it had been a week, but her friend today suggested maybe she was having a delayed reaction. She received the shot on 25Jan2021, says she only had the sore arm on 26Jan and it was only at the site of the injection like a regular shot, and then last Monday evening 1Feb2021, she started getting headache and the next morning she felt miserable. On 02Feb2021, she had an upset stomach and was vomiting. She was very tired and that went on for a couple days. She couldn&#39;t get off the couch. She had no appetite. Gradually she got a little better and she texted the doctor&#39;s office they suggested she go. they could make her an appointment 25 minutes away to get a COVID test. She was not feeling like driving or riding in the car to get it. Or they suggested that she quarantine for 10 days which is what she has been doing. She is feeling just about back to herself, but she was curious if that could have been from the shot or maybe she just had some other bug. She thinks she was 143 last time a few months ago. The upset stomach and vomiting last also on the 03Feb which made the headache better. She says headache is gone but her head still feels little not quite itself, but the headache is gone. She says the upset stomach and vomiting have recovered completely. The tiredness is ongoing but is much better. She has not had anything else happen and she has had not been around anybody with who was sick unless they were asymptomatic and that would have been only a very few people.

Outcome of the events headache, tiredness, she had no appetite were recovering. Vomiting and upset stomach were recovered.

She added that she had severe chill (&#34;couldn&#39;t get warm&#34;) and nausea then the next morning, she was tired because she didn&#39;t get good sleep the night before and then felt like herself the following day. The nausea stopped 8 hours afterwards. The tiredness was back to normal on 14Jan2021 at 8pm. She mentioned that she was treated for interstitial cystitis before she took the vaccine. She began to experience a headache prior to receiving the vaccination and called the hotline to see if it was COVID. They did not want to test her since she did not have any other symptoms. She got tested for COVID on 18Jan2021, and it came back negative. She inquired if she can take 25mg of diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and acetaminophen (TYLENOL) prior to her receiving her second dose to prevent side effects. Treatment was received by the patient. The outcome of the event feeling unwell was unknown while the outcome of the other events was recovered on 14Jan2021 20:00.

                                                This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) from a Pfizer Sponsored program.  A 78-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 25Jan2021 at 13:00 (at 78 years) at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient medical history included anxiety, headache, dry eye and low potassium, each from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. The patient&#39;s concomitant medication included potassium oral at 10 meq daily for low potassium, cholecalciferol (D3) oral at 2000 iU once a day to help with bones, fish oil oral at 1200 mg once a day, alprazolam at 0.5 mg as needed (take one three times a day) for anxiety, clonazepam oral at 0.5 mg once a day for anxiety, nortriptyline HCl oral at 10 mg once a day, paracetamol (TYLENOL) at 500 mg as needed for headache, estradiol (SYSTEN) ophthalmic one drop as needed, all from an unknown date and ongoing.  The patient experienced one or two hours after the vaccine (on 25Jan2021), she went to talk, she couldn&#39;t get her sentence straight. She knew what she wanted to say but she couldn&#39;t say it. Her first thought was that she was having a stroke and it really scared her. She became very tired and went to sleep, when she woke up, she was talking straight but she was still really tired. The next morning (on 26Jan2021) she had diarrhea three time and after that she felt better. The patient outcome of speech disorder and diarrhea was recovered on 26Jan2021 and the outcome of tiredness was recovering.  The information on the batch number has been requested.

                                                Neurology consult 2/13/21:  This is a 78-year-old female we were consulted by Dr. for possible guillian barre s/p COVID vaccine.  The patient tells me that she was in her normal state of health, and she received her 1st dose of the COVID-19 vaccineseen 7 days ago.  Subsequent to that, the next day she developed chills, fatigue that continued for approximately 2 days.  She states that 3 days ago, she woke up and was unable to lift her legs or get herself out of bed on her own.  She felt weak in her proximal lower extremities and her trunk.  She denied any bandlike sensations or paresthesias.  She cannot tell me that she developed any distal lower extremity weakness initially but felt that it was the acute onset.  She needed some help her out of bed when she was upright, she was able to use her walker to slowly get to the factor.  She may have had some urinary incontinence, she does complain of diarrhea now.   Denies any tingling sensation, no bulbar symptoms.  This is a 78-year-old female who we were asked to evaluate for possible Guillain-Barre syndrome.  She had acute onset of lower much greater than upper extremity weakness without any definite ascending features, of relevance, is that she received the COVID-19 vaccine 3 days prior to the onset of her symptoms.  She did exhibit flu-like symptoms prior to this.  Given that she does not have any specific area of intrathecal enhancement to suggest Guillain-Barre or other areas of radiculitis, I think it is reasonable to proceed with lumbar puncture to look for any other source.   --Given the findings on the MRI cervical and lumbar spine including enhancement of the bilateral sacral S1 region, I would like Neurosurgery to further evaluate. -- would likely benefit from CT chest abdomen pelvis to rule out any underlying occult malignancy particularly if workup remains unremarkable. -- continue supportive care, monitor for shortness of breath, new vital capacities  Patient remains admitted to the hospital with continued weakness at the time of this report

                                                LTC Pharmacy was notified of a potential vaccine related hospital admission on 3/8/2021. The following information was gathered from discussion with RPH at Hospital. The patient received second dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine on 2/26/2021. The patient then had nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake. On 2/27/2021, the patient went to the bathroom and while on the toilet, had a vasovagal event which led to her hitting the side of the face while falling. Patient was then taken to the hospital for evaluation. The patient does have a pacemaker but the cause of the event was determined to likely be due to dehydration. Lab work was performed and pertinent lab values include: potassium of 3.1, SCr of 0.8, and BUN of 13. The patient received potassium supplementation and IV hydration in the hospital. Patient was discharged on 2/28/2021. Of note, the patient does have a pacemaker and a follow-up appointment with cardiology to evaluate the pacemaker was scheduled upon discharge.

                                                I was vaccinated with Pfizer for the first time 11 days ago. Within a few minutes of being vaccinated, I felt nauseated but I did NOT throw up. I have been sick ever since with one thing and another. For the first several days after being vaccinated, I had a sore arm, which I expected. I have also experienced extreme fatigue, chills, nausea, muscle and joint aches, a sore throat (briefly), an occasional headache, tenderness in my left armpit and along the left side of my rib cage, stomach pain and diarrhea and at times, a low-grade fever and sweating. My memory and ability to focus on my work have been affected. Yesterday (March 13), I felt OK all day and thought I was better at last, but after I ate dinner, I vomited and had diarrhea. I told my primary care physician about all of this in an email and she replied that my symptoms were &#34;normal.&#34; I&#39;m not so sure. I haven&#39;t read of anyone else feeling so sick for so long after the first dose of Pfizer.

                                                I had the second Covid (Pfizer) vaccine on February 22. The next day I had chills, fever, aches, nausea and was very weak. After about 30 hours I felt okay again.  However, a week and a half later, I noticed red bumps on the back of my neck. The next day, my neck and scalp had red, itchy blotches. Through the next five days, these spread down my body to my ankles until I was covered with the red, very itchy blotches. I did go to Urgent Care on the third day and I was given a 5-day prescription of Prednisone. It did not do much until the third day and then it relieved the itching somewhat for about 6 hours, but then it would start again. After the five days of Prednisone, I took Benedryl for three days until the itch and redness disappeared.  I checked the facility web site on types of rashes and my rash fits the description (and the photo) of a drug-related rash, but I have not changed or added any drugs for several years other than the Covid vaccine (I did some research online and found two other people who have had the same problems I have had after the second Covid vaccine. Both of them had the typical reaction of chills, fever, aches and dizziness for about a day after the second shot and then 1-2 weeks later, broke out in a rash. Both reported having the rash start at the neck or head and then spreading down the body throughout one to two weeks before disappearing. There were photos on the facility site of drug-related rashes and they were exactly like what I had.  Since the rash was almost certainly covid vaccine related, I am making this report, which my doctor recommended. I had no other changes in diet, medications, environment, etc. ? only the Pfizer vaccine was new to my body.

This nurse (patient) reported that a 78-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, batch/lot number: EN6204) at the age of 78-years, via an unspecified route of administration on 04Mar2021 at single dose; first single dose of BNT162B2 (lot: EM9810) on 11Feb2021; both for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included osteoarthritis (having aches and pains) had for 20 years; large sliding hiatal hernia was diagnosed from an EGD six months before, didn&#39;t want surgery to fix it; heartburn (last five years); fatty liver, was not from drinking alcohol; generalized anxiety; was tuberculosis positive only because she was exposed years ago. Concomitant medications included pantoprazole started four to five years before at 40 mg twice a day for heartburn; escitalopram (tablet) been on for 15 years or longer at 10 mg 1 DF every day for generalized anxiety; clonazepam 0.5 mg nightly at bedtime for anxiety (been taking for last ten years or more, stops her from worrying about her kids and stuff like that). The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn&#39;t take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor&#39;s office wouldn&#39;t give her an appointment. Stated this wasn&#39;t the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller&#39;s daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn&#39;t feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn&#39;t her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn&#39;t order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn&#39;t itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn&#39;t take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn&#39;t want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn&#39;t right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn&#39;t nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn&#39;t help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn&#39;t make her sick, just didn&#39;t want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren&#39;t really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn&#39;t feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn&#39;t itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn&#39;t think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn&#39;t working and her body couldn&#39;t get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn&#39;t think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like &#34;oh that second shot.&#34; If she didn&#39;t get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn&#39;t know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn&#39;t take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn&#39;t want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn&#39;t think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn&#39;t know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn&#39;t say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn&#39;t feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn&#39;t eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

A 78-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE, Lot Number: EN6205), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Right on 11Mar2021 11:00, single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included silent heart attack, ongoing Barrett&#39;s oesophagus from 2008, fall she had over two months (2021), eye surgery on an unknown date. She does not get any shots and can&#39;t have shots even for the flu shot because she had problems with two flu shots she had; states she had a problem with each one of the flu shots and does not know the names of the flu shots and has no lot numbers to provide for them; states she had the flu shots in the early 1990&#39;s and worked in healthcare and had to have them and they told her back then if she wanted to work she had to have the flu shots and then she got sick with both of the flu shots and they said they guessed they would not force her to have the flu shots. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient had the first dose administered and then about 14 hours after (12Mar2021) that she had no problems until it began working up her arm with arm pain and chest pain which persisted and she went to the hospital and was admitted for 23 hours. She does not know what to do about getting the 2nd dose of the vaccine and was at her cardiologist&#39;s this week and he said he is not familiar with the Pfizer vaccine causing chest pain; caller states she has a history of silent heart attacks. She still has tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight and they told her to mention if she does go for the second dose of the vaccine to mention that she had this situation.The chest pain and arm pain began 12Mar2021 and the arm pain is in her right arm where the vaccine was administered and the arm pain and chest pain have resolved; states the arm pain and chest pain stopped and she thinks that lasted about an hour and a half and she called a family member to take her to the hospital; states about 2:30am that same day she was admitted the morning of 12Mar2021 and was discharged on 13Mar2021. They ran every test known to the patient and for a while her blood pressure went up to 198/203 in the emergency room (12Mar2021) and she is not on any medication; caller states she does have Crestor but has not started on it and has not taken it yet. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight began the same time she was having the chest pain and she is not having any chest pain or anything like that right now but the tiredness and difficulty swallowing like her throat is still tight is still ongoing; states she did go get cardiac clearance to make sure which was this past week and she does not feel well and like for her the tiredness is bugging her. The tiredness and difficulty swallowing are better but she knows they are there and she tries to swallow something and is like boy her throat is still tight. They did an ultrasound in her left leg because she was limping from a fall she had over two months ago but still has a sore ankle from that and they sent her down for the ultrasound and a CT looking for blood clots in her lungs because she was short of breath (12Mar2021); caller states she thinks they were running everything they could to rule out things; states everything was negative for the CT and ultrasound and she believes the CT and ultrasound were done on 12Mar2021. She has no idea when she was diagnosed with silent heart attacks but they kept asking her about this when she went in for eye surgery and asked her when she had a heart attack and she said she had never had one and they said yes she had and she never knew. She just set up a HCP appointment after the reported events with a gastroenterologist because she has Barrett&#39;s and because of the esophagus she did not know if it flared up by the Pfizer vaccine and that caused the pain because the two pains of the heart and esophagus mimic each other with pain going up into the jaw so they were ruling out which one it was; states she went out as an atypical chest pain and called the cardiologist and went in and went over her records from the hospital with the cardiologist. She does not know what caused what in terms of the pain. The outcome of the event blood pressure increased was unknown, chest pain and pain in arm was recovered, other events was recovering.

She is running a fever, has chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite because she is nauseous; all on 06Jan2021 at 06:00. This is the third day of it.  She would like to know what she can she do. She said that it all started Wednesday morning when she got up. It just gets worse every day.  It looks like it would get better by now, but it hasn&#39;t.  She never runs a temperature, but she has now (unspecified date).  She is still freezing to death on unspecified date. She usually has a good appetite.  Even the thought of food makes her sick. She further reported that she has had nothing but chills, fever, and nausea and states it will not go away. She is treating it with ibuprofen. She confirms she already talked to a nurse in this department to report this and she was transferred to see what she could do and states they never answered. This is her first dose and she does not know if she should get the second dose. The patient can&#39;t calm down since she has been sick since last Wednesday. She stated that she needed some help because she is so sick. She was suggested to call again calling Pfizer medical information department. She stated that she had called back three times, but there is no such number. The events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous were considered serious (Other medically important condition). The outcome of the events sick as a dog, fever, chills, can&#39;t eat and has no appetite, and nauseous was not recovered, and the outcome of the remaining event was unknown.; Sender&#39;s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported events cannot be completed based on known safety profile and a compatible temporal relation between vaccination and onset of events.

She texted her daughter who is a nurse and got there about 1:00 PM, she was still in bed.  When she tried to sit her up she felt like she was going to throw up.  She put her legs over to the side of the bed, and she felt like somebody was pushing her with her daughter over a cliff, in a tornado and on a Ferris wheel.  She started vomiting and having diarrhea.  She had heard about an epley maneuver and after a time she sat her up again and still had the previous feeling of going off a mountain in a tornado.  She did the epley maneuver and tilter her head to the left and was still very dizzy but not as bad.  She then tilted her head to the right and it was not as bad.   Things started to settle down and eventually she was able to get up, still nauseated but 90% better.  She was able to go to the restroom with her daughter&#39;s help.  She stayed in the bed all that day and finally in the evening was abler to keep food down.   She limited her distance to the bed to the bathroom.   Her doctor was notified and called in some nausea  and vertigo medicine (meclizine), which he did and only took 2 doses of that.  The next morning she went up and down the stairs to make sure she was able to.  She was very, very cautious but each day has been better.  On 2/2/21 she called and got an APT with ENT but will not see him in a couple of weeks.  They are going to send a therapist tomorrow to evaluate her for the vertigo.  She is scheduled for the 2nd vaccine on 2/11/21.   Saw her internist today and he evaluated her and did 2 blood tests and sent the referral for the therapist to come tomorrow.

                                                urine issues/kept going to the bathroom to urinate; upset stomach; diarrhea; felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second; dizziness; Had a funny taste in her mouth; felt very weird, strange; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient). This consumer reported same events for two patients (one is patient self). This is the first of two reports. This 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EL1284), via an unspecified route of administration to right arm on 13Jan2021 15:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies to Sulfas, Penicilins, and Avelox, Sulfa or Penicillin allergies since she was a child and had the Avelox allergies about 15-16 years ago. None concomitant medications. Patient did not receive any other vaccines that day or 4 weeks prior. Did get the original Shingles vaccine about 3 years ago and then they came out with the new one and she got the first dose of that and believes she had a reaction to that one, thinks it was a rash. Also had the flu shot and she usually gets sick with it, but didn&#39;t with this last one. Thinks her body is just delicate. No vaccines administered on same date. Patient had the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on 13Jan2021 15:00 and she was fine. She had a reaction the following day (on 14Jan2021). At 11am the next day she got very dizzy and felt like she was going to faint, pass out at any second. Used cold compresses and drank water and took deep breaths, but she didn&#39;t pass out. She had a funny taste in her mouth. Then from that time until about 7pm she had urine issues and kept going to the bathroom to urinate and had diarrhea and upset stomach. Patient felt like she was out of her body, felt very weird, strange. Doctor stated she maybe had a reaction to the vaccine and recommended for her to take Tylenol. She didn&#39;t take it until right before going to bed. She was able to sleep on 14th night. Woke up the next morning and was fine. She didn&#39;t see any of these reactions listed and that happened. Patient explained to a friend of the reactions and the friend mentions that she also had a friend who had the vaccine and had the same exact reactions, everything. Everything improved and stopped the next morning she was fine, on the 15th. No Emergency Room or Physician Office visit. The events outcome was recovered on 15Jan2021. It was just a span of time and she has to assume that it was the vaccine since she has never had that before. Patient does not know if she should blame the vaccine because she also has a lot of allergies to a lot of antibiotics and does not know what caused her reactions.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Linked Report(s) : US-PFIZER INC-2021065869 Same reporter/ vaccine/ AEs, different patient

A 79-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9265), via an unspecified route of administration, on 02Feb2021 12:00 at a single dose on the right arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, knee surgery, and bulging disc.  The patient had an MRI on an unspecified date in Jan2021 (a week and a half prior to the date of initial report) with result of bulging disc. Concomitant medications included fluticasone furoate (ARNUITY ELLIPTA) for asthma; She was supposed to take 1 puff a day. However, being in the house, she had no problems, she had maybe used it twice a week since she hasn&#39;t had any problems, she last took 1 puff on 01Feb2021). She was also taking vitamin pills concomitantly. On 04Feb2021 23:00, 2 days after the vaccine, the patient had sweats, was wringing wet, and was not feeling well. Her hair was wet, and she was sweating. She was okay on the morning of 05Feb2021 but not herself. She had a little nausea on 05Feb2021. She was just not quite herself on 05Feb2021 but doesn&#39;t have the sweats. She further reported that she had her first shot on 02Feb2021 12:00. She was fine and had no problems. However, on night of 04Feb2021, before bed, she started getting hot and sweaty, like she was wringing wet. She didn&#39;t feel good, but 2 days had gone by and she was fine. She also went to bed with something like chills (later clarified as not chills), she went to sleep on the morning of 05Feb2021 and felt okay but not that great. When queried when the chills started, she said that it was not really chills, she was just very sweaty, wringing wet. She stated that she never sweats, and in this case her whole hair was wet. Being older, she was wondering what was going. Her feeling hot and sweaty subsided during the night. She did start to feel nausea, or she thought maybe she hasn&#39;t had anything to eat and so had a half banana and then she was okay. She thought she was hungry and felt funny, she had the half banana and was okay. She also felt a little shaky and nervous on 04Feb2021; however, it all subsided after going to bed. At the date of report, 05Feb2021, she felt okay but she didn&#39;t feel completely herself. Her second dose is scheduled on 26Feb2021 at 9:15 AM. Outcome of events feeling hot and sweaty was recovered with sequel on 05Feb2021. Outcome of event not feeling well was unknown. Outcome of event nausea was recovered on 05Feb2021. Outcome of the events shaky and nervous was recovered on 04Feb2021. Outcome of she was just not quite herself was not recovered.

A 79-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration, administered in right arm on 18Feb2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EN6201) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included family history of glaucoma from 2019 (Her mother has Glaucoma); memory ain&#39;t that good (she puts everything on her calendar because her memory ain&#39;t that good); ongoing irregular heart beat since 2006 (periodically when she goes to the doctor they have her walk the treadmill and stuff like that); ongoing diabetes since 2011; and was allergic to Penicillin (as a kid she was bitten by a dog, she must have been about 12 years old, went to hospital they gave her a shot of penicillin, her head blew up, she looked like a monster, she went back they gave her Streptomycin). Concomitant medication(s) included brimonidine taken for glaucoma from 21Feb2021 to 01Mar2021; latanoprost taken for glaucoma; apixaban (ELIQUIS) taken for arrhythmia, and dyspnoea from 2019 and ongoing; and metoprolol taken for arrhythmia. The patient was administered with her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine on 18Feb2021. It went beautiful, she did not have any aftereffects or anything initially. On 01Mar2021, while in her own apartment she stood up to go to the bathroom and could not put her right leg down; she thought she was having a heart attack or a stroke or something and she fell on her right side. She went to the hospital where she was hospitalized overnight for observation and testing. MRI performed during that hospitalization had result of Cerebrovascular Accident-CVA. She also reported onset of diarrhea and nose running around 01Mar2021. When she went to the hospital on 01Mar2021 she was laying down, and when the doctor moved the blanket to test her legs her calves were so sore, like having charley horse where her calf muscles were so tight it hurt. The events were reported to have required a visit to the emergency room. They did not find anything else during hospitalization with testing. The only thing she can think of related to these events was the COVID-19 vaccine. She called to ask if she should or should not get the second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as scheduled for 11Mar2021 relative to these events.

It was the first dose. The COVID-19 vaccine was administered at Hospital. Medical history included glaucoma she had drops to take for, mostly she just has problem with her joints and her back with her age. She did not have any diseases or anything; she was not diabetic, nothing like that. There were no concomitant medications. She was administered her first dose of COVID-19 Vaccine on 22Dec2020. She reported that the pain or little discomfort she had in the arm she received the injection in disappeared by 25Dec2020. But on 24Dec2020 she started to get very sick, which continued to worsen until now when she felt like she was improving. She did not know if these events could have something to do with the COVID-19 Vaccine. Pain or little discomfort in the arm she received the injection: Right arm. Everyone warned her that the site would hurt, so she was really glad when it totally went away on 25Dec2020 and thought that it was over; any issues from the injection. Very sick: this event started to get bad on 24Dec2020, she was very tired and not very hungry, she had stomach and abdominal pains and loose stool; 25Dec2020 those symptoms were  worse. It was Christmas so she cooked and thought at first maybe she got carried away baking pies; because that evening she started to have pain and did not each much. 26Dec2020 it was worse; she said she was going to work on 27Dec2020; it was terrible because she was stuck for 12 hours trying to work while very sick.

She did not know what she would have done without the ranitidine. She did not have any more abdominal pain, but her stomach was still very sensitive. She was tired but thought she was going to be ok. She was scared to get the second scheduled dose of COVID-19 Vaccine because she thought the side effects will be more severe with the booster shot. She just needed to rest and stay home which she has been doing. She has not had any fever. She has not notified her family doctor of these events. There was nothing she did on Christmas that she could think of other than she drank a glass of champagne because she did not know her stomach was going to be so bad.

                                                Within 15-minutes of vaccination, the patient reported dizziness and a heartburn sensation in her chest. EMS noted orthostatic hypotension in the field, systolic was in the 130s when sitting with a rapid drop to the 70s upon standing. Patient was transported to emergency department. In the ED, the patient reported having a dry mouth and having not eaten breakfast. Patient was administered IV fluids and noted improvement. Labs were unremarkable. Diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension secondary to dehydration, vasovagal episode, and GERD.

Abdominal pain complaints increased and continued, she decompensated rapidly, was intubated and subsequently died 3 days later.  Imaging results showed, progressive ovarian cancer in the bowels.  Blood culture revealed that she had E.Coli in her blood.  It is thought that this is NOT related to the vaccine.

                                                The night after receiving dose 1 of the vaccine, she didn&#39;t want to eat dinner, was starting to spit up saliva, and noted a new headache, and asked her daughter to sleep with her that night considering she was feeling poorly. She was restless all night, and then at ~5am her L arm began to twitch; she was still alert at this time but didn&#39;t realize her arm was moving. Shortly after this she lost consciousness, her eyes rolled back in her head, and she developed a frank GTC seizure. Her daughter called an ambulance, and by the time she was on the way to the hospital, she was awake and alert again. At the hospital, she was initially talking and able to answer most questions appropriately. She was noted to be afebrile, hemodynamically stable, without an O2 requirement, though with tachycardia to the 110s.  She was found to have a leukocytosis to ~16, thrombocytosis to ~550, and LDH elevated in the 600s. Over the following day, her mental status declined and she became agitated and disoriented to place/time. CT chest revealed b/l multifocal pneumonia, for which she was started on pip-tazo. She underwent MRI brain (DWI sequence only) which did not reveal any obvious CVA. LP was performed on 1/29 at ~10PM; as far as we can tell, she had only received pip-tazo for antibiotics at this point. CSF studies revealed 220 WBCs (14% PMNs, 76% lymphs, 10% monos), 14 RBCs, Glu 59, Prot 145; GS 2&#43; WBCs, no orgs; india ink stain negative; Cx pending at time of transfer. Given concern for bacterial or viral meningoencephalitis she was transitioned to vancomycin/ceftriaxone/acyclovir. Patient was then transferred to another Hospital for further management. Micro was all negative or pending at the time of transfer. Shortly after admission to hospital she was intubated. Spine MRI was notable for longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis. All infectious workup has been negative with just two more pending studies for tuberculosis; autoantibody panel pending. She is now able to follow commands with eyes and mouth, but has not been able to move her arms or legs.  We do not have high suspicion that this syndrome is related to the vaccine, given that progressive neurological symptoms started the week before vaccine, but thought it prudent to report given the time course.

                                                Patient had her second COVID vaccine on 2/20/21.  The next day she developed diffuse body aches.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She therefore presented to the ER on 2/25/21.  See full history below from infectious disease note on 3/1/21: Patient  is an 80 year old female who has a past medical history notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hypothyroidism. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade lymphoma of the retroperitoneum in 2004 and completed 4 cycles of multi-chemotherapy (Cytoxan, Adriamycin, vincristine, methotrexate, and IT chemotherapy (Magrath-like regimen)). She completed 4 cycles with complete remission on PET scan. The biopsy of a left cervical lymph node in 2007 revealed follicular lymphoma and she completed radiation therapy to the neck with complete remission. A left axillary lymph node biopsy in 2016 revealed grade-3 follicular lymphoma with mixed follicular and diffuse histology. Chemotherapy was pursued. The biopsy of a pelvic lymph node in 2019 was consistent with G1-2 follicular lymphoma.  She completed radiation to the pelvis in May of 2019.  She developed progressive pelvic adenopathy in April of 2020 and received 5 cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent CT showed improvement in the adenopathy.  Her course was complicated by pulmonary emboli (September 2020).  In November of 2020 she was started on maintenance Rituxan every 2 months.  She received the 2-dose Pfizer COVID vaccine series on 1/29/21 and 2/20/21.   With the above background, the patient presented to the emergency room on February 25, 2021 with complaints of diffuse body aches, which had developed that day after receiving her second dose of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine.  She went on to develop worsening dyspnea and fever to 103°F on February 23.  She had a fever again on February 24. The patient also experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea but no abdominal pain and had pain of the legs, right greater than left. Blotchy red patches of the hands and arms developed.  She called Oncology on February 20 and it was recommended that she go to the emergency room for evaluation.    She was afebrile on presentation to the emergency room.  She was tachycardic, however, with a pulse rate of 117 bpm.  She was breathing at 48 breaths per minute.  Blood pressure was 105/80 mmHg.  Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 96%. Examination was notable for paraspinous muscle tenderness, tachypnea, mild respiratory distress, and a mildly distended abdomen.  Mild erythematous patches of the feet and forearm were noted, as well as evidence of edema of the right leg from the knee to the lower leg. The peripheral blood leukocyte count measured 0.8x10e3/µL.  ANC was 0.48x10e3/µL.  Platelets measured 96x10e3/µL.  Creatinine was 0.97 mg/dL.  AST was 86 and ALT 20 U/L. The lactic acid level of the venous blood was 3.6 mmol/L. The procalcitonin level of the blood measured 28.37 ng/mL. The C-reactive protein level was 313.7 mg/deciliter. The creatine kinase (CK) level was 4023 U/L.  LDH measured 314 U/L. Troponin was 3.22 ng/mL.  Urinalysis showed 6-10 wbc?s, 0-2 rbc?s/hpf, 3&#43; blood, negative nitrites, hyaline and granular casts as well as amorphus crystals. A chest radiograph showed possible, but not definite, mild atelectasis or infiltrate at the left lung base.  A radiograph of the right tibia/fibula showed circumferential soft tissue edema seen within the knee and upper to mid aspect of the lower leg.  EKG showed sinus tachycardia but no evidence of arrhythmia or ischemia. Cultures of specimens of the blood were obtained.  The patient was started empirically on vancomycin and cefepime and was admitted.   Faint erythema and ecchymosis of the right leg extending to the dorsal right foot and right wrist erythema were noted following the patient?s admission.  Her condition subsequently destabilized with increased respiratory rate, worsening pain, and hypotension, so she was transferred to the ICU. An abdominopelvic CT on February 25 revealed a small amount of free fluid in the abdomen around the liver, cholelithiasis with no evidence of acute cholecystitis or biliary dilatation, a nonobstructing 5-mm stone of the mid pole of the left kidney, coronary artery calcifications, mild infiltration of the fat in the inferior retroperitoneum and along the right common iliac region with small nodes in this region, similar compared with September 24, 2020, but improved compared with April 30, 2020, and consistent with response of lymphoma to chemotherapy; a myomatous uterus. A CT scan of the right lower extremity showed extensive edema about the subcutaneous tissues of the right lower leg and infiltration of the fat about the muscles of the right lower leg, likely representing cellulitis and fasciitis, and possible myositis. However, there was no air within the subcutaneous tissues or muscles to suggest necrotizing fasciitis and no evidence of abscess.     The patient?s antibiotic treatment was later changed to vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and clindamycin. Cultures of specimens of the blood were later reported as being positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on 2/2 sets.  Repeat blood cultures (February 26) were positive as well. Her antibiotics were modified to cefazolin monotherapy.  Repeat blood cultures on Feb 27 and 28 were negative.      TTE completed 2/27/21 without obvious vegetation.    TODAY (3/1/21): Cultures negative 2/27 and 2/28. Remains on IVIG. Afebrile. She complaints of continued pain in the Right leg and swelling at that left arm.  Exam GENERAL: NAD EYES: Sclera and conjunctiva clear   NECK: no adenopathy  LUNGS: Breath sounds normal and symmetric. No rales or wheezes. HEART: regular rhythm, no murmur appreciated ABDOMEN: Soft without mass, tenderness, organomegaly or hernia. EXTREMITIES: RLE with ecchymosis, slight overlying erythema and anterior blister: blistering more pronounced today. left foot with plantar erythema, some tenderness today.  LUE fullness with some heat/tenderness SKIN: No other rashes or other abnormalities are noted.  NEUROLOGICAL: alert, appropriate  Assessment  1. MSSA septicemia with shock. Positive blood cultures 2/25 and 2/26 thus far. Negative since 2/27.  2. Multifocal cellulitis and interstitial infective myositis of LE- suspect related to above. CT scan was negative for apparent necrotizing infection.  3. Elevated CK due to above- improving 4. Recurrent lymphoma- has been on maintenance rituximab (11/2020). Immunocompromised state.  5. Low immunoglobulins- remains on IVIG 6. Positive urine cultures with Staph aureus- this is typically secondary seeding from bacteremia rather than primary staph uti. CT abd/pelvis negative for nidus of infection along GU track (no renal abscess for example) 7. LUE swelling/tenderness.    Plan  1. Cont Cefazolin without change: goal dosing 8gm/24hr 2. Following repeat blood cultures, negative thus far (tentative D0= 2/27/21) 3. Pending course, anticipate likely TEE--- &gt; presently precluded due to thrombocytopenia 4. Will obtained LUE doppler for completeness given pain/swelling here. Down the line, may need to consider additional imaging (CT?) if concern for abscess, etc).  5. ID will follow along with you. Please call if any questions/concerns.   Patient is still admitted, and is in the ICU.

An 80-year-old female patient received the first dose on BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot/batch number: EN6200) solution for injection, via an unspecified route of administration in right arm on 15Feb2021 at a single dose for Covid-19 immunization. Medical history included allergies, hip surgery, and foot surgery three times. Concomitant medications included unspecified medications. Patient reported she has been so sick. She got the shot on Monday 15Feb2021, and that same day she got so sick, it was horrible. Patient had chills, fever, aches and pains, and if someone named it, it was there. She stated that before Monday she was 183 pounds, didn&#39;t know if it has changed as she has not been on a scale, but she was sure it has because hasn&#39;t eaten since Monday, as she has had no appetite. Her appointment was at 07:45, and she went right when she got up, so she did not really have anything to eat on Monday. Patient stated that on Tuesday, she did not eat anything until the evening when she had one piece of pizza. Today, patient has only had a yogurt. Today was the first time she has gotten out of bed and even felt like getting dressed and putting her contacts in, since Monday. The last few days, patient stated that after getting up and going to the bathroom she would walk downstairs and felt weak as a kitten (15Jan2021). Patient stated that she was at least 80% better, because she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door (Feb2021), and she was not a wimp, it was just horrible. Patient mentioned that she was on a lot of medicine, probably 10, but this was the first time she was receiving this vaccine. She stated that she was still having pain where the injection occurred (Feb2021), like when her shirt touches it, she can tell it was there. But patient stated that she had the nicest nurse and the injection itself did not hurt, it was just later, and the injection site got swollen (Feb2021). Outcome of the event she had felt like she was at death&#39;s door, chills, fever, aches and pains, felt weak as a kitten was recovering; no appetite was not recovered; while the other events was unknown.  No follow-up activities are needed. No further information is expected.

An 80-year-old female patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ended up in the hospital for 2 weeks with pneumonia and COVID-19 at the end of last Summer. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient&#39;s husband reported that the patient received the first Covid shot about a week to two weeks ago. She went to the facility and got the shot and was fine afterwards until she came home. Later that afternoon, she started showing symptoms of problems, was weak and couldn&#39;t walk, disoriented, wanted to sleep, was incoherent, couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t eat, was very, very much having trouble, shallow breathing. He tried to stay right her and eventually it got to be scary for him with her shallow breathing. He ended up calling an ambulance and she went to the hospital. They gave her tests and was there until about 4 or 5 in the morning before she started showing signs. She was dehydrated was a part of it. The tests were showing the symptoms were improving and she was beginning to come out of it fortunately with doctor&#39;s care because he didn&#39;t know what to do. He had been going through materials and she is coming up on another shot next Monday and does not want her to go through that if it can be helped. She was coming up for the second shot. Saw something on the tv that rattled him to his bones. It had been found that people who had Covid virus previously and then got the shot may not need a second shot. He is trying to flush that out to whether or not that is something or not that she should be considering. They have the card to go back to the same place for the second shot and they are trying to figure if they need to set up an appointment now. Hoping that this was the worse of it and it is hard for them to call back and his physician is not an expert on this and he got Pfizer&#39;s office contact number and decided to call. Outcome of the events was recovering.  Information on the batch/ lot number has been requested.

Saturday was so dizzy I had to hold on to walls and furniture to walk around house. Sunday was still dizzy and nauseous so I ate a sandwich and 3 or 4 tums.  All came up and I continued to vomit throughout the day. Could not even keep water down. Monday I had someone bring Ginger Ale. Nausea gone, but still very dizzy. Never had a temperature but continue to be dizzy.   I am a very active 80.  Clean my own house and Mow my yard.  I play bridge 2 or 3 times a week and walk my 2 Yorkie Dogs several times a week and never have been dizzy before.

They admitted me to Emergency because my blood pressure was extremely high-they said later it was about 187/ ?.  While I was there the blood pressure went up over 200 to 214/81.  I was dizzy and nausious and shaking because I became very cold even though the nurse covered me with 3 blankets.  After I left the hospital it took until after I got a prescription for meclizine filled and took one at 7PM before I was able to get the blood pressure down to a normal range - 130/64.  Today I am still taking meclizine as prescribed and am still slightly dizzy.  I do not know if this was related to the vaccine or not.

Around 2 a.m. (36 hours after vaccination), severe stabbing pains radiating from colon up through ribs on left side. Only shallow breathing possible; any more than that brought unbearable pain. Took 10 mg. of Bentyl  and another 10 mg about an hour later. Pain subsided in less than an hour after 2nd dose. Discomfort &amp; occasional sudden pain in abdomen, along with achiness, through the next day. Continued to take Benadryl.  Dr. reachable by phone only said this probably not a repeat of the diverticulitis I have had several times over the past 15 years but simply spastic colon. By 3rd day, only mild abdominal distress &amp; mild fatigue. I do not know whether this experience is related to the vaccine at all. I had no difficulties after the 1st Covid vaccine.

The patient was found not to be diabetic and was given some crackers, juice and water. She was offered to go to a private room for further monitoring, but declined. Her condition did not improve, so she was taken to a private room for monitoring and observation at about 2:30PM. Vitals were taken, she was still feeling poorly and had very high blood pressure (&gt;200 systolic). She declined the ED. At 2:40PM, her blood pressure did not decrease, so the ED was called to take her in, and she agreed.

I had the temp (not much as I take Tylenol for arthritis tid) and fatigue but my other symptoms were gastrointestinal. Epigastric distention, abdominal pain and nausea. It was over in approx. 12 hours. I had similar but more severe symptoms last April that I thought were food poisoning. Now I wonder if they were COVID-19 related.

They monitored me for a while until my blood pressure was at 160/72.  I opted not to be taken to the hospital at that time.  I ate a slice of toast, which stayed down, them took my morning medications.  They also stayed down.  I had liquids all day and some crackers.  Was dizzy all day. Blood pressure before retiring was 150/74.  Slept well last night and am still a little dizzy yet today, but appetite has returned.  Blood pressure is now 135/74.  which is about my normal.

An 81-year-old female patient received her first dose of bnt162b2 (BNT162B2 reported as PFIZER COVID-19 VACCINE; manufacturer reported as Pfizer-Wyeth; lot number: EL1283; expiration date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration left arm on 21Jan2021 12:30 at 0.3 mL, single dose for covid-19 immunization. Medical history included arthritis in back; always had diarrhea because she had cancer and is unable to control her bowels. They tell her she has a lot of fiber in her food; but she can&#39;t control it; if she eats vegetables then she knows what&#39;s happening; but she always tries to take Imodium A-D before eating vegetables. She mentioned to them if she did not eat vegetables all she could eat is meat and cheese; doctor told her she was borderline diabetic, so she has wanted to keep up with that. The doctor was not worried about it; ongoing acid reflux; pain; and ongoing high blood pressure. Concomitant medication included ongoing omeprazole for acid reflux, ongoing amlodipine for high blood pressure, naproxen for arthritis in back, caffeine, codeine phosphate, paracetamol (ACETAMINOPHEN WITH CODEINE) for pain, loperamide hydrochloride (IMODIUM A-D) for diarrhea. The patient has not received any other vaccinations within four weeks prior to the first administration of the covid-19 vaccine. Vaccinations reported as she has gotten flu shots and pneumonia shot and has never had any adverse events, reactions or problems with those; nothing. The reporter mentioned that she got her first dose of the vaccine in a clinic on 21Jan2021 and aware that the second dose will be on 16Feb2021. The patient reported that she felt bad after taking the first dose-flu like symptoms on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and had high fever Saturday (23Jan2021), urine became yellowish-brown and wants to know more information. The patient guesses she is having an allergic reaction on 23Jan2021 at 8:00 and asked for further information about the allergic reaction relative to the vaccine. On Saturday (23Jan2021), she was feeling good. She got up, went to store, came back and had little diarrhea symptoms then she began to get sick, feverish. She added that then the vomiting, then achy like flu symptoms. She still feels feverish, she has a really bitter taste, or no taste in her mouth really but it&#39;s going away. To her it seems like the worst part is over. She almost called 911 but then did not want to go the hospital because of all the people with COVID in the hospital. The next day on 24Jan2021, when she woke up, she was not as fevered. She can check her own self with her hand and it was like she put her hand on a stove. She went to sleep and the next morning (24Jan2021), she was not as feverish; her mouth still has that nasty, old bitter taste that does not go away with brushed teeth. She feels better today (unspecified date). She mentioned that the second dose is scheduled to be administered 16Feb2021, but she really does not want to go get that if she feels like this. She had blood work for her sugar done on 21Jan2021 because she is borderline diabetic, but results are unknown, have not had any results yet. The outcome of the events was recovering.

An 81-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection) (at 81 years of age), dose 2 intramuscular, administered in arm right on 19Feb2021 17:00 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. Historical vaccine included PFIZER BIONTECH COVID 19 VACCINE, first dose at 81 years of age, intramuscular in the right arm on 28Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunisation. The patient was not pregnant. The patient had not received other vaccines in four weeks. The patient had no COVID prior to vaccination nor was she tested post vaccination. She had no known allergies. The patient experienced a severe ulcerative colitis flare up starting within 24 hours of the 2nd vaccine. Initially, as a exceptionally private and stubborn person, she did not report her progressing symptoms to her family and only after she &#34;felt as if she was actively dying&#34; did she reach out for help (01Mar2021). Additional symptoms included severe burning pain across her lower abdomen, vomiting greater than 7 times, persistent diarrhea, gray skin pallor and she appeared slightly jaundiced. Patient refused repeated offers from daughters to be taken to hospital. On 01Mar2021, contact was made with her gastroenterologist and in the morning of 02Mar2021, she was restarted on her UC treatment, which was oral budesonide (unsure of dose). Outcome was improving. She was now able to intake food and liquids and her UC symptoms are resolving. She was up and active again. The events started on 20Feb2021 with outcome of recovering. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of the events.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information about batch/ lot number cannot be obtained.; Sender&#39;s Comments: Based on data provided and temporal association, the reported events are assessed as possibly related to BNT162B2. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Started feeling achy around 11:00 PM.  Took Tylenol.  Was achy all day Wednesday and took Tylenol every 4-6 hours.  Woke up Thursday morning and couldn&#39;t get out of bed.  I was dizzy and nauseous.  I got up 3 times to use the bathroom and couldn&#39;t even swallow water until 9:30 PM.  I had 1/2 cup soup and water that evening.  Thursday I was only slightly dizzy but was able to eat and drink.  I didn&#39;t feel well enough to leave my house until Sunday.  Today is a week since the second dose and I&#39;m almost back to normal, but still tired.  FYI, I did have COVID last March.  I was quite sick but not hospitalized.  I received phone calls every other day from the DOH during the almost 3 weeks I was in isolation at home.  I gave plasma 3 times after recovering.

This happens every night about one hour after sleep. I have no fever.   But I feel like I am in an oven.  Subsides about one hour later but extreme tinnitus continues.  During the day I feel hot but not the same intensity of the nightly attacks. Never had this before. I had a second shot on 2/26 and on that night it was very severe.  Still suffering to this date. Primary doctor does not know what I have.  Blood work negative except for two positive Ana antibody tests.

She took Benadryl on Wednesday afternoon after she called the doctor&#39;s office, she took the Benadryl thinking it was an allergic reaction, her swollen lips seemed like it was improved but now it was minor. She has had the tightening in her neck repeatedly since her thyroid nodule surgery but she felt the tightening of her neck was more intense after receiving the vaccine, it felt like the left half of her throat was tightening, it is sort of still ongoing but states it has sort of improved. Patient also mentioned swelling on left side where the nodule was removed. She was asking if she should get the second dose. She has an appointment for her second dose.

She was not sleeping but they were strange images, they were strange, they weren&#39;t normal. She says with that added in it sounds crazy. She has her vaccine card that says she should get the next one 15Feb2021. She wanted to avoid catching the corona. She had drank acid yesterday and she was wondering if that was causing her to have acid reflux. She clarified that she drank a lot of acidic liquids on 25Jan2021 and she was wondering if that might have had something to do with it, like orange juice and cranberry juice so she is wondering did that have anything to do with it, the acidity maybe made her stomach have acid reflux because she has had that in the past. She asked if she should go to the doctor. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                My mother called me when she was going to get her second vaccination. She was alive and well and living independently at her home. She could walk, talk, make her own food, wash and dry her own clothes and take her own baths.   After taking the second vaccination she went down hill. She became sicker and sicker and eventually she started coughing up blood. She decided to go to the hospital, another Hospital of facility. I don&#39;t know what the treatment was at that hospital but she was soon transferred to facility and that is where I was notified she was in the hospital and visited her there. After arriving they intubated her and said she had blood clots in her brain and heart. When I saw her after she transferred from Hospital to the Hospital I noticed one arm was swollen. Her legs were as they have been for the last 20 years and looked okay to me--no discoloration other than her regular discoloring at one right ankle and the same old same old slight swelling in the left ankle. The doctors and nurses were putting the blame on her legs but you could tell things were happening else where.  But as she got worse and worse at the hospital her right arm become more and more swollen with dark bruises appearing--the hospital staff took pictures. The left arm continued to swell and did not look normal at all. She apparently had bleeding in her left lung from a blood clot. She had three areas of her brain that add clots and some bleeding. She was constipated and gaseous when they cleaned her. They didn&#39;t treat her constipation which made being intubated worse because I feel that caused her intestines to swell, thus she also had bleeding in her intestines.  My mother died on March 17, 2021 at hospital in ICU. I was told they could not treat the blood clots because of the bleeding in her lung, intestines and brain.

She had felt well and had been in her usual state of health, and was able to cook and enjoy a turkey dinner with 5 individuals on 03/07/21, but on 03/08/21 she began to develop progressive generalized weakness up to the point where she remained in bed for several days.  She could not support herself when attempting to rise from bed.  She noted poor PO intake with nausea, no vomiting.  Loose stools for several days, no noted stool blood.  Did endorse waves of lightheadedness and had fallen backwards three times in the prior week, reportedly due to poor balance when standing.  She was unable to elaborate regarding the falls but admitted to hitting her head at least once, unable to say if she lost consciousness or if she felt presyncopal symptoms before falling.  She had initially presented on 03/12/21 to ED for evaluation, workup negative, labs and imaging normal.  CT brain found no acute process.  She was sent home with arrangements for home PT.  She returned to ED 03/15/21 when symptoms had not improved.  In the ED she was found to be afebrile, significantly hypertensive, mildly tachycardic, &#43; orthostatic vital signs.  Labs significant for heme occult positive stool, proBNP 397, WBC 10.1, H/H 13.4/39.9, PLT 493, UA neg for infection.  COVID neg.  CXR found slightly increased interstitial markings.  MRI brain found no acute intracranial abnormality.  She was evaluated by PT and found to be unsafe to DC home as she could not ambulate without leaning backward and to the right and needed 1-2 assist.  She was admitted to HM service for further management.  She has remained consistently afebrile.  She continues to experience significant gait instability, cognitive slowing, and difficulty with finger-to-nose testing with noted dysmetria, no focal weakness.

                                                progressive shortness of breath; hypoventilation; dysphagia; severe asthenia; mild upper abdominal pain; inability to eat; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician. An 83-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 14Feb2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included right partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in the remote past, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, morbid obesity, motion sickness, unspecified allergy as the patient cannot tolerate anything but paracetamol (TYLENOL), acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema. Ongoing concomitant medications included levothyroxine sodium (LEVOXYL) tablet, meclizine hcl tablet for motion relief and hydrochlorothiazide/ triamterene (DYAZIDE) capsule. The patient previously took paracetamol (TYLENOL). The patient previously received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot number: EL3247) on 22Jan2021 (at the age of 83-years-old) in the left arm and experienced difficulty breathing, ground glass opaque lung problem, weak, nausea, &#34;pain on rt.side waist around to back, down to lower belly&#34;, slight temp almost 100. On an unspecified date in Feb2021, the patient presented to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath and inability to eat for two days. The patient reportedly received the second dose of BNT162B2 four days prior to coming to the emergency room (ER). In the ER, the patient reported severe asthenia, mild upper abdominal pain and dysphagia, all as of an unspecified date. The patient underwent a CTA in the ER, on Feb2021, which showed no acute pulmonary embolism, or no ground glass infiltrates. The patient was admitted to the hospital on 21Feb2021 at 17:51 for management of worsening shortness of breath. Due to the patient&#39;s acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to centrilobular emphysema and obesity, hypoventilation (as of an unspecified date in Feb2021) was further complicated by obstructive sleep apnea, thus, the patient was admitted to &#34;MedSurg&#34;. The patient did not present with COVID-19 or COPD. The BMP was 226 at the time of admission. The patient was started on supplemental oxygen and additionally started on CPAP at night. She was seen by a pulmonologist who recommended Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR). Pulmonology also recommended to work-up any underlying unaddressed coronary artery disease contributing to the patient&#39;s shortness of breath. The patient underwent an echocardiogram on Feb2021 with regadenoson (LEXISCAN) for her shortness of breath which was within normal limits. As the patient additionally reported dysphagia at the time of admission, she was evaluated by a speech and swallow evaluation specialist as well as a gastroenterologist. A GI swallow series was recommended which the patient underwent on Feb2021 and was found to have no active signs of oropharyngeal or esophageal dysphagia. The patient additionally underwent a physical exam on 24Feb2021 at 08:00 with the following results. Vital signs: Temp: 98.2, Pulse: 69, Resp: 17, B/P (MAP): 98/62 (74), Pulse Ox: 96, O2 Delivery: Nasal cannula, O2 flow rate:2.00. HEENT: Pupils equal round reactive light accommodation, no lymphadenopathy noted, neck vens were apple. CVS: S1-S2 normal, no appreciable murmur rub or gallop noted. Respiratory: Good Inspiratory effort, good air entry bilaterally, no rhonchi, Rales or wheezes heard. Gl: Abdomen soft, nontender nondistended, bowel sounds heard, no organomegaly detected. Extremities: Bilateral lower extremities Shaw no edema, bilateral dorsalis pedis 2&#43;, skin appeared intact. Neurological: Patient alert and oriented x3, strength 5x5 in all 4 extremities, no signs of focal neurological deficits. Skin: No clear breakdown or rashes noted. The patient was being discharged home on 24Feb2021 at 08:04 with a CPAP machine. The patient was prescribed Cefuroxime axetil (CEFTIN) 250mg Tablet orally twice a day; Salmeterol Xinaf/ fluticasone (ADVAIR) 250-50 diskus 1 puff twice a day for progressive shortness of breath and hypoventilation. The patient had been advised to follow-up with a pulmonologist for an outpatient pulmonary function test. The clinical outcome of progressive shortness of breath, hypoventilation, inability to eat, dysphagia, severe asthenia and mild upper abdominal pain was unknown. The reporting physician considered that BNT162B2 had no causal effect on the events reported.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender&#39;s Comments: In agreement with the HCP reporter, the reported events  do not appear to be related to the subject vaccine. The events likely represent intercurrent medical conditions, possibly associated with the patient&#39;s history of  emphysema. This case will be reassessed upon receipt of follow-up information.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.

                                                Patient is a 84-year-old female presenting to the emergency room with anxiousness, generalized weakness and one episode of vomiting/nausea surrounding her Covid vaccination this afternoon.  On exam patient appears mildly anxious, has no evidence of allergic reaction, lungs are clear and equal bilaterally.  Patient is resting comfortably, speaking in complete sentences.  Shortly after physical exam patient was noted to have oxygen saturation of 90 to 92%, subsequently placed on 2 L nasal cannula.  Will obtain CBC, CMP, chest x-ray, EKG.  We will also give patient 500 cc of fluid and 4 mg of Zofran for control of nausea and vomiting.  We will continue to monitor patient. No leukocytosis, no AKI, electrolytes within normal limits, chest x-ray without evidence of underlying pneumonia or pneumothorax.  I have reevaluated patient, patient has been reporting a ongoing headache for which she has a history of and takes Fioricet, requesting Fioricet.  Will order Fioricet.  We attempted to take patient off of her oxygen however when taken off the oxygen she drops to 88% on room air.  Patient reports ongoing generalized weakness and nausea which has required an additional 4 mg Zofran.  Given that patient has been monitored for couple of hours and has had ongoing nausea and vomiting, generalized weakness in the setting of hypoxia when taken off of oxygen will obtain troponins and admit patient to the hospital for obs.  I have spoken to Dr. who has accepted patient to observation with telemetry for further management.  Patient was informed of admission status, with no further questions at this time.

An 84-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL0142, expiry date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration on the right upper arm on 21Jan2021 17:00 at single dose for covid-19 immunization.  Medical history included oral cancer from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing.  There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously received flu vaccine for immunization and reported that it made her sick for 10 days 4 or 5 years ago. The patient previously took Tylenol (takes 1 instead of 2, Everything she takes half the recommended dose). The patient experienced fast heartbeat, increased BP, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headache on an unspecified date in Jan2021. It was further reported that she had a fast heart beat, her blood pressure went real high, she was dizzy and weak. This was while she was there and being watched for the 15 minutes by a nurse. She is 84 years old and doesn&#39;t take any medication; she did have oral cancer but with no chemo as it had not spread and this was 2 years ago. It was explained that the patient didn&#39;t feel good about it but she drove home. When she got home she was confused and felt like she could pass out. She walked through the house didn&#39;t know who she was, she just kept walking and walking. It was a strange feeling that lasted 15-20 minutes. She called her son late in the afternoon and told him to check on her to make sure she made it through the night. She still had funny feelings over the next few days but at this point she only has the dizziness that happens occasionally. She notes also that her blood pressure was checked at home by her and was higher than normal the first few days after but is now normal. Over the next day she had a headache and a little nausea, but it was not severe. She also mentions having a little soreness in her arm but not bad. She did read about the side effects and states she had the elevated heart rate, increase in blood pressure and dizziness right after getting it. The patient wonders could she ask for smaller dose, she only weighs about 110lb. When she spoke with her doctor she was told that the COVID virus is worse than what she experienced after the vaccine. She has not been to the doctor since getting the vaccine, she just talked to them. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included blood pressure measurement: high and heart rate: fast on Jan2021. The patient was recovering from dizziness, the outcome of nausea was unknown and the patient recovered from the rest of the events on an unspecified date in Jan2021.

Familial history included all of her family that has passed, died of diabetes or cancer. Concomitant medications included unspecified other blood pressure medication and nifedipine for blood pressure. The patient did not receive other vaccination within 4 weeks.

Patient approximately 1 week ago was bending over to pick something up and fell to the floor landing on her coccyx, and has had increased low back pain since that time.  Patient does have a history of congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation.  Patient states that she had noticed increasing lower extremity edema and mild shortness of breath with exertion.  The patient states that her back pain escalated and she was unable to stand or walk on her own.  Patient was then brought to the ER for further evaluation per EMS.  The patient did have a CT of the abdomen and pelvis which showed no definite acute intra-abdominal/pelvic abnormality, and mild acute during L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 4 mm of displacement into the spinal canal.  Patient also had a CT of the lumbar spine without contrast which showed acute appearing mild L2 superior endplate compression fracture with approximately 2 mm of displacement to the spinal canal, and multilevel degenerative disc disease.  This morning upon entering the room the patient was standing with assistance of a walker and hospital staff.  Patient tolerated fair.   Patient does complain of severe pain with standing and movement.  Patient does have 3&#43; pitting edema to bilateral lower extremities.  Denies numbness or tingling to lower extremities.  Bilateral lower extremity pulses are 1&#43; 1&#43;, with CMS being less than 3 sec and skin is pink warm and dry.  Patient&#39;s EKG in the emergency room did show atrial fibrillation with RVR with a rate of 137.  Patient was given Cardizem IV in the emergency room, and then was started on Cardizem CD 100 80 mg p.o. daily.  Patient&#39;s rate is controlled at between 92 and 96 beats per minute and continues to show atrial fibrillation on the telemetry.  No shortness of breath is noted at this time.  Patient did also have lab work drawn in the emergency room CBC:  White count is 9.4, hemoglobin 14.4, hematocrit was 43.7, with a platelet count of 261.  Patient&#39;s CMP showed a BUN of 21, creatinine 1.2, potassium was normal at 4.6, and her GFR was noted at 41.  Patient also had a BMP drawn which was noted at 322.

She was unable to eat anything and needed to be helped back into bed. Her vital signs were stable (blood pressure slightly elevated) and she has had no complaints or issues since. I do not believe the resident had a bowel movement to coincide with her pain.

                                                I got the vaccine at 8 AM that morning and I was fine until about 5PM and I got very cold. I was freezing. I had a chill.  I checked my temperature and it was around 99-100. During the night I woke up with a bad chill, I was really cold and I was shaking really bad. I checked my temperature and it was 102. Tuesday I checked my temperature all day it never went over 102. I took Ibuprofen all the day, no more then 4 tablets. I took a nap in the afternoon for about 2 hours and I when I woke up I was really cold and I was freezing and shaking. I was so cold my teeth were chattering. My mouth was very dry, I tried to drank a sip of water, which made me nauseous and I throw up slightly. My husband was concerned because he couldn&#39;t get me warm and he called our son. Our son came over, and asked do I know who he is and I responded no. I have reconciliation of my son coming over or my husband calling our son over to come check on me. My son immediately to called 911, EMS arrived  and they transported me to hospital. I do not remember any of this, I didn&#39;t become appear until I was stretcher , at that point I became aware and knew the answers to the questions being asked but I couldn&#39;t respond. I remember hearing the EMT say to turn the air on, I was burning up and had a temperature of 105. I was transported to  Medical Center. They run a lot of tests and they were trying to get my fever down. Sometime late that night they were finally able to my temperature down. I was released about 10 AM on Wednesday morning. I have been fine since then.  The doctors who all seen me in the ER all said they have not seen anything like this.

An 85-year-old female patient started received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE; lot number: EL9264 and expiry date: unknown), via an unspecified route of administration on the right arm, on 01Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The first dose was received on 11Jan2021 (lot number: EL0142) Medical history included GERD. Concomitant medication included pantoprazole and other unspecified product. Patient got the first shot of the COVID vaccine three weeks ago, and she didn&#39;t know anything had happened to her. She got the second dose of the vaccine yesterday at noon, and she was fine, although she didn&#39;t sleep very well on 01Feb2021. But the morning of 02Feb2020, she went in the kitchen and dropped some blueberries because the plastic boxes don&#39;t close easily, and she bent over to pick the blueberries up and she got dizzy. She did not know why she should get suddenly dizzy, and her stomach seemed a little upset, but she has no fever on 02Feb2021. Patient was just wondering if the dizziness is a side effect of the vaccine. Patient had no other vaccines on the same day as the COVID vaccine and stated when she had the incident where she bent over and was dizzy, it felt just really terrible, but she was feeling fine now, but the incident did shake her up a bit. Outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient received second dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number: EC9231, expiry date Apr2021), intramuscular in the left arm on 09Jan2021 at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included COVID-19 from 13Apr2020 and she got a plasma donation, in Apr2020 because she was not in good shape when she had COVID. There were no concomitant medications. The patient previously took first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number and expiry date not reported) on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. The reporter said that the patient&#39;s doctor told her to still get the COVID vaccine and on 10Jan2021, she had been throwing up, sweating, and lightheaded and these were the side effects with the second dose. The caller stated that no one else had side effects like these. It was reported that the patient had no other family and the reporter felt really bad for the patient and wanted to get her some sort of information. The patient said that she was feeling a little better than she did last night, but she was laying in bed. The patient&#39;s symptoms started yesterday 10Jan2021, the next day after receiving the vaccine. The reporter said that the patient can barely speak to her. She said that the patient said that she was feeling a little better, but she just whispered it. The reporter asked if it was because the patient had antibodies. Clinical outcome of the events was unknown.

An 86-year-old female patient (mother) received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE) via an unspecified route of administration at left arm on 12Jan2021 10:15 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included ongoing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for years; COVID-19 Virus from 23Apr2020 to an unknown date, patient was not on a vent or in the ICU but did receive plasma as part of her COVID-19 Virus treatment; ongoing cough. Caller&#39;s grandmother had Multiple Sclerosis. There were no concomitant medications. The patient received her first Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine dose, and had significant side effects. Patient weight was 175 lbs as provided by caller, who stated her mother recently moved into an independent living facility, and gained weight because the facility has a really good pastry chef. Patient height, reported her mother shrunk, and was 5&#39;5-1/2&#34;. Reported her mother couldn&#39;t walk after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was not able to walk the next morning, 13Jan2021. The caller stated she had to spend 3 days with her mother, after her mother received her first COVID-19 Vaccine dose on 12Jan2021. Reported she thought initially what her mother was experiencing was either neurological or muscular. She said it was like her mother&#39;s brain wanted her to move, but her mother&#39;s legs wouldn&#39;t move. She said her mother needed to use a walker and have someone hold her from behind. She said now, at a week later, her mother still was not back to normal. She clarified her mother needed a walker to maneuver around, but didn&#39;t need someone holding her from behind. Reported she assumed her mother may have had tiredness, weakness, severe muscle weakness from receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She clarified if her mother wasn&#39;t able to walk after receiving the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose, then what her mother had was the epitome of weakness, and the weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body. She said her mother had tremendous fatigue on days 2, 3, and 4 after receiving the first dose. She said her mother was able to function as of 19Jan2021, but her mother couldn&#39;t keep her eyes open during that time period. Reported her mother developed a congestive cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not continual, but persisting. She stated her mother said the cough was there before she had her first dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine. The caller stated she disagreed with her mother. She said her mother has COPD, but her mother was not a cougher. She said her mother&#39;s cough now, reminded her of the cough her mother had when her mother had the COVID-19 Virus in 2020. She clarified her mother was tested on 23Apr2020 for the COVID-19 Virus, and diagnosed positive for the virus on 24Apr2020. The caller said she was perplexed by her mother&#39;s cough, and her mother will be seeing her doctor this Thursday, 21Jan2021. She said she gave her mother some Robitussin for the cough. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not persistent, but the cough was still there. She said her mother&#39;s cough was not constant, but her mother&#39;s cough was congested. She said she didn&#39;t know when her mother&#39;s cough started. She said she thought giving her mother the Robitussin doses was kind of insignificant, because her mother did not have a constant cough, where she needed to take the Robitussin. She said her mother didn&#39;t even use half of a normal sized Robitussin bottle. Caller stated she did not have the Robitussin UPC, Lot, and Expiration Date. Reported her mother has an annual lung x-ray and MRI, clarifying she believed her mother had both within the past 3 months. Reported her mother was concerned about receiving the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she told her mother that it was better to get the second dose of the COVID-19 Vaccine than to get the COVID-19 Virus again. Reported her mother had asked her primary care doctor if she should get the COVID-19 Vaccine, and her doctor told her absolutely. She said her doctor told her she needed to take the COVID-19 Vaccine even if she had the plasma treatment with the COVID-19 Virus in Apr2020. Reported she planned to stay with her mother after her mother received the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said she didn&#39;t anticipate her mother having a reaction after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose because people said most reactions are happening after getting the second COVID-19 Vaccine dose. She said now people are reporting having reactions after the first COVID-19 Vaccine dose. Reported she thought her mother&#39;s side effect after having the COVID-19 Vaccine to be unusual, since most people say it feels like they have the flu, or they are tired, or they have a headache. Reported her mother not to be able to walk wasn&#39;t that her mother was not walking, but that her mother&#39;s foot wouldn&#39;t move. She said mother not walking was either neurologic or muscular, unless that is what extreme weakness is. She said she wondered if others have experienced what her mother has. She said if her mother was experiencing just extreme weakness, the extreme weakness was only in her mother&#39;s lower body, not in her upper body. She said her mother didn&#39;t have an appetite, but her mother was not too weak to put a spoon to her mouth. She said her mother couldn&#39;t move her legs, and her mother said her legs felt stiff, or almost frozen. She said if her mother had extreme weakness, and couldn&#39;t walk, what did that mean. She said if a person is really tired, the person can still move and get out of bed. She said her mother said she was really, really tired, and couldn&#39;t move. The caller said her mother said she couldn&#39;t move, and it took her mother 20 minutes to get her legs over the side of the bed. She said her mother not being able to move her legs could be extreme weakness, but observing her mother first hand, she said it looked like her mother not being able to move her legs was neurologic. She said her mother was strong in character and body, and her mother would do everything she could in her body to move, but it was like her mother&#39;s brain said &#34;go&#34;, and her body said &#34;not now&#34;. The outcome of the event Congestive cough was not recovered, of the other events was unknown.   Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.

An 86-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EL3249, expiration date not reported), via an unspecified route of administration (left arm) on 21Jan2021 14:50 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history includes therapy on her back from the past, from an unknown date. Concomitant medication included melatonin to sleep and, paracetamol (TYLENOL) to sleep. The patient received the first dose of the vaccine on 21Jan2021 at around 2:50 PM, the next morning on 22Jan2021, she felt extreme exhaustion, she&#39;d get up and have to get back to bed, not able to eat, and she thought she has low blood sugar. She got up and had a bowl of cereal. On an unspecified date, the patient also reported numbness in face, legs and slight headache, and need to eat all of a sudden or pass out, and these has gone on for five days now (at time of report). The patient also reported that her lip has a slight droop on left side of her face which was concerning her. The patient reported that after numbness and not eating, she had some ice cream and her whole chest froze up, and it felt like she was having a heart attack. Her chest felt like ice which never had happened before. It has been an effort to talk, she was really working hard to talk. The patient explained she got the vaccine 5 days ago (from the time of report) and reported she had muscle tightness around her whole face, she had a slight droop on the left lip, a slight headache right across the eye brows, her legs feel a little numb off and on, she got feeling of tiredness but that passes, she had the need to go eat suddenly or she will get very weak. The reason for the call was she was wondering if she should she go for the second vaccine when 5 days after having the vaccine she was experiencing numbness. Slight droop on the left lip started but never looked close until the time of report, not a lot but the lower lip on the left side it is slightly droopy, with slight headache right across the eye brows. Her legs felt a little numb off and on, and she stated that about 3 days after the vaccine, she was afraid to take a shower because her legs weren&#39;t steady enough. They are still that way at the time of report, but this did go away for a while on a day and she was able to take a shower. She also didn&#39;t feel well after the vaccine. On the day of the vaccine, she had a good dinner and felt good; but the next morning she was very weak and could only stay awake for very short amounts of time. She was in bed and couldn&#39;t stay up and this is not like her, she did not like to be in the bed. She got the feeling of tiredness but that passes and she can stay up for longer periods of time. She had to go eat or she gets very weak, she didn&#39;t feel like eating in the beginning. It was on the 4th day after the vaccine she would have to get a bowl of cereal all of a sudden or she would feel like she was going to pass out. She never had trouble with her stomach like this before where she felt the need to have to go and eat. She explained she never had trouble with stomach, she never had headaches, and never had a vaccine before. Muscle tightness around her whole face started 2 days after getting the vaccine and was getting worse. Her face felt really tight almost numb feeling. The outcome of the events was unknown.

                                                In the afternoon after getting the vaccine she was eating an ice cream bar and had a time trying to eat it, it did not go down and it did not go down.  She ate dinner and at 10:30 she had terrible burning that went through to her back, had shortness of breath like she could not catch her breath.  Her daughter took her to the ER as the pain was so severe she thought she was having a heart attack.  In the ER they ran a bunch of tests, did an EKG and took blood, she did not have a heart attack.  She was admitted and monitored her.  She did have a chest x-ray in the ER as well  Nothing showed blood clots in her lungs, nothing in her lungs, but she still had the SOB and the pain went away.  She thinks they may have given her some medicine and the pain was gone, but she still was shortness and still is today 3/19/21.  She has an appointment next week to have an echocardiogram.  She has had check ups with the cardiologist and her PCP since coming home from the hospital.  Her PCP gave her an inhaler to use but she has not used it.  She did not have any reaction to the injection site itself.  Ever since this has happened has had no appetite, brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue and nothing sounds good to eat  She can taste okay, but nothing tastes good to her.  She said she doesn&#39;t think she can handle this much longer, it&#39;s been over a month.

An 86-year-old female patient received her second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided) at the age of 86-years-old, via an unspecified route of administration on 24Mar2021 at 14:00 at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included high blood pressure diagnosed in 1971 (reported as 50 years ago) and ongoing; type 2 diabetes in 2011 (reported as 10 years ago) which resolved in 2019 (about 2 years ago) after the patient lost some weight; she had an episode of A-Fib in 2019 when her potassium was low (lower than the current hospitalization), once the potassium was corrected, her A-Fib resolved. The physician stated that patient has shrunk and was now about 5 foot 2 inches. Clarified that this has not recently occurred since the vaccine; stated it was happening just with age. The patient received her first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, lot number and expiration date were not provided), via an unspecified route of administration on an unspecified date at single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient&#39;s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient did not have any issues with the first dose of the vaccine. She received her second vaccine dose on 24Mar2021. The physician spoke with the patient on Friday, 26Mar2021, and the patient was fine. On Saturday, 27Mar2021, the patient had an episode of diarrhea, vomiting and was weak. The lady cleaning the patient&#39;s house found her slumped against the wall. The physician met them at the hospital and said the patient seemed okay. They thought it was just an issue from her potassium being low on Mar2021, so they gave her that. The hospital did a CT scan that showed nothing on Mar2021. The hospital did an MRI of the head that showed multiple small emboli in the brain on Mar2021. The physician believed that the patient must have thrown more clots because she became aphasic on Mar2021 and could not name things. The patient also had difficulty walking on Mar2021. The physician felt it was important to call and report this since she has heard of people throwing clots with vaccines. The physician did not know if the events were related to the vaccine. The patient was in the hospital for 7 days (as reported). She was now able to walk with some assistance. The patient&#39;s son thought that the patient was okay when he went to see her. Since the reporter was a physician, she knew which questions to ask the patient and saw that she still had some problems. The patient could remember some things but has problems with recent memories on an unspecified date in 2021. She also has some confusion on an unspecified date in 2021, such as she thought she was in a boat hospital. The physician was uncertain if the vomiting and diarrhea was somewhat better. They were wondering if the patient has some food sensitivities (2021). The patient also had carotid studies done in the hospital on Mar2021 and they were fine. They believed that patient&#39;s potassium dropped, and she went into A-Fib and threw clots on Mar2021. The clots must have come from the heart valves since the carotid studies were fine and if the clots had been in her legs, they would&#39;ve gone to her lungs not to her brain. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included CT scan: negative, potassium: low, carotid studies: fine, MRI of the head: multiple small emboli in brain, all on Mar2021; and potassium: low, height: 5 foot 2 inches (shrunk), and weight: lost, all on an unspecified date. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness and fall required emergency room visit. The outcome of the event difficult walking was recovering and unknown for all other events. The events diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, fall, potassium low, cerebral embolism, thrombosis, and &#34;potassium dropped and she went into A-Fib and threw clots&#34; were assessed as serious due to hospitalization and being life threatening; and the events aphasia and gait disturbance were assessed as serious due to hospitalization. All other events were non-serious. The patient was hospitalized from 27Mar2021 until 02Apr2021.   Information about the lot/batch number has been requested.

                                                Same day as when patient received the 2nd vaccine, she was overcome with generalized fatigue and nausea.  By the 4th day, her legs would not hold her when she tried to stand getting out of bed.  She was nauseous to the point of not being able to eat or drink.  Infact, she did not have the strength or desire to eat or drink.  By the 5th day post vaccine (02/20/21), I took her to the Emergency room because she was so fatigued, she just slept, and couldn&#39;t stay awake to eat or drink.  She was able to get to the car with a walker, but that was the last time she walked.  After time at hospital and then Skilled nursing, she passed away on 03/21/21.  She never regained the ability to toilet herself, eat on her own, failed to eat and drink, and eventually was put on hospice because she lost 30 pounds over the month from failure to eat or drink, even though I was there or the nurse was there to feed her every meal, and try to get her to take fluids.  Her fatigue was just overwhelming. When she first arrived at the emergency room, she: ? Presented with 2 days of weakness and AMS; fever, nausea  and generalized fatigue ? Word finding difficulty; without stroke or acute abnormal on CT or MRI; according to the Hospital

An 87-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (UNSPECIFIED TRADE NAME, Solution for injection, lot number: EL3248), via an unspecified route of administration on 18Jan2021 at single dose in left arm for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included leg problem, it&#39;s severe pain in the right leg in the back; very bad nerves. Concomitant medication included oxycodone hydrochloride, paracetamol (PERCOCET [OXYCODONE HYDROCHLORIDE;PARACETAMOL]) for pain in her right leg. The patient had severe pain in her right leg and she was going to pain clinic for that, he was giving &#39;Propacet&#39; for that. Caller stated that she had the injection on Monday (18Jan2021) at fair grounds, its the Covid Vaccine. She didn&#39;t feel good the day she got it on Monday. Then Tuesday she felt good. Wednesday (20Jan2021) she was sick again, and having pains in the stomach, well she can&#39;t say stomach, but also towards the afternoon around 2&#39;o clock, she got light headed and dizzy, she felt like she was about to pass out (21Jan2021), and she thought to herself she had to hurry and get something to eat and that feeling last 4-5 hours. She took a pain pill when she got something to eat, and thought to sit down watch a program to take her mind off of it because she felt like she was going to die (Jan2021). After the pain pill and the food it seemed to get better. She wakes up in the night crying (Jan2021), because she was scared if she didn&#39;t get better the shot would kill her. Maybe it&#39;s her nerves getting the best of her. Her son had the vaccine and had no side effects. She wanted to know if she is the only one having the side effects. While on the phone with this call handler, caller states that she was starting to get dizzy again but she just had breakfast. Her First Dose was on 18Jan2021 Mon, and on the way home she said to her son she was getting dizzy/ lightheadedness. Her son said to her its not from the shot, but she was getting dizzy. On 19Jan2021 Tuesday, she felt good that day. On 20Jan2021 Wednesday, she was Sick again, with weakness, dizziness, she can&#39;t get to feeling herself and she had Pain in the stomach. On 21Jan2021 Thursday she felt dizzy, like she was going to pass out. On 22Jan2021 Friday she was feeling dizzy again, and her stomach was acting up and she was weak again. Caller was dizzy and weak. The dizziness was a different each time, sometimes she has got it, sometimes she didn&#39;t, its intermittent, she would be doing something and then she needed to grab a hold of something when the dizziness come on. Her Weakness was about the same.  She was not feeling the stomach pain right at this minute, when she woke up during the night with it and last felt it 5 or 6AM this morning, she had chores and tasks to do this morning, but her heads going at that time also around 5 or 6 o clock, it was about the same as Wednesday, she just felt like she needed to get something to settle her stomach down, like she needed something for the energy. When attempting to get the product details, caller states that she was getting old, she provided EL3248, she needed light to read it. The card did have an Expiry date but she can&#39;t read it, it&#39;s 20 something, she just can&#39;t read. She was on nothing new. She took a pain pill when she got home but it didn&#39;t help, she was still dizzy. The pain pill was Percocet, it was dispensed in a brown pharmacy vial. Medical Conditions: She has a leg problem, it&#39;s severe pain in the right leg in the back, she wears a back brace, she needed an MRI Monday. Caller stated the date 12Feb2021, but did not confirm what this date was for. She didn&#39;t know how she would get the MRI if she didn&#39;t feel better. They were trying to pinpoint the pain in the leg. They tell her that she was in good health for 87 years of age, when they put her in back brace she felt good. On Monday when she got up there she was a little weak and they put her in a wheelchair that day, this past Monday. She had No results to share but she had a X ray a couple weeks ago (Jan2021), and that would lead up to MRI she was going to have. Caller stated that she had very bad nerves, her husband passed away 2 years ago and she hasn&#39;t overcome that, she lived by her-self, and was wondering if some of this stress, would lead to the symptoms she was having right now. She wanted to know if these are normal side effects and if it safe to have the second dose. Caller stated that she was slow and old. Consumer further stated, she didn&#39;t know if she got the right party or not. She just want to know if she was having a reaction to the COVID-19 injection (COVID-19 Vaccine) that she had on Monday, she didn&#39;t have a (distorted voice) that serious, like the whole Monday she was sick, Tuesday she felt fine, yesterday she was so stressed she can&#39;t hold her head up today she felt good but about 2 o&#39;clock, she had pain in her stomach and she had it all the time, the pain in her stomach was like she had an ulcer and all of sudden she feel like she was little warm (Jan2021) and had to pass out and then get something to eat and sit down and take something for pain and it last about two hours and then go away and about 4 hours later she got it right back.

Spasms in stomach continue to date, as do weakness in legs to the point of using a walker to get arounds, and an overall feeling of unwellness.  Have had no fever.  Contacted personal physician 8 days after vaccine and was advised to take Tylenol, which I have been doing for a few days, but am now taking consistently every 8 hours as directed.

She woke up around 5:00 AM and was a little light headed, but as the day went on she found herself holding onto the wall and then had to get her cane.  She does have Meniere&#39;s disease.  She had a sick stomach, not nausea.  Some days were a little better than others.  She got up slower, and that didn&#39;t help that situation.  She called her doctor and told them how she was feeling, and she was asked if she wanted to come into the office, and she declined.  Then a few days went by and she did not feel any better.  She reached out to her family and they told her to call somebody and that&#39;s when she read her paperwork and called us.

On 24Feb2021 they called the doctor and told them that she had collapsed again, and he said to stop the cyclobenzaprine and changed tramadol dose to half strength. She started being shaky. On 26Feb2021 they called the doctor back because she had the same symptoms with the addition of vomiting. They said to stop the tramadol and start taking TYLENOL. On 27Feb2021 they went back to the urgent care for the same symptoms as well as leg pain, thigh pain, hip pain, being really shaky and real weak.

An 88-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EM9809) intramuscularly, administered in left arm on 23Feb2021 at 10:30 (at age of 88 years old) at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization; gabapentin, via an unspecified route of administration from 08Feb2021 to 15Feb2021 at 100 mg, daily, then via an unspecified route of administration from 15Feb2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported; Expiration Date: 08Feb2022) to an unspecified date, at 200 mg, daily for feet burn. Medical history included hiatus hernia surgery from Nov2019, surgery from an unknown date, vomited after surgery for three nights/days, gastrooesophageal reflux disease (GERD), cancer, feet burning, feet red, asthma and thyroid. Concomitant medication included paracetamol (TYLENOL EXTRA STRENGTH), fluticasone propionate, salmeterol xinafoate (ADVAIR) taken for asthma, montelukast sodium (SINGULAIR), fluid pill, vitamin D, vitamin C, potassium, acid reflux pill before nighttime before supper, thyroid pill, singulair pill. The patient previously took Codeine and percocet [oxycodone hydrochloride;oxycodone terephthalate;paracetamol] and experienced allergies. Two years before in Nov2019 she had hiatus hernia surgery. Her stomach went into her chest. She was in rehab. She had to have the surgery done twice. She went from one hospital and then she went to another and it was taken care of there. When she went to rehab after her surgery, all she did was vomit day in and day out. Her current vomiting reminds her of this experience. They finally did take care of it. She came out of the hospital and was vomiting. She clarifies she had problems with vomiting for the last 6 months before this current experience. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s eating. They say it&#39;s acid and she has Gerd. She does try to get her exercises in. When she was in the hospital, they found she had cancer, which they are just watching for now. When querying what kind of cancer she has, the caller explains she didn&#39;t have them do a biopsy. She didn&#39;t want to go that far into it. She didn&#39;t want any extensive treatment. At first, they were keeping check of the cancer every 3 months. Now, she is going ever year. She last went in November. The patient experienced macular degeneration on an unspecified date, vomiting on 23Feb2021 at 17:30, temperature 99.2 on 25Feb2021 at 10:00, very tired on 23Feb2021, arm was sore couldn&#39;t lay on it on 23Feb2021. Patient had the first Covid vaccine Tuesday morning, clarified to 23Feb2021 at 10:30AM and around 5:30PM that night she started vomiting. She vomited all night long and all day Wednesday and Wednesday night, and this morning. So far, it had stopped. She was trying to hold water down, but she couldn&#39;t keep water down, the water would come up. She clarifies further she tried to take a sip but it kept coming up. She called her doctor who was a practitioner and she told her to drink ginger ale and maybe crackers. She told the doctor that her daughter sent her electrolytes and she was told that was fine to take. She tried toast this morning and she couldn&#39;t hold it down. She&#39;s been eating very slow, taking little bites at time and she had been holding it down. She did have temperature of 99.2 on 25Feb2021, but half hour or so before it was down to 96 now. She couldn&#39;t take medicine that she normally takes because she&#39;ll throw it up anyway. She tried to take a few of her pills but it didn&#39;t stay down, she threw them up. Around 9am, she took her thyroid and that stayed down. So far, that&#39;s doing good. She takes Advair for asthma and she took that, that&#39;s okay. She took her singulair pill. So far, the three of these medications have stayed down, and she took 2 Tylenol. Patient took Tylenol twice. She knows it was Extra strength, took 2 pills Tuesday night but it didn&#39;t stay down. She Took 4 Tylenol today, 2 pills this morning and 2 right before her CNA left at around 3pm. Caller mentions she can&#39;t see the dosage on her Tylenol bottle. She doesn&#39;t see the dose. She mentions she will get her magnifying glass to check it out. She&#39;s afraid because she had surgery a couple years before and she vomited after surgery for three nights/days, or whatever. Today (25Feb2021), when she spoke to her doctor she was advised to call Pfizer to let them know how the vaccine is affecting her. Right now, she feels pretty good, but she was very, very tired. She&#39;s going to lay down when she gets off the phone. She had a CNA with her today and she also spoke to the nurse practitioner. The last time she vomited was around 10am. When the CNA came in, she told the caller to call the doctor but she told the CNA she&#39;d be fine. However, the CNA urged the caller to call her doctor and let them know what was going on. Her second dose was scheduled for 16Mar2021. Her doctor told her don&#39;t drink the water, drink the ginger ale and don&#39;t drink it too fast, and try crackers and toast. The patient took her temperature last night (24Feb2021) but couldn&#39;t read it that great, she thought it was 98. When the CNA came this morning (25Feb2021), she took it around 10:00AM and it was 99.2. She told the CNA to take another temperature because she didn&#39;t think she had a fever. When the CNA left, she had to leave at 3:00PM, her temperature was normal, it was 96. She thinks maybe her temperature went to 99.2 because she was drinking her tea. However, she wasn&#39;t drinking it right away, because she threw up on it. She stopped drinking an hour before her temperature was taken. She clarifies wasn&#39;t drinking the tea when the CNA came. She also mentions she broke up her the toast into little tiny pieces and felt like she was eating like a bird, but it didn&#39;t stay down so she stopped. The CNA came around 9am, maybe 8am, and clarifies it was maybe around 1030AM when she took the temperature. When the CNA left her temperature was at 96. The patient was very tired the same day she received the vaccine. She remembers went to bed with clothes on. Last night, she wanted to go to bed again with her clothes on but she couldn&#39;t stand it and she changed into her pajamas. Then, she went to the bathroom and vomited, she has a bucket by the side of her bed. It wasn&#39;t the dry heaves, stuff was coming up. She was still very tired currently. She makes the comment &#34;I forget things and then I remember afterwards&#34;. She had to get under the light to see the Covid card, it&#39;s small, it is handwritten. Caller mentions she sees the month on it. Caller reports her arm bothered her for quite a while. Last night, she went to sleep on her left side and her arm was feeling better which gave her some hope.  Her arm started hurting her the day she got the vaccine, but her arm wasn&#39;t red or anything. Her arm was feeling better this morning. She thinks if she can sleep on it and didn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s getting better. The last pills she took were Gabapentin she has been on for about 2 weeks. She explains her feet burn during the night and the doctor recommended the Gabapentin for now. However, she has had too much time trying to stop the vomiting that that took over her feet burning, so her feet didn&#39;t bother her as much. She was initially prescribed 1 pill at night before going to bed at 10pm, then when the 1 pill didn&#39;t work for a week, the doctor increased it to 2 pills at bed time at 10pm because it takes an hour to work. She stated that she was going to take the Gabapentin on Tuesday night, which was a mistake because she threw it right up and it tasted awful. Caller makes the comment she has not given the doctor the report of how that reacted yet. When probed for an NDC, Lot number or expiry date for the Gabapentin, the caller explains she can&#39;t see writing, it&#39;s in small print. She does see the Discard After: 08Feb2022. She needs to get her magnifying glass, she states she&#39;s going blind. She&#39;s been told she had macular degeneration. She doesn&#39;t think the Gabapentin is agreeing with her. She reads that it &#34;May cause drowsiness, operating vehicle which she doesn&#39;t drive, may cause dizziness, may cause vision. Call if you experience mood changes, sadness, depression..&#34; She started out taking one pill of the Gabapentin every night from Monday to Monday. The second Monday, 15 Feb2021, she started taking 2 pills at night for a total of 200mg. She took it this past Monday night until she had the vaccine and then she took it again, and now she was not taking it anymore. Her burning feet wake her up during the night, it starts at her ankles and goes halfway up her leg. She had to put her feet on a cold floor. Normally, she feels good and she usually doesn&#39;t get pain so whatever little bit of pain she has, that&#39;s the pain she gets. Her feet were burning like that for month before she called the doctor. she didn&#39;t know. Her feet were red before they started to burn, this is the latest thing. During the day, she is fine, only a nighttime her feet burn. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included body temperature: 98 on 24Feb2021; 99.2 on 25Feb2021; 96 on 25Feb2021. Therapeutic measures were taken as a result of vomiting. She was going in for a test, clarified as an MRI on the 3rd of March for her eyesight. The action taken in response to the event for gabapentin was permanently withdrawn on an unspecified date. The outcome of the event &#34;Pain in arm&#34; was recovering, the outcome of the event fatigue was not recovered, the outcome of the events &#34;temperature 99.2&#34; and &#34;Vomiting&#34; was recovered, and outcome of other events was unknown.
